0,J House,United States,2023-11-02,2,"My wife and I paid a great deal to fly Premium Economy on Iberia. The only aspect of the flight that was worth the extra fee was the seat. We were able to reline and sleep during the flight. However, all the other amenities were poor. First, my wife and I have TSA Pre, but Iberia does not pay the TSA fee, so we had to go through the 'regular' line. Our seats were between Business and Economy. We could hear and smell the crew preparing the meals for Business, but our food came after economy had been served their dinner. We were not allowed to use the nearby Business class toilets but instead go to the end of the aircraft (passing all economy seats) to use the toilet. Before we arrived at our destination in the morning, we received our breakfast, which was a box with a small roll and a juice/fruit container with no spoon with which to eat it. After we had eaten, they came around with a thermos container of coffee which was poured halfway into a paper cup. This was not the premium economy for which we had paid! I will not fly Iberia again and I am disappointed that American Airlines, which we normally use, uses Iberia as a partner.",A330,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Dallas to Madrid,September 2023,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2,no,True,Dallas,Madrid,

After numerous calls they sent the luggage to Amsterdam, but never to my hotel. I had to go the airport and pick it up, which incurred an additional cost in taxi and time lost from my vacation. When I finally got my luggage they had cut the luggage and removed the lock, ruining my brand new luggage. They also went through my luggage and opened my personal items. There was no one from Iberia at the airport. I called to report my damaged luggage and was repeatedly placed on hold. I filed written report on their website when I got home and they told me the incident needs to reported within 7 days. Are they serious? What lack of professionalism and ethic.

11,R Palmer,Mexico,2023-08-04,1,"I received the worst possible treatment from a flight attendant. On that flight I paid additionally for seats near my husband and son. When boarding the plane I found my seat occupied by a person. The flight attendant gave it to him and he didn't want to change it. She told me to sit somewhere else and I explained that I had paid for them and that it was important to be close to my children for personal reasons. Still, she insisted that the man was taking my place to be close to some teenagers (note that there was a space available between the teens and in the middle section Right next to it, so I don't understand the need to take my place when there are more spaces available and appropriate for the care of people in their late teens). I did not accept giving up my place and the flight attendant cursed me saying that I am inflexible and that life was going to give it back to me and that she hoped everyone is inflexible with me (in front of all the passengers) which was insuring and made my daughter cry and made us have a very difficult, awkward and unpleasant trip. I filed a complaint of which there was only an acknowledgment of receipt by the airline and they never communicated anything to me again, closing the file without any notification or report. The plane has very small spaces, it is uncomfortable and the dining table cannot be extended or placed. It was very Unfortunate what happened. Why is the point of this airline selling seats when their flight attendants take them away and curse and insult the client in front of the rest of passengers when the experience they supposedly sell is nice?

On the outbound flight, they put us on the plane's last row (from my booked and paid row 23). After we sat, other passengers came claiming the same seats and we had to be separated and moved to middle seats. On the returning flight, I confirmed the seats over the phone the day before the flight and still, they separated us and assigned us in middle seats. During check-in, the agent lied saying that they had changed the aircraft (not true) and that I had allocated seats but not confirmed seats - when I showed her the email from Iberia showing confirmed seats, she became hostile. During the 12 hours flight, the entertainment service and Wi-Fi crashed. I applied for a refund for the almost $400 I paid for the exit row seats and Iberia refused to refund me. The whole situation is so absurd that it is almost unbelievable that an airline can be this callous. Customer service was unhelpful and condescending.

Our Stroller was not broken once in any of these flights. We have delivered the 3 pieces of the stroller to the Iberia team, each well-folded as we always do. We received a unusable broken stroller, broken in 5 separate locations over each of the 3 pieces. We complained and after having our time wasted in the airport, without any alternative solution offered (it’s not their problem our week long trip to Barcelona is ruined, where we have 2 toddlers and no stroller), were asked to also file a complain digitally. That led to an endless game where Iberia refused to pay for the damage. They made up a “broken beyond repair” certificate which “every store has” and “if only we got it we will be paid back”. We have gone to several stores, both dedicated kids/stroller stores and large chains who sell strollers like Walmart and Target. No one has heard of that certificate. When explained to Iberia they insisted it exists and will only pay if we get it. When we asked for “just one example of one store that has these certificate in Texas” they refused to provide one example, and repeated the mantra. This is beyond poor customer services.

However, the flight was on time, even a little early and I was convinced that I’ll catch my next flight which was scheduled for 2 hours later.  The ground crew could not attach the gate to the door and it kept passengers on the plane for over an hour, enough to cause many passengers, including me to miss their next flights. The stunning part was the passive attitude of the flight crew which did nothing to communicate the situation, and when they finally did it was only in Spanish. No offer for support whatsoever, and a wait and see attitude. The usual follow up after the flight with an email to request feedback also missing.

16,P Halera,United States,2023-07-12,1,"We booked a flight from Madrid to Los Angeles with American Airlines, from MAD to London Heathrow with IB, and from there a flight to LAX with AA. We only had 90 minutes to catch the connecting flight, so when our IB flight was delayed for over 2 hours, we knew that we weren't going to make our connecting flight. I spoke with an IB employee while we were still in Madrid, and asked them if we should still fly to LHR since we're missing the connecting flight (or at the very least, start making accommodations for an alternate connecting flight). The IB employee said that there's nothing they can do at MAD, so we should take the flight to LHR and that they would figure it out once we arrive to London. We arrive at London 3 hours late (2 hrs from the delay at MAD, and another hour at the gate at LHR because the door was jammed and they couldn't get it open). Once we finally got out, there were no IB employees at LHR (they leave at 8pm), so we went to AA's customer service. Well, AA can't help us because it's IB who was delayed. Only problem is that all IB employees are gone for the night (they won't return until 6am), and their 24-hour customer service is trash. The IB customer service reps that I spoke with said that since I bought the tickets from AA, that it's AA and not IB who have to book me a new flight home. After 4 different phone calls totalling 90+ minutes on the phone, IB was able to book us a flight to Paris, and from Paris take a 13-hour flight to LAX.  Also, not once did they mention that we can get a hotel for the night and that they would have to reimburse us. However, we know our rights as airline passengers, and when I mentioned this, the IB reps were vague as to how I can get reimbursed, or what my allowance was.

Upon arriving at Barajas Airport, we proceeded to the baggage claim area, and after waiting for approximately an hour and a half, we went to the Iberia counter to file a complaint. The airline provided us with a receipt that had no logo or much information that could identify them. It should be noted that none of the passengers on this flight received their luggage, so the airline should easily identify what happened. The luggage was finally delivered on the eve of our departure to Rome, which means that we spent our entire stay in Madrid without our luggage. Upon my return to Mexico City, I initiated the process of filing a complaint regarding the inconveniences caused by this airline, and initially, Iberia showed a willingness to provide a refund.

We had flight confirmation for all of us with American Airlines and were flying out of Boston to Barcelona with Iberia which was part of the booking. When we arrived in Boston for our flights to Barcelona, we were told by the Iberia agent that four of our family members had boarding passes but one of our daughters did not have a confirmed pass. I showed the agent the emails I had received stating that all members of our family had been confirmed for the flight with American Airlines (through Iberia). We had flown to Boston from Indianapolis so I was able to show the Iberia agent our luggage tags for all five of our family members showing that we had confirmed flights for everyone from Indy to Barcelona with a layover in Boston. The agent searched and again said that she didn't have any record of our daughter being confirmed for the flight to Barcelona and was told that we needed to go to the American Airlines counter to discuss. We had already spent about 45 minutes with the Iberia agent at this point. The check-in counter for American was 1 mile from the Iberia counter and there were no shuttles available at that time to take us to the other terminal. All five family members ran from Iberia to AA (15 minutes) only to find out that there were no agents at the AA counter. It was now about 1.5 hours before our flight was to leave. So we ran back to the Iberia counter and told them there was nobody at the AA counter. I asked them to look again to see why they weren't seeing my daughter's boarding pass and how would it be possible for us to have all of our luggage for all five passengers from Indy to Barcelona approved on the initial check-in if we all did not have boarding passes. I asked if they could check to see if there was room on the flight to add my daughter because at that point I was desperate to get her on the flight and was willing to pay the money to make that happen. The agent said that ""Yes, there is room on the flight"" but that we need to book the flight with American. At this point, we had spent an additional 30 minutes arguing with them and it was getting close to the time that they were shutting the doors for the flight. Another Iberia agent was calling American for us and we were told that there was now someone waiting for us at American Airlines counter at the other terminal. We ran back again to the American Airlines counter and talked with an agent who, within three minutes, pulled up the information showing - Here is my flight information with all five family members showing each was ""ticketed"" and confirmed for all of the flights.

However, my joy quickly turned to frustration when I discovered that I had been double charged for the same flight. I contacted Iberia, and they claimed it was a mistake from their end. Despite this, fixing the issue proved to be a daunting task. Every time I called them, I received different responses, and the problem persisted. Eventually, I contacted my bank to dispute the transaction, and only then did Iberia respond. They canceled both of my tickets, even though the mistake was theirs. They claimed both charges were legitimate, despite providing proof that the tickets were suspended. After making numerous phone calls to Iberia, I was told that the flight might be canceled. However, if I did not ask, I would not have received a refund. I was also informed that the two tickets were valid and non-refundable, which was not the case. It is unacceptable for a large airline like Iberia to charge a customer for two non-existent tickets. To make matters worse, I am still waiting for a resolution to my problem. It has been a never-ending cycle of claims, phone calls, and false promises.

They finally agreed to put us in a taxi for 3.5 hours to Madrid, arriving about 4:30 am, and then departing about 11:30 am. We asked for a place to rest for a few hours. The customer service personnel instead thought they were being generous by giving us vouchers to use for breakfast “at any of the food places in the airport” which proved to be untrue as most places wouldn’t accept them.

The boarding process was chaotic - everyone lined up in the jetway and then delayed as wheelchairs were wheeled slowly past us. My outbound experience with being unable to reserve a seat (the American codeshare should have entitled me to American premium economy options which Iberia ignores and wants to charge for) was repeated. Fortunately I arrived at the airport so early that I was given an aisle. As I had waited for boarding, I heard from several other travelers who had booked directly on Iberia in coach and premium economy with the same seat selection complaints and even worse: they had been assigned seats well before but were changed at the airport for no reason, even having paid the assignment fee. The food from Madrid was just as bad as from Boston. My choices were beef and pasta. I was seated in the second row of premium economy and there was only pasta after the first row of 7 people had made selections. The pasta contained some pasta and a wilted indeterminate vegetable with sauce, lots of sauce. The end-of-flight snack was equally poor - a soft roll with pressed white something in it, probably turkey but certainly not Serrano or Iberico ham.

Queue at Bengurion airport for pre check-in security screening was insane, almost 2 hours. Then at check-in they let us know we needed a mask and we were downgraded to premium economy due to an aircraft switch from Iberia to Level. Bearing in mind Lufthansa and KLM have A320 on this route, I do not see that as an issue, especially since I was travelling on mileage. She apologized. Had to stop at the duty free to buy a mask. Skipped the lounge as I went straight to gate for boarding. The seat was not that bad, pre-departure drink. Staff really courteous. Meal ok. The staff was available for request, and the in flight entertainment was ok. Remote stand. Off boarding was delayed, because there was a passenger who was extradited to Spain who had to be off boarded first, which caused delays. Security screening in Madrid efficient.

It's greedy and ridiculous. In an emergency situation it's probably downright dangerous. We were packed in so tightly that we couldn't even get out without the person in the aisle seat having to move, or bend over to pick up items on the floor. My mom had pain and cramps the whole time from being jammed in so tightly. The PA barely worked so no one could properly hear what the captain was saying, and free wifi was advertised, but only actually given to people in business and first class. Everyone else had to pay extra if they wanted it. Any kind of service was painfully slow, probably due to the small aisles. However, the food was actually very good and the entertainment selection wasn't bad. We also weren't sent our boarding passes until a few hours before the flight, causing unnecessary anxiety. Additionally, we were forced to wear our masks for an 8-hour transatlantic flight.

I told them that my final destination was going to be in another city, and the representative promised they would deliver it to the address that I'm providing them.

The flights itself were fine and on time, the food was decent, there could have been more service during the long haul flight. The customer service however is an absolute nightmare. It started with their agent at Munich airport. He assured me multiple times during the checking that my bags were checked all the way to Talara and as proof gave me the bag tags with destination “TY”. I asked multiple times whether I had to take out the bags in Lima to clear customs and he declined. In Talara my bags weren’t there. I filed the form with the staff at the small local airport and ever since (3 days now) am waiting for my bags. Since Latam operated the last flight it is their responsibility to retrieve the luggage according to Iberia. That has been their standpoint during all calls I made. Latam however says they are only retrieving the bags out of curtesy since they were supposed to clear customs in Lima - hence not their fault that they weren’t on the flight. After I saw Talara airport I was sure that the information given to me in Munich was false. Talara is a small domestic airport with no customs. If international baggage could be checked all the way here smuggling would be super easy. I still have no idea how this fact was not known by the agent in Munich. As a customer you feel helplessly lost between two companies which both blame each other for being responsible. I would have expected more from Iberia's customer service than stubbornly repeating that it is Latam's responsibility. Especially since right now the baggage seems to be stuck in Lima with Iberia and the Talara airport stuff says that there are problems receiving the luggage from them for transport. In summary: fly with them but triple check any information their agents give you - it might be plainly false and you have no proof or anything if you simply rely on their spoken advice. Funny sidenote: only after the third call to their customer service they admitted the baggage should have been retrieved in Lima.

Then when we left Marrakesh the attendant at the checkin counter forced me to check in my carry on. Told me I could not board if I didn’t as it was a full flight. I told her we had a 40 minute transfer in Madrid and that I was worried our bags would not come with us. She assured me they would, now we are in Croatia and have been waiting 3 days for our bags. Totally ruined our time here as we have to stay at our accommodations in case they show up. No answering phones, no replies to messages, no response to lost baggage claims.

64,Nancy Jimenez Mota ,United States,2022-08-16,1,"Where to begin, I guess at the beginning. At check-in their computers were down, so it took a long time to check our luggage in and get boarding passes. Very unhelpful and not service oriented - I pulled up the health screener of my final destination, TLV, but it was not in a format they wanted so they said I would not fly if I couldn't pull it up. 3. Poor customer service. My seats from Madrid to TLV could not be assigned in DFW because they have subcontracted employees without full rights. Our first flight from DFW to Madrid got delayed, which is not a huge deal, but it got delayed even further because they could not match the passenger list with the amount of people on board. The flight crew could not understand the delay either, which they expressed to the passengers. Madrid to TLV was ok. TLV to Madrid 8/12 flight got moved up, I had to change my itinerary, customer service number would hang up on me. I could not find Iberia employees at the airport. Flight delayed and unprofessional - We were told the computers were down, they used a different airplane, and that we could sit anywhere. Then the ""musical chairs game began."" They started moving passengers left and right to balance the plane, just during take off and landing, then we could go back to our seats. The crew looked confused and dumb, like they didn't know what they were doing (because they didn't). Uncaring and very poor customer service - At Madrid they would not even consider putting me in an earlier flight, after disrupting my schedule, that was operated by AA on Iberia’s behalf because according to the Iberia agent: “They won’t give money to AA for taking you back.” At my arrival in DFW my luggage never arrived, despite being there way early, and the agent they had was again a subcontracted employee without access to their system, very young and untrained. He provided me with a handwritten form to fill out, no reference number was given to me. I did that and left because I was exhausted. 9a. Went to the airport the next day, Iberia’s counter was nowhere to be found, no employee available, nothing, just a ghost airline! The next day I call customer service and they could not help because their system was down, I proceed to explain my ordeal and worries about this flawed system and she replies - “I don’t control what happens at the airport and then cut off the call and sent me to a survey. Second CS call - She had said to call customer service back in 2 hours. I called customer service in 3 hours and the agent located the luggage in Madrid. I asked her to open a formal claim for my luggage, she said she couldn’t do that through her system. I exclaimed - “Then what are my options? I couldn’t do it at the airport, and I can’t do it now either.” She recommended for me to go to their website and fill out my complaint. Third CS call - I explained that I’d like to know if my luggage was in transit, the CS guy asked me for the reference number, and I explained that this airline is not like a normal one that would issue one at the airport. He assured me the luggage was in transit but without that PIR (reference number) they would not deliver it to my house, and I’d have to get it from the airport myself.

Finally, after requesting missing miles once again, AAdvantage sent me a mail denying my request on grounds of ""Airline unable to validate"". This is despite that I sent the boarding pass issued by Iberia and that my AAdvantage number is printed on the boarding pass itself. It really is disappointing.

The food is nothing special but it is not bad but the wines are all from Spain and lack a little delicacy. The crew have always been very efficient but never particularly friendly. Lavatories need cleaning a bit more during the flight, Best of all is the simple transit in Terminal 4S, I have never taken longer than 15 minutes from the arrival gate, through security and to the departure gate .. much longer if you do not continue with planes flying out of other terminals.

The response I received was unbelievable: for short and medium distance routes (like mine) Iberia uses probably older aircrafts where space of the above head lockers is calculated as: 1 carry on every 3 seats, I therefore wonder: is it normal or professional avoiding to mention this to the customer at the time of reservation, in light of the fact we are talking about the official air Company of Spain whose tickets are substantially expensive?

This is completely unacceptable to me. We have to wait 21 days before the airline will confirm our bag is lost, meaning we are unsure what we ought to replace and what we should wait for.

This time it cost 52 Euros, which is a pretty good price and worth paying. I got to airport only 2 hours before as I was busy during the day, checked in my carry on (you can for free) as I was filming this experience as well and went through fast track, which was close at London Heathrow, you only got to skip most of the line. The flight was leaving from Gates C, but there is no lounge there, so I went to BA lounge right after security, which was a bit crowded, but managed to get a seat, got some snack and drink, for hot food you have to use QR code and order online, but didn't have much time as boarding started already. Took me like 15 minutes to get there, but you can board any time using priority lane, unfortunately everyone boarded through one jet bridge, even though there were more doors and it could have been done differently. On board I had seat 3L which was really wide, comfortable and I like that its 1-2-1 so everyone has aisle access which is great, unfortunately my IFE wasn't working so I was moved to 8A which is exactly the same type of seat, most private one which is exactly what I wanted so all good. There is no pillow or blanket on this 2 hours flight which makes sense and no pre departure drink which is lacking a bit. Headphones are good though and I can't complain. Seat in general is very wide and comfortable and I'm sure I would be comfortable to be there for 10 or more hours. Business class passengers also have free Wi-Fi, even though only basic, but better than nothing. Service started around 30-40 minutes and there were two food options, I took a beef and it was good, its served on the tray, but I get that its short flight and for drink I got gin and tonic and coke. Overall happy with service, as for IFE, there are plenty of choices and I'm sure I would have enough things to watch on 10 hours flight. Overall really good experience, just one little thing, crew pretty much always start speaking Spanish and keeps doing it, would be better if they first ask you if you speak Spanish and than try to remember at least for business, I get that economy is too big.

No one was able to change it. Until the last operator, that wanted to charge me as I was not doing the change online, even if I repeatedly let all know then system on line was telling me online was not possible! The operator told me that I needed to go to the airport. Zero empathy along the 45 minutes and the 4 different operators. They just didn't care and this is always true every time I had to call them. I had to go to the airport and got it changed at the ticket desk! All this with a business ticket. Now imagine the other times when I flew economy. How the company keeps on doing this, I don't know.

Anyway we had to scramble to get a different flight (through Swiss, wonderful service) to Madrid instead because it was the only other flight to Spain that day from LAX.

I purchased a ticket on their website that was listed in Euro (112.6 Euro), but then got the receipt, which was in pound (112.6 Sterling). I am from the USA and that resulted in approximately $20 difference. Twenty dollars was not much to get worked up about, but it was so absurd that I had to call. After much back on forth with representative, I was told I would be credited the difference. However, when I got my credit card bill a month later, I realized that the representative had actually given me a credit for 112.6 Euro. That drove me to the website to see if I still had my ticket. Sure enough, my booking no longer existed. So basically I ending up paying $20 to not have a ticket and by this time tickets had almost doubled in price. At this point, I have spent hours on the phone trying to get this issue resolved. Even if the mistake is so obvious, the customer representatives have resisted doing anything about it. Finally, after much nagging, they agreed to look further into it and get back to me in a week. In the meantime, no ticket. A fiction writer could not have come up with a more bizarre set of circumstances. Finally, I just bought another ticket since otherwise I would be stranded and hope they will reimburse me back to original price plus the $20 difference. We will have to see.

The dinner was dreadfully presented on a tiny tray (size of a coach meal tray) and in a very oldish and ugly china. No menu with the usual Covid excuse. So I was asked ""Beef or fish?"" and when I asked how they were prepared I got the 2 same words snapped back to me. Food was eatable but certainly no more than that, and the presentation did not make you hungry. Appetizer was canteen style, meat was tough and overcooked, cheese truly bad and desert bad. Apart from the beef or fish, no choice. To be honest the wines were good but once again no menu to know what you were drinking. Between the dinner and the breakfast we never saw a crew member: doesn't Iberia train the cabin crew to treat decently business class clients decently?

108,K Kooistra,Netherlands,2021-11-14,4,"The A350-900, a first for me and I was very excited to fly Iberia for the first time.  The flight was a big disappointment. The problems started at check-in; long queues and unclear instructions on what Covid documents were required to show at this stage caused the queue to move very slowly. Boarding was not much better, the process was slow and unclear.  Passengers stood in wrong rows and the order in which people were being boarded was very chaotic, causing a long queue in the jet bridge. After a 45 minute delay and everybody onboard, IB3166 left Madrid for London. The crew handed out a small sanitation kit and a small bottle of water. There were no menu cards available due to Covid and the menu was not available on the IFE. There was no option to purchase other food or drinks or any of the luxury items Iberia advertises on the IFE, a bit disappointing since I was planning on purchasing some food for my short layover at LHR. The seat on the A350 impressed me, it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom, a relatively large IFE screen and adjustable headrest. The IFE shut down after 30 minutes into the flight and the flight crew refused to help me by resetting the screen. The crew seemed tired and not interested in the passengers. The flight attendants were not visible during the flight and did not respond to people calling for help using the button on the IFE. This caused issues upon arrival at LHR, they did not have a system for deboarding, passengers were queueing in the aisles and pushing forward towards the exit of the aircraft. A very disappointing experience and I expected the Iberia crew to perform far better than this. In conclusion, Iberia showed me to be an airline which is just average when it comes to these flights. The seat on the A350-900 was amazing, but the fact that there was no food service, no system behind the boarding process and the flight crew being uninterested in the passengers experience showed me that I would rather pay more to fly another airline on a route such as this one.",A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to London,November 2021,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,2,no,True,Madrid,London,

In summary, customer service on and off the plane is atrocious.

I haven’t flown with them for some time, and I did not have high expectations when reading passengers comments on this web site and elsewhere. However, most of these comments are about refunds, cancelations, missed connections, missing bags, rude service on board or on the ground, or about problems when trying to contact the airline. Nothing similar happened and I am glad to report that everything went well and was (nearly) perfect for these two flights, in both cases onboard brand-new planes (a A321 neo of Iberia Express, then a A320 neo of Iberia iself). The only criticism I could have is that legroom is limited in C as in Y class, but we secured seats on the very first low (1F & 1D, the 1A and 1C), and this was less of the problem because of the bulkhead. I shall limit myself below to report the service we received on the ground and and in the air, for which all employees and crew members should be complimented. I hope that this will be good for their morale in these days ! Check in at Lanzarote airport was a breeze, as was going through security. We were there early, and spent some time in the small, but nice common lounge, equipped with a side terrace where we enjoyed our last sunny hour of the year. Boarding was done in good order, but we had to go down and up via stairs, despite the fact that an airbridge was available at that stand ; but this Iberia Express, isn’t it ? We took off on time, and a hot lunch was quickly offered thereafter (with above average gnocchi as the main course). The two hours or so of this flight went quicky, and we found that it was just too short. We had a two-hour transit at the busy Madrid hub, where we retired to the much larger, somewhat crowed Iberia Lounge. Boarding for the connecting flight was again on time, and it went as well in good order in these COVID days. Take off was somewhat delayed, but arrival in Brussels was on time, as some recovery margin is built into the schedule. Another hot meal was again quickly offered, this time in the late afternoon (with a steak of a decent size and very tasty ; this was our day of luck !). Crowning this, there was an excellent Rioja 2017, of which I asked for (and got) a second (small) bottle (whereas I did not ask for a second one of the dry white on the previous leg ; airline wine is sometimes as military music). Landing in cold and rainy Brussels came also too quickly, and our suitcases arrived soon on the carousel after a long, but enjoyable journey.

We had a number of out-of-pocket expenses as well as having to take extra time off work. Firstly it was very difficult to get in touch in Iberia. Every time we tried to contact them by phone we were cut off. We were unable to access anyone via the web using the online forms, as they were restricting us from entering information. We tried to go to one of the Iberia counters at one of the airports and they were closed. We sent numerous messages through Messenger on Facebook that were unanswered. Only when we tagged Iberia on a public post on Facebook did they start to answer a message. Even then we were given the run around. Firstly we were fobbed off to BA, who subsequently wrote back and said it was Iberia's responsibility to deal with a particular issue. Iberia advised we could contact Serviberia. When we accessed it, it said 'sorry this page has flown'. Eventually someone in Iberia gave us a correct link we could use to contact Serviberia. The response through Serviberia to our complaint was very disappointing to say the least. It seemed to be just some template letter with a few standard phases and an opt out clause that allowed Iberia not to help us. We just hope that no one else has to go through what we had to endure.

Also I am sapphire in One World for being Paltinum in American Airlines. When the Agent went to deliver my bags to the Iberia counter in Berlin, who spoke very bad Spanish, he did not know the rules of One World. I assumed that traveling in Business I was entitled to at least one suitcase for each passenger but apparently this is not the case. Then I explained to him that because he was a sapphire he had the right to a suitcase in the reserve and he did not recognize me. I ended up having to pay 110 Euros for luggage over the 168 I paid for the business upgrade from Berlin to Madrid and the 63 for the seats on the Madrid Oporto flight. I called Iberia and they informed me that business tickets are always entitled to one piece of luggage. However, the agent in Berlin forced me to pay even while going in business. It seems inconceivable that you have to pay for luggage traveling on business.

I would have spent more time in the lounge if it wasn't for the BA staff at LHR T5 not printing my boarding pass so I had to spend 25 minutes at the Iberia transfer desk. After my boarding pass was issued, security was a breeze. I went straight to the Iberia Premium Velasquez Lounge where I was greeted by happy and cheerful agents. Food and beverage options in the lounge had an outstanding selection. Boarding was on time on this very full flight and very orderly. I have oneworld Sapphire status putting me in Group 2. Upon boarding the plane (EC-LUK 'Costa Rica'); the plane was 7 years old and did not show its age. The cabin was very spacious and very clean. The onboard crew were very welcoming, warm and friendly. Amenity kit were distributed along with headphones which were pretty much the same as what BA offers their Club World passengers. The amenity kits were of high quality which is pretty much similar with what some airlines offeres in their business class cabins. The amenity kits did not came with socks, ear plugs and eye mask which were all of high quality. The dental kit was disposable, the bag as a whole is very practical and reusable. Welcome drinks were offered with a choice of orange juice and water in plastic cups, I asked for both and without hesitation the crew were happy to offer both. The whole seat appeared to be clean. High quality blanket and pillow were already on the seat which I later found to be very comfortable for the 9 hour flight. The IFE content had great selections of the latest films in Hollywood which was enough for the 9 hour flight. In total there were more than 50 films in the selection. In addition to films, the IFE also came with a great selection of TV programmes. The disappointing bit was that the Audio selection was poor. We took off on time and the entire flight was fairly smooth. The meal and bar service was average at most. Drinks and food were served the same time. The options were chicken or pasta and I opted for the former which tasted great. Only soft drinks, tea and coffee and wine were offered. Spirits were for purchase. After the meal service, the cabin crew came with a second round for drinks, at this point everyone was resting. The cabin temperature was kept comfortable. The toilets were kept clean.Throughout the flight, the cabin crew were doing hourly rounds of drinks and ensuring the well-being of passengers. I decided walk around, the economy cabin looked immaculate and faily full. Everyone seemed comfortable. I also noticed that the economy seat recline was more than industry average. I was at the back of the plane stretching my leg and had a nice long chat with one of the cabin crew. I requested if I could have a spare amenity kit and I was given one without hesitation. I had a 3 hour nap and I must say it was one of the most comfortable sleep/ nap I had on a plane. The recline was outstanding. The second meal service came with a warm croque-monsieur which was outstanding. In addition, drinks service was included. The plane landed on time. The captain kept us well informed of the flight progress. One thing that I noticed was that the Wi-Fi was fairly expensive. Iberia has lost marks on the basis of: expensive Wi-Fi, the need to pay for Spirits on board and the poor selection music selection.

Therefore I have no means to contact this company. I understand that there is high call volume right now but I expect to eventually get through to talk to someone.

So, at check in we were charged the full E40 despite the person behind the counter admitting they were having issues with 'manage my booking'. On board, there was no included catering in economy. Nor were there menus in the seat pockets so you could try an make an informed choice about what you could buy. Rather, the staff came through the cabin waving the menu as in 'here it is'. We asked to buy some wine, but were then advised that the credit card machine was not working (and as we were leaving Europe for Australia we had spent the last of our Euros at the airport).

Before the flight, no information was given to us, one flight attendant told us we were going to make it to our connection on time (also a Iberia flight), but the story changed during the flight. And so we arrived in Madrid too late and we missed our connection. I don't blame Iberia for a technical incident or whatever caused the delay, but once arrived in Madrid, we were told to go at the Iberia help desk to solve the situation. When we arrived at the help desk, there was already more than a hundred people waiting there. And there was no queue and no organization whatsoever. There was  no Iberia staff to be seen except 4 employee busy at the help desk which we had no way of contacting. So we started waiting. This is when we discovered that they were from other planes and some of them were waiting here for more than 4 hours already. At one point, an employee of Iberia finally came out. Naturally, we went to her to ask question. At least to know if there was any form of queue to reach the help desk. So we tried talking to her, in a polite and calm way, and she look at us and .. directly turn her back. Every time we tried to talk to us, she ignore us. Then she started shouting in Spanish.  So we had no clue what was going on. People started rushing to her and she started giving paper away. After a while a person was kind enough to explain to us that she was giving away number for the queue (which didn't exist since people had already been waiting there for hours with nobody organizing anything). At this point it was already too late and we ended up being 150th in the waiting list. So then came 4 hours of waiting to finally reach the help desk. During this time we had to wait standing, with no food and no water -  they didn't even bring water and refused to give voucher for food (against EU traveler rights).  And the help desk was not really helpful, they just book us a new flight and told us to go on. We were pressed on and not given a choice about flights or to spend the night in a hotel and fly the next day.

That was the only update from the company. Phone customer support refused to deal with the problem. The flight was marketed under Level, an airline brand under which Iberia operates low-cost flights, so we were told to call Level. Level customer reps, in their turn, kept sending us to the operator, Iberia. Level website clearly states that Iberia is the operating carrier for flights to Barcelona. After a dozen back and forth calls we were told to go back to Boston Logan Airport. At the airport, we found over 200 frustrated passengers from the same flight - and no Iberia representatives. None. At the airport information desk we were told that Iberia refused to give any updates to Boston Logan. 2 Iberia reps appeared after 1 pm on December 8, that was 15 hours after the flight was supposed to depart. Their initial response was - again! - to tell us to call Level. Or Vueling? Or someone. And to keep waiting. No attempts to book passengers for other flights were made. Eventually, Iberia reps said they needed to write down passenger names and ticket numbers. When I asked why, they told me they needed to send that information to Iberia office in Madrid. Seriously?

Once I left the plane, I found out that there was no transfer desk or customer service desk available. I eventually found a staff member at a random boarding gate, who told me that there are no more transfer desks near any boarding gate areas (they used to exist before) and that missed connections are now handled at check in. I would have to leave via luggage claim and go to check-in. I did, only to find a crowded service desk with 3 or 4 ladies in red uniforms chatting to each other. After waiting for 20 minutes and no progress in the line, I decided to check the Business class service desk, where a very friendly staff member decided to help me, confirming my new flight in the next morning and giving me a hotel and food voucher for the night.

I booked my trip with Iberia, not knowing that this company was going to use another company called Level for my return to the USA. The awful experience started when I was trying to do my check-in online. The system did not let me finish my check-in and I got a message saying ""If you are unable to complete the process, the boarding passes can be received at the airport."" The system also asked my if I wanted to check in an ""extra"" luggage. Since I only had one luggage with me, I decided to ignore this (one piece can't be considered extra luggage, specially on an international trip). When we got to the airport the lady from Iberia told my friends an I that we needed to pay $90 for our luggage. I explained to her what happened during the check-in and that the system did not give me the option to check in the first luggage, however, she ignored the claim and we had to pay for it. In addition, we asked the lady if the meals were included and she clearly said: ""yes, two meals are included."" The trip lasted 12 hours and 50 minutes. This airline did not offer a cup of water during the whole trip, the flight attendant had a list with people's names, and only those people received a meal. The person sitting next to me, received a whole meal, while my friends and I were not offer anything (literally, not even a cup of water, for the whole trip). The people sitting behind me were really upset and they told the flight attendant that they had paid 30 euros for their meal but since they were not in the list they did not receive anything. The flight attendant told the lady ""if there is extra food when we finish serving to whoever is in the list, I will bring something for you."" On top of that, we tried to purchase some food and the screens on the seat indicated that the store was closed. My friend needed to take a pill and asked for a cup of water, they responded: ""we only have water for purchase."" There were so many unhappy people in the plane that all we heard during the trip was complains. In addition, it was super cold in the airplane and the airline did not provide blankets or anything, only for purchase, but again, the store was closed.

After this, he not only checked up on me to make sure everything was okay, but couldn't do enough to make my journey as pleasant as possible. It really made my flight back to England the best it could be and helped ease the pain after watching Tottenham lose the night before.

It is now Monday and still I am without my baggage. It is very difficult to call Iberia by phone.

Once connected to a live person, they only repeat the data that you can log on and see for yourself. No mechanism exists regarding confirmation of the location of your bags. While the Iberia staff are polite, they really have no mechanism to assist, and were unable to help.

When flying long-haul these days I prefer to pay a bit more for Premium Economy in order to have extra space and a slightly better level of service. With Iberia I feel that it is not worth the additional expense and is a very poor Premium product. Whilst the seats were comfortable and the IFE good, the service was pretty sub standard. There was no pre-dinner drinks service, with beer, wine and soft drinks being handed out with the meal. Spirits were not available but there was an announcement saying these could be purchased later (No one came round to offer so assume you would go to a galley to get them). The meal was a choice between chicken and pasta - when I asked what was in the pasta the cabin crew member serving me had no idea and said I could open it and check and hand it back if I wanted the chicken instead. It wasn't bad but you really would think in 2019 that crew know what they are serving given all the issues around allergies. There was no proactive offering of a second drink and I had to ask for one, though bizarrely they did offer more bread rolls - when everyone had already finished their meal! The crew then disappeared after clearing dinner and made only cursory passenger checks through the night. Breakfast was served about at an hour before landing in MAD- the main element was a warm cheese and tomato roll that was stuck to the box it was warmed up in, and took a while to loosen. The late serving of breakfast meant there was a mad rush to get it cleared and the cabin ready for landing- this wasn't achieved and we touched down with seats not upright, window shades closed and video screens not stowed away. Overall a poor experience and if you are going to offer Premium Economy at least invest in the product - British Airways have done this quite successfully so it is a mystery that their sister company hasn't.",A340,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Bogota to Madrid,March 2019,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2,no,False,Bogota,Madrid,

246,Emily Hart,United States,2019-01-18,1,"On Thursday, December 27th, my fiancé and I were scheduled to fly New York to Madrid. At 8:30, we all lined up to board and then after standing for 30 minutes with no direction, we were told that the plane had a mechanical issue. For the following three hours, we were given vague and unhelpful updates roughly once an hour. This was stressful since it was getting later and later in the night. Finally, close to 11:30, we were told the flight was cancelled in Spanish. The message was not repeated in English for another three minutes. We then proceeded down to baggage claim and there was no one from Iberia to direct us or tell us what was happening. We waited in complete confusion for close to 30 minutes. Finally, we were let through a door and told to write our name, phone number and email on a white sheet of printer paper and that they would be getting buses to take us to a hotel. Everyone on our flight was very confused why we were being asked to write our information down as we assumed that any airline would already have this information in their system. At this point, we took a cab and returned to our apartment in Brooklyn to attempt to get some sleep. We were told we would get a phone call or text letting us know when the plane was fixed. At 2:53AM, we woke up to the sound of a text saying our itinerary was changed. We were now scheduled to leave on December 28th at 18:59 to London, have a three-hour layover and then take another flight from London to Madrid. I immediately called Iberia and spoke to an incredibly rude customer service rep. She told me that Iberia already changed my ticket for free so any other change would require a fee. I have never heard of a policy like this. I knew there was a 5:00 (17:00) direct flight on Dec 28th and I at the very least I wanted to get on that. After a very frustrating conversation with no apology or resolution, I attempted to get more sleep. At 7:05AM, I got another text saying that our original flight was delayed to 15:30 and to call the airport at 12:30 to check. I immediately called Iberia to ask about that flight status and why our itinerary didn’t show that flight and the customer service representative could not explain this. They said that the 15:30 flight did not exist and/or that we didn’t have tickets on it. At this point, we were confused whether we should go back to JFK with no ticket or go for our new flight with the connection. I finally reached a customer service rep,  who told us there was nothing he could do. At that point, I asked to speak to his manager and suddenly he said that he could get us on the 17:00 direct flight. I’m confused why this wasn’t an option from the beginning. When we arrived at the airport and returned to our original gate from the previous night around 3:45PM, we were told that our original flight from Thursday night departed at 3:30 (15:30). I do not understand why we weren’t given the option to be on that flight. The lack of clear communication is unacceptable. I have submitted a formal complaint to Iberia about the situation, asking for reimbursement for the cabs and hotel room we had to pay for, but did not use in Spain, and I was sent a generic apology email saying it was out of their control.

A nice lady at the carousel was already informed of the occurrence and prepared a claim for us. Apparently this is something that happens quite often. She pointed out to a pile of baggage from the previous day, same flight. She said the baggage would be delivered to our location the next day. We were a little disappointed because the baggage contained all the kids' clothes and presents for the people we were visiting, but it's a busy time to travel, things like that happen and we were pleased with the way things were handled until then. The next day nobody called to schedule the delivery, nor the baggage was delivered. So the day after (December 23rd) we call the airline. A gentlemen speaking a bad English informed us that the baggage was likely in Madrid but could not confirm the location or when it would be delivered. Likewise, no information on the Iberia website. We would have to call the next day. That was starting to be a little too much annoying. Finally on December 24th we were informed that the baggage was boarded on the flight to Chicago and that it would be delivered the same evening or at latest the next morning. At night we found a voicemail informing to call before 8:30pm or the next morning for the delivery. So on Christmas morning we called, we were informed that the baggage was actually at the airport closest to our location (about 20 miles away) but it would not be delivered because Iberia does not pay the courier. If we wanted our suitcase, we would have to go and pick it up at the airport! That's what we did. Of course we issued a claim, requesting compensation for the emergency clothing we had to buy, for the travel expense to go and pick up the baggage and for the inconvenience of having to do so on Christmas morning after waiting for the baggage for 4 days.

Safety didn’t seem to be a priority as far as pre-take off and landing checks were concerned. Very cursory cabin checks were undertaken and large carry on bags were allowed to remain on seats for both take off and landing. The crew seemed totally disinterested in the safety implications. Food and beverage service seemed to be a chore. On one occasion I went to the galley to request a drink, two staff were idly chatting to each other. Despite one of them certainly being aware of my presence they totally ignored me and disappeared in the other direction!

263,M Gardner,United Kingdom,2018-12-01,3,"Disappointing flight from start to finish. Think twice before booking. We booked to fly to Lima, Peru through British Airways (BA) and they routed us on Iberia (IB) going via Madrid as they done do Lima direct. I felt comfortable selecting the Iberia flight knowing that the two airlines merged several years ago , and I assumed they would be quite similar in standard. Unfortunately that was not the case, Iberia is a vastly inferior service with lazy staff who treat passengers with disdain. We flew in Premium Economy(PE), something that IB has added to their aircraft around 18 months ago; we traveled on a Airbus 340-600. Boarding: the gate was absolute chaos - no signage to indicate where each class of travel should queue, and only 2 staff members to manage a crowd of 350 passengers. No priority given to people in wheelchairs or families traveling with push buggies etc. Onboard: the PE hard product looked good; Seats were standard premium economy and the bulkhead seat was spacious. The tv screens were modern, large with sharp picture quality. Unfortunately there were several coffee stains on the cabin walls and my footrest was broken. The crew: they were very lax. No cabin crew pointing out emergency exit, or any form of demo - just a pre recorded met. Throughout the 12 hour flight when ever the captain turned on the fasten seatbelt sign (5-6 times), the crew only made verbal announcements but no crew member actually came round to check that passengers were safely buckled up. When there was turbulence during meal service the crew would just carry on - even walking around with a hot pot of coffee serving passengers! The toilets were dirty all three times I used the facilities- no crew went in to tidy it at any point during the flight. The crew were literally just doing the bare essentials- well, not even. They were not particularly friendly either, no smiles no banter, just dropped the food on your tray table and moved to the next seat. Between meal service there were no crew to be seen. The food and beverages: the food in PE was economy food, as were the beverages (wine choice was “red or white”) and no spirits were served. No pre meal drinks service either. The food menu listed did not match the food being served. Summary: Iberia as a whole were extremely disappointing. The crews lack of adherence to standard air safety protocol is concerning. Iberia’s premium economy product was well below par and not worth what you pay for it. I was relieved when we landed, and thankful that our flight back to the UK from Buenos Aires is going to be on a British Airways aircraft.",A340-600,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Madrid to Lima,November 2018,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,1,no,True,Madrid,Lima,

Cabin comfort is awesome even though seat pitch is terrible. Although I picked seat 38L which is by far the best seat in economy. Overall I was very happy with the service I received even if it was minimal and basic. The highlight of flying with Iberia is Madrid-Barajas airport which is one of the most beautiful in the world. Being Sapphire on One World I was also able to use their gorgeous VIP lounge and take a shower before my flight from Madrid to Venice. The reception desk employees couldn't have been more disinterested however. Their inter-european flights are horrible however. It's run like a budget airline where you have to pay 2 Euros for water. That's pathetic. Also the A319 I flew both directions was ancient and dirty and shouldn't have been in service in that condition. The water in the forward cabin restroom didn't work and instead they had towelettes to wash your hands. That's not acceptable. The flight back from Madrid to JFK was comfortable however service was absolutely terrible. They advertise WiFi but I couldn't get it to work after being in the air and at cruising altitude for over an hour. When I asked the flight attendant she gruffly told me that they haven't turned it on yet and that ""Usted tiene que estar patiente"" as if she was scolding a 5 year old. I'm not sure why that was necessary. When the WiFi did work it was so slow as to be rendered unusable. During the flight there was a 5 hour stretch where they couldn't be bothered to come through the aisle to even offer water or juice. This was unacceptable. Also they used the excuse of turbulence. I finally got up and asked the flight attendant in the back if I could please have some water. He poured me a cup and when I handed him the glass back he rudely snapped at me in Spanish saying: ""Don't you see the seatbelt sign is on? You are supposed to be in your seat."" It was uncalled for and inexcusable. At the end of the day they used the turbulence excuse in order to sit in the back of the plane and chat. Later I tested them by pressing my FA call button. They never came to my seat. That's no good. Of course when the final meal before landing was being served we were flying through extremely rough turbulence. But it wasn't enough in that case to suspend service? My overall takeaway is I would avoid Iberia in the future and fly AA-BA codeshare flights in the future.

293,Oleg Martens,United States,2018-08-08,1,"My review concerns Iberia's and Vueling's behavior with regards to a flight I had to take from Brussels to Barcelona on 17th June 2018. As I was downloading my boarding pass on August 16th, I noticed that my flight time had been moved from a mid-afternoon to an early morning time. Further, I saw that my flight had been moved from the 17th to the 20th. Since I was heading to Barcelona for business, with presentations on the morning of the 18th, this change of schedule did not work for me. I called Iberia about the issue (since I booked my flight through Iberia's website), but was told I should talk to Vuelig since they operated the flight. I tried to reach Vueling, but never managed to reach a human. Showed up at Brussels airport first thing the next morning to try and speak to a representative, but the person manning the desk for both Iberia and Vueling told me she did not actually work for either company and could not help. Finally find out that all Vuelig flights have been cancelled due to French controller air strike. However, also find out that Brussels airlines has not cancelled its flights and so manage to book a last minute ticket with them. It's important to note that during all of this, not once was I notified by either Iberia or Vueling that my flight had been changed, and this despite the fact that both companies had my cell phone number and email address. Also, when I filed a complaint with Vueling, I was told it was an Iberia problem since I booked through Iberia. And when I filed a complaint with Iberia, I was told it was a Vueling problem because they operated the flight. three weeks into arguing with each airline, they both stated that under EU law, they are protected because the French strike was none of their doing. Neither company has taken any responsibility for the lack of communication (which I find very unprofessional), and neither has offered to compensate me for the new ticket I had to purchase + all of the unecessary stress they created by cancelling the flight and not offering me any reasonable options (3 days later is not a reasonable option for a business traveler). Overall, very disapointed and feel like neither company cares much about customers. I indicated as much to both companies and neither has cared to provide a response since telling me EU law allows them to bahave in such a manner. I have travelled all over the world over the last 35 years, and this is by far the worst customer service and ownership of responsibility I have ever experienced.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Madrid to Brussels,June 2018,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,,3,no,True,Madrid,Brussels,

My card expired last month and since I had already paid for the ticket and obviously I got rid off the old card. The man working at the ticket office at Iberia at Madrid airport was extremely rude and did not give a damn about helping me: I presented my email ticket showing proof of my purchase with my name on it. That was not enough. I presented to him a photo proof of my credit card proving that the card was indeed mine which he did not accept. I showed him the credit card bill with the Iberia charge showing that I had paid for the ticket and there was not fraud.  He told me that I could not get on the plane and he would not even let me cancel my existing reservation and pay for the same seat on the same plane again. I was told that the Iberia flights during the next two days were fully booked up so that he could not even make me another reservation for me on another day. I went online to see if that was true and there were seats available on both days. He told me that Iberia and Iberia Plus are two different companies and that he could not help me since part of my ticket was paid with my miles. He said he had nothing to do with my ticket reservation and gave me the phone number of Iberia miles so that they could fix the problem. He would not even call on my behalf to Iberia Plus given that I am not a native Spanish speaker. At Iberia Plus on the phone I was  told that they could not verify my card.

You can't expect much when booking a cheap fare but at least I am expecting a minimum standard of quality on every flight, no matter if I fly on a LCC or a premium airline. My first contact with the airline was at the checkin desk. I tried to purchase an upgrade but they said that it wasn't possible today. I was okay with that and went to the gate to ask if they can at least give me an empty row as the flight was very empty (I assume the load in Y was about 30-40%). The gate agent was very unsupportive and told me to search for a free seat once I'm in the plane. Eventually, after asking her a second time, I got my free row (an absolute standard request). On board, we were ""welcomed"" by the purser who seemed very uninterested in her job. The crew overall seemed not to like their job, except for some of the FAs (one of them was our ""service FA""). They barely speak any English (or just don't want to). The procedures were very unorganized and chaotic. The seat comfort was fine but there wasn't much leg space (not much of a problem thanks to the free neighbor seat). The blanket colored my black shirt so I had to change it afterward (luckily, I had just hand luggage and some shirts with me). I lifted the armrest and there was dust and lots of dirt. I looked up the plane and it had been delivered to IB in 2010. It appears that it has not been properly cleaned ever since (see the images). The food for dinner (Lasagne) was acceptable. The drink service was okay. Breakfast was delivered in boxes and a bit small but okay. I complaint to the airline about the cleanliness by an official form at MAD as well as via FB. The ground staff at MAD was very friendly and apologized for the inconvenient situation. I received a reply from the customer relations department the day after: “To ensure the utmost hygiene on every flight, the aircraft are always cleaned immediately after arrival at destination. However, air traffic control limitations and the length of the aircraft's stopover mean that occasionally we have to do this in less time. Please accept my apologies if the seat was not in perfect condition.""  Fast cleaning may not include the cleaning under the armrests but it should be normal to do it at least every other month. As my connection (A320) had dirt at the same place, IB seems to be cleaning their aircraft not very well. Wifi is very overpriced (about 5$ for 4MB). In short: The ground staff (an agent on behalf of IB) in SCL was bad, the crew not good (except for some of the members), food acceptable, cleanliness disastrous.

Their check in computers jumped to Spanish completely randomly, causing you to start all over again, until it completely crashed. There was no help to get from the Iberia staff on location and the solution was to check in manually. While waiting in line, the barriers were changed two times causing 50+ people to rearrange everything, with expected results. Almost at the end of the cue, a staff member pulls us and two other couples out of the cue, says something in Spanish and walks away.

We get there only to face the most unfriendly check in agent I have ever seen, who tell us that we have no checked luggage for the flight. When presented with the receipt for both flight and luggage, she claims that the receipt is invalid since it's from a third party, (Flight Network), and proceeds to charge us €70 extra. The other options would be to leave it behind, or not go on the flight we already paid for. At this point the atmosphere was not good to say the least. But a tiny plus was that she managed to assign to us seats on 3rd row. When we entered the plain we saw that this was behind the business class divider. The seats were a different color than the rest of the economy class seats, but otherwise the same shape and size so I thought nothing of it, until a stewardess came and asked us to relocate as she needed those seats for someone else. I tried to explain that we had been assigned those seats for the discomfort of the check in errors.

I had asked the ticket agency and they had said not to worry they will put us on the next flight. When we arrived in Madrid, we still had about an hour. The customs lines were long and we asked Iberia for help, they said get back to the line. Needless to us we missed the connecting flight. When we went to the agent to book the next flight, they asked us to pay - we had to ask for a supervisor to clear that it was their fault for delaying. On the next flight they could only take two people from our party with the suitcase. They didn't take the suitcase. They put us on priority waitlist for the next flight.  Needless to say they assigned us to an 8 o'clock flight. Once we were boarding, they took us off and said the flight was cancelled.

Flew from Santiago de Compostela on Iberia Express to Madrid yesterday to connect to our Iberia flight to New York. I can see why Iberia Express gets its 'most punctual airline' reputation. Boarding was swift, very organized and we departed about 5mins ahead of schedule. On board, sadly there wasn't much to say except the legroom was very tight and even a coffee had to be paid for. The crew seemed pleasant and helpful. I was however, not able to connect to the advertised free streaming entertainment at all. Not a huge deal breaker as it was a short flight. I had decided to take up an email offer to upgrade my next sector to New York and was so glad I did. Having priority boarding as a part of it was a huge plus on this maxed out A340-600. I loved the Premium Economy seat with the extra recline and legroom was great. It's a fresh, relatively small, more private cabin than the wild expanse of regular economy. The larger, responsive, IFE screen worked well and had just enough options to keep me occupied for 7 hours. The very slightly upgraded meal (main served in a china dish) was fairly decent thought it took quite a while after take off before it was served. There was no bar service before this. The crew were warm and pleasant though and seemed to be constantly working. We sat in row 15 which is only slightly ahead of the galley, so could hear everything and the light from the galley was distracting at times. The pre-arrival snack of a boxed sandwich was fine and we arrived only slightly late into JFK. All in all, I'd recommend Iberia's Premium Economy if you do get an email offer to upgrade.

The day after - I arrived at the airport to find the desk closed, and the Info help desk tried in vain to help us call the number stated in the directory. No answer.

I asked them to send my baggage to Cusco where I was - call centre people said ""yes, we will leave a message for the airline to do so"". But every day i called up the luggage would still be in Lima and the call centre people kept saying ""yes we will leave the message"".

When I arrived at the airport in Seville, I was informed that my ticket was no longer valid and that I would need to repurchase a new ticket. Iberia did not contact me to inform me prior to my arrival at the airport, despite the fact that a week had passed since my flight from Chicago to Madrid. In fact, two days before my return flight, I received an e-mail from Iberia titled ""Comunicación operativa: Información sobre su vuelo"" (Flight Information). This e-mail gave no indication that my flights had been cancelled. I ended up buying a ticket on the same flights as my original booking - Iberia did not refund my money for the flights they  cancelled. I submitted a complaint through Iberia's website on November 28th in which I requested a refund for the flights they cancelled. I received this response on December 22nd: ""Certain fares do not accept refund and have a number of limitations with regard to changes in the route or sequence of reserved routes. For this reason, if the journey does not start, our system automatically cancels the ticket and if any of the purchased journeys is not used, the remaining routes included in the ticket will be cancelled. This is what happened in your case."" I have no complaints about Iberia's flight attendants or in-flight service, but the fact that they cancelled my return flights, didn't inform me and won't refund my money does not strike me as good business.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Seville via Madrid,November 2017,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1,no,True,Chicago,Seville,Madrid

Iberia offered frequent beverage service that included good wines. Only their coffee was lacking (I wondered if they use robusta rather than arabica coffee) Our main meals were some of the best we have ever had in business class.

Upon checking in (also done on Iberia website) we got a boarding passes marked as LEVEL airline (never heard of it before) with a huge mark no baggage. So we had to purchase additional baggage for 3 people, but we were not aware that there is also no meals included on a 10hr flight! Looked at an electronic ticket from Iberia and it clearly marked meal included (as Nr 3, No preference). Check-in agent was very attentive and said he can try to do whatever but that he has tons of cases like that where people are deceived into flying with Iberia but then they put them on a Level flight, with no luggage and meals! He said it happens every day! As meals were clearly marked on the ticket we kindly asked if we can talk to Iberia customer service regarding this. And that is when we were outraged by their customer service. He looked into the system and just waved at us that there is nothing he can do. When presenting their ticket with meals clearly marked for both flights and the inbound flight even stating “operated by Iberia”, he said that is a mistake on the ticket (their ticket!) and there is nothing he can do. The LEVEL flight experience was very bad. The plane is cramped, staff very unpolite, no blankets and pillows are offered.

Boarding was via a rather remote part of the airport and I noted some elderly people struggling with steep stairs to reach the boarding area. As I boarded a flight a male flight attendant coughed in my face twice and made no apology. The crew with one exception were absent during the flight. What alarmed me was the robotic and insincere attempt to have a security talk. I was not impressed. Food had to be purchased and was not of a good quality at all. I was very disappointed.

LHR-MAD flight was mediocre and the attitude of the crew left a lot to be desired, particularly their attitude to safety. MAD-VLC was delayed by 30 minutes with no information given (at one point, gate stuff packed up and left) which meant we arrived too late for our car hire.

I resorted to changing my return flight from Almeria to Madrid because of the final time change. I also then had to change my ongoing train from the UK airport to home because of the time factor. When I arrived at Heathrow, the BA check-in assistant said there was not enough time between my Heathrow to Madrid and Madrid to Almeria flights for my luggage to be transferred. She said Iberia are always doing this. Her superior told her that the luggage could only be booked to Madrid and that I would have to sort the problem out there. Iberia do not have a desk at Heathrow. The assistant printed out boarding cards for both outgoing flights. I would have to collect my luggage at Madrid and check it in again. At the boarding gate an assistant checked my details and insisted that I’d booked the flights separately. I disagreed. I later checked this online: I had one booking reference; therefore I had not booked them separately. Iberia never acknowledged this. I spoke to a flight attendant on-board. He said this had not happened before. He said that the assistant at check-in should have booked my luggage to go all the way to Almeria. He said ‘BA are always doing this’, contradicting his earlier comment. A Heathrow member of staff said she would make a note of what had happened. On landing at Madrid, I ran to Enquiries to be told to go straight to the gate and make a claim for the luggage at Almeria. No one had told me this previously. I am 61 years old and had to run the length of the airport to board my plane by the skin of my teeth. On arriving at Almeria, I made my claim. Again I was told my luggage should have been booked right through! I eventually got my luggage the next evening. In a reply to my email to Iberia, they asked for various details as if I was making a claim for 'lost' luggage. Iberia also gave me some platitudes regarding airport policies on change of flight times. They had misunderstood some of the main points of my email: to make Iberia aware of the complete shambles of booking my flights, particularly with not enough time allocated between connecting flights and little or no coordination with BA, whom I dealt with during check in at Heathrow. In their last email to me, Iberia said 'As long as you have confirmed connecting tickets which comply with the minimum times we can usually offer you the possibility of getting your boarding cards and checking in your luggage through to the final destination'. When I booked the tickets for my flight, I expected Iberia to confirm 'connecting tickets which comply with the minimum times'. They indicated that the onus was on me. I strongly disagree. In fact, I spoke at length with BA Customer Services who said that if I tried to book a flight online with them, their website would not permit such a booking with such a short connecting time between flights! I feel that they tried to fob me off by deflecting my criticisms and complaints.

371,Charles Atienza,Philippines,2017-04-20,1,"✅ Verified Review   Ibiza to Madrid via Valencia. April 17, 2017, at 4:30 PM our chauffeur service from the hotel took us to Ibiza Airport. We got to the airport at 4:45pm and went to the Iberia's One World/Business Class check-in counter for us to get on the flight to Madrid via IB 8027. We told the staff that we have a subsequent connection to Manila via Doha from Madrid. For some bizarre twist of fate, we were placed on waitlist despite having confirmed seats. We were told that since we have a Ruby Status on OneWorld, we would get prioritized as the flight was overbooked and that there will be passengers who would not show up. After security checks clearance, we read on the flight info monitor where our boarding gate was. We whiled away the time at the lounge and at the same time, checking if the boarding commenced, until it started at 5:40pm. Boarding was late by 10 minutes. So we had to approach the check in staff of Iberia and informed her of the situation. She just nonchalantly made us wait on the side until boarding was done. When the last passenger came, we approached her again only to be told that the we could not be accommodated on the flight despite having international connection to Manila via Doha on Qatar Airways (Business Class). We were then instructed to go back to the check in counter in order for them to resolve our case. We were not even guided or escorted on how we were supposed to get back considering all our bags were checked. So off we went. When we reached the counter, the Supervisor was there. She placed us on a flight IB 8437 to Valencia and subsequently on IB 8027 from Valencia to Madrid. She asked where our luggage where and we told her that they were checked in. She said you have to get it from the belt. So my partner had to run back to the arrival area and make his way inside the luggage carousel to get the backs to be re-checked in. I then asked her if we'll make it in time for our flight. She only answered by telling us that we would be arriving in Madrid at 10pm and that we'll have to get our bags and run to Qatar Airways' check in counter. We were told also to show our null boarding pass from Ibiza-Madrid either in Valencia or Madrid in order to get compensated from being bumped off. We were left with no choice but to take it as there were no other options. When we get to the boarding gate for our flight to Valencia, we noticed that our boarding passes for the Valencia-Madrid leg bore the same name (Atienza) although with different seat assignments. We again approached the same Iberia boarding staff regarding this and told us to inform Iberia boarding staff that it was their fault and that we should be let on the flight. We took the flight IB 8437 operated by Air Nostrum to Valencia which took 35 minutes. We deplaned and went to the boarding gate for our Valencia-Madrid leg on IB 8027 and begged for the staff their to get in touch with Qatar Airways as it was not our fault to get bumped off and for them to wait for us since we were flying in Business Class. All we got was the staff's word that she would call but whether or not she did, there was no way for us to know. We were also given a proof for us to get compensated for being bumped off our Ibiza to Madrid flight indicating a minimum compensation of €125/passenger. IB 8027 flight was delayed. It was totally a race against time. We boarded the flight and touched down half past 9pm.

375,L Pearce,United States,2017-03-16,3,"✅ Verified Review   While Iberia is known to deliver a decent, if not stellar, service in Business Class (with the exception of the shameful Iberia Express brand which should be all Economy), there is a very serious problem with its checking agents in Paris Orly (Iberia Staff? Vueling? IAG? Outside contractor?) who possibly deliver the worst service in the Industry. These agents are quite brazen about doing as little as possible with the worst professional attitude, and they seem completely unsupervised. The Iberia rule is to open check-in 2.30 hours before departure time. Check-in seldom opens more than 2 hours ahead of time, with no agent to be seen before. It creates long lines including in the Priority line where the criteria is not enforced. This invariably results in chaos and altercations, handled by the staff in a tone more adaptd to women guards in female prisons. If in addition the check in banks stop rolling and accepting checked bags (frequent and not Iberia's fault), they continue accepting passengers, printing tags and leaving them loose for future attachment to heaps of baggage just left there, which must result in horribly misdirected luggage in large quantities. In other words, these agents need supervision, and training both in operations and addressing passengers. Obviously they get none whatsoever.

It started with a very good experience in the British Airways business Lounge as this was a code share flight. We flew after 8 PM from Gatwick to Madrid and after changing terminaI was able to go in the Iberia business Lounge which was deserted and use a bed in the relaxing area and successfully slept all night. Woke and havd a complimentary shower and shave and then a good breakfast before my flight from Madrid to Bogotá at noon. The business class seats all laid out very well and all seats are accessible without clambering over any other people. There are various airlines that if you get stuck by the window or in the middle and the other person puts their bed down then you've got no choice but to try and climb across them. All very poor but certainly not with Iberia. The staff attention was good and so were the meals. It seems that the Spanish still take the service sector as a career rather than a reluctant top up job like they might in the UK. There are still a sense of pride by working with an airline. On the return sector everything was equally as good and I think I slept for nearly 8 hours. I really didn't want to get off the plane.

The temperature onboard was far too warm - maybe a trick by the crew to push the inflight-sale of drinks? On the positive side, the flight was full and the crew happily helped me to find a space for my cabin luggage as I was among the last passengers to board. Another big plus was the fact that the aircraft was pushed back from the stand on the clock and touched down in Barajas 20 minutes before schedulded arrival. The second leg to Palma on Iberia Express, a couple of hours later, was a much better experience. The aircraft interior looked clean and fresh and so did the cheerful all-female cabin crew.

Although a shorter flight than usual for this aircraft full IFE was working with a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows available, although this was switched off 15 minutes before landing for some reason. All shorter flights no longer offer even a complimentary drink, never mind a snack.

We were not able to travel on this booking and required assistance from Iberia Customer Services. This was possibly one of the most painful experiences I have ever had. Initially I attempted to cancel the flights via telephone. They were non-refundable so all I was asking for was an email to confirm that the booking had been cancelled and that we were not eligible for a refund. Iberia were unable to do this. Subsequently I attempted to contact the airline by email (for a written record this time). Again, all I was asking for was an email stating that we did not use the flights and that the booking was non-refundable. Four months later, I have managed to at last get the required document from Iberia. By way of comparison, and despite having booked through Iberia, one of the flights was a BA code share. Iberia said that we would have to go to BA for proof that we did not board that flight. One form on the BA website and one week later, BA had provided the email.

For 6 days this went on my luggage wasn't lost it was just sitting at the Miami airport. Anyway, when they finally got it, I only found out about it because I called for like the 30th time. Even though I had an online account for ""lost luggage"" per their prompting they couldn't even keep that up to date. Then, when my luggage arrived at the Barcelona airport, I found out that they wanted me to come pick it up as opposed to the instructions for delivery on my account - the website account was not updated. Now, 3 WEEKS later, exactly 22 days after I filed a claim for reimbursement of my expenses I incurred for not having my luggage for 6 days, I'm told that the request is finally being processed, even though early on they had told me the max length of time for reimbursement was 21 days after filing. Not once did they initiate contact (no email nothing) or info or instructions. Even to this day 3 weeks later, my ""lost luggage"" account on Iberia's website states ""delivering pending"". I picked it up at the Barcelona airport 3 weeks ago!",,Business,Economy Class,MIA to BCN via MAD,October 2016,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1,no,False,MIA,BCN,MAD
392,William Wood,United States,2016-11-22,3,"✅ Verified Review  This was a leg of a One World Round-The-World Business Class Fare, so I had no choice, but to take this overnight flight between Madrid and Moscow. The first thing to point out is that the business class on this flight is just the renamed First Class Cabin from 15 years ago. The seats were the wider, but limited reclining type that you found on international flights 15 years ago. The entertainment system was more nostalgia with a small screen that was stored in the armrest and looping movies for the duration of the flight. The service was very pleasant, attentive and friendly with a variety of languages including English, Russian and Spanish. Overall, if this were a 5 hour day flight, it would have mitigated the impact of the antiquated seats and poor entertainment (who these days is not with some device to keep them busy for a couple of hours). Given the flight left at mid-night, one would have expected amenities more toward the red-eye flyer.",A319,Business,Business Class,MAD to DME,September 2016,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,,2,no,False,MAD,DME,
393,E García,Spain,2016-11-21,10,"✅ Verified Review  Took the Air Shuttle (Puente Aéreo) between Barcelona and Madrid to go and come back in the same day. Check-in can be done up to 20 minutes before flight departure and the flight is about 50 minutes, which makes it really quick to get to Madrid and come back in the same day. The price is not cheap, but the total flexibility is worth it and being able to take which ever flight you want is great. Puente Aéreo is much faster than the high speed train and makes it easier to go and come back on the same day. I really recommend this service for passengers flying for business purposes.",A321,Business,Economy Class,BCN to MAD,November 2016,5.0,4.0,,3.0,5.0,,4,yes,False,BCN,MAD,
394,Michael Haugh,United Kingdom,2016-11-20,7,Treated ourselves to Business Class flying from Madrid to Havana return. It was a very enjoyable flight both ways. The flat seats were great for the overnight flight on the way back. The cabin crew were attentive but not in your face. The plane appeared relatively new. The only downside was that as an English speaker found the crew and captain hard to understand but only a minor irritation.,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,MAD to HAV,October 2016,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes,False,MAD,HAV,
395,H Tennant,Germany,2016-11-15,1,"✅ Verified Review  Tokyo Narita to Dusseldorf via Madrid with Iberia. Probably the worst experience I've ever had when it comes to traveling by plane. Long before we were supposed to even fly, our seat reservation was constantly changed without any notice. When we wanted to check in online, our newly assigned seats were distributed all over. We finally got seats together for the first leg from NRT to MAD. However, the ground staff failed to assign seats next to each other from MAD-DUS. We were supposed to sit in Row 9 and 16 (fortunately we were able to change the seats in MAD). Departure was on time and shortly after we were airborne, lunch service had started. However, the service was very stressed and the cabin attendants did not seem to be very coordinated. The staff seemed more focused on getting everything done as fast as possible. During the coffee service, the flight attendant was literally running through the aisle, I could not even get my cup raised quickly enough to get some coffee. Upon request, the unfriendly cabin attendant grunted ""not now, maybe later"". Only after I asked another cabin attendant who was slightly more friendly I got my coffee which was cold by then. In general, the service was unfriendly. Adressing all passengers in Spanish, although it was very obvious, they were not speaking Spanish. They were also replying in Spanish, after I had adressed them in English. The food itself was awful. The noodles were overcooked and the meat was very chewy. Shortly after lunch service the cabin light was switched off and we were asked to close the window blinds leaving us in the dark on a daytime flight. After that, the crew completely disappeared and only appeared again for a quick snack service and the pre-arrival meal. As we were flying in one of their brand new A330-200 models from Tokyo, the inflight entertainment system was, hardware wise, state of the art. However, the movie and TV-series selection was rather poor. The 3D, interactive flight map, however was great. The connecting flight from Madrid to Düsseldorf held another unpleasant surprise. When we boarded the aircraft, the aircraft was extremely dirty. French Fries were all over the place and when I asked the flight attendant why it was so dirty, she replied ""there were kids sitting there and the company doesn't pay for cleaning until the airplane will be back in Madrid"". Luckily we were able to have our seats changed and got some seats which were cleaner.",A330-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,NRT to DUS via MAD,November 2016,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,,2,no,False,NRT,DUS,MAD
396,Beverly Antoniou,United Kingdom,2016-11-02,3,"Flew Iberia from London Heathrow to Havana via Madrid. Positive - the flight was on time and check in was very smooth. Negative - the food was atrocious, had some beef dish and I imagine eating my shoe would have been preferable. The meal was the only one served during a 10 hour flight except for a disgusting breakfast, which was practically thrown in our face. Tried to get a drink of water during the flight but wasn't supplied, I assume the cabin staff were sleeping. I wouldn't use this airline again as these inconveniences are okay on a short haul, but not on a longer flight.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to HAV via MAD,November 2016,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2,no,False,LHR,HAV,MAD
397,Gaspard Smith-Vaniz,France,2016-11-02,7,"I flew from Lyon to Rio De Janeiro via Madrid in Mid-October. Boarding and ground staff were nice, exept at the check-in couter, where the lady was rude and unwelcoming. Our LYS-MAD flight was what you would expect for a short hop, but I was disapointed with the fact that you had to pay for food or drinks. MAD to GIG was a rather long flight (10 hours and a half) and the flight cew provided A good service. The food was correct (although I have tasted better ones on other airlines). IFE was good, with personal touch screens with games, plenty of music and some 50 movies/series. They did not lose my luggage, which was ""surprising"" since I had a very short connection. Compared to the price I paid, I would consider the service great. It is a good airline if you want to fly to South America at low prices with reasonable comfort.","CRJ-1000, A340-600",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LYS to GIG via MAD,October 2016,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,,4,yes,False,LYS,GIG,MAD

Still the fast track takes a bit longer than expected. Around 25min. Lounge great. Boarding and departure on time. Priority boarding provided. FA very nice and service provided on board was very good. Window seat privacy and confort is great. Food selection and wines are better than competitors. Amenity kit with L'Occitane products.

399,Catalin-Alexandru Epure,Germany,2016-10-29,7,"I booked this flight from Milan Malpensa to Cancun via Madrid through their website and the first thing happened was that they have booked the flight twice and charged my credit card accordingly. After calling their call center I was able to get the money back, but in more then a week, and we are not talking 100€ here. The big surprise was when I arrived in Milan at the airport. Online when checking in I couldn't give my frequent flyer number so I said I will do everything at the airport. The lady at the priority check in very rudely tells me that my reservation has been cancelled and she asks me to go and provide her a valid reservation number looking very busy, although there was no client anywhere. So I call Iberia again, after 8 minutes waiting in line they tell me that everything has been resolved and I should go to the check in desk again. I go this time to the normal check in desk and there is another lady, same style. She says my flight is in 3h30m and I should get back in 1h30m otherwise she can't check in the bags. I didn't need any bags, I just wanted my boarding card, so she has to somehow leave her ""doing nothing"" and she issues the tickets. I should say I have told her to insert my FF number before issuing the tickets, 3 times, without any success. She first issued the boarding passes and then at the end my card number. This caused me a lot of problems, first at the business lounge in Milan where they couldn't read my oneworld status. In Madrid I found out that the FF number inserted was wrong (a 7 too much) and while trying to fix this, they've told me the system is not working and that they will fix it later. when it was fixed, it was in Madrid when returning and they have given me the right number just for the last part MAD MXP, for all the other legs I should contact them via internet. I was pretty sure I will get my miles 3 months after this, but it turned out to be different. I got them a week after I returned home. Now, about the flights. The planes were new and the A340-600 was impressive. 2-4-2 configuration. The crew very attentive and friendly, active at customer's needs. The food wasn't great (only one meal for 13h) and the breakfast was a joke: a box with different cold snacks. I must say I was impressed by the punctuality. Arrived on time or even 30 min ahead of schedule. So thumbs up for the flights, thumbs down for the ground service. Overall they did a good job and I would fly them again (booked already for next year).",A340-600,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MXP to CUN via MAD,October 2016,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,,5,yes,False,MXP,CUN,MAD
