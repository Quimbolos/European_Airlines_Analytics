0,J House,United States,2023-11-02,2,"My wife and I paid a great deal to fly Premium Economy on Iberia. The only aspect of the flight that was worth the extra fee was the seat. We were able to reline and sleep during the flight. However, all the other amenities were poor. First, my wife and I have TSA Pre, but Iberia does not pay the TSA fee, so we had to go through the 'regular' line. Our seats were between Business and Economy. We could hear and smell the crew preparing the meals for Business, but our food came after economy had been served their dinner. We were not allowed to use the nearby Business class toilets but instead go to the end of the aircraft (passing all economy seats) to use the toilet. Before we arrived at our destination in the morning, we received our breakfast, which was a box with a small roll and a juice/fruit container with no spoon with which to eat it. After we had eaten, they came around with a thermos container of coffee which was poured halfway into a paper cup. This was not the premium economy for which we had paid!

11,R Palmer,Mexico,2023-08-04,1,"I received the worst possible treatment from a flight attendant. On that flight I paid additionally for seats near my husband and son. When boarding the plane I found my seat occupied by a person. The flight attendant gave it to him and he didn't want to change it. She told me to sit somewhere else and I explained that I had paid for them and that it was important to be close to my children for personal reasons. Still, she insisted that the man was taking my place to be close to some teenagers (note that there was a space available between the teens and in the middle section Right next to it, so I don't understand the need to take my place when there are more spaces available and appropriate for the care of people in their late teens). I did not accept giving up my place and the flight attendant cursed me saying that I am inflexible and that life was going to give it back to me and that she hoped everyone is inflexible with me (in front of all the passengers) which was insuring and made my daughter cry and made us have a very difficult, awkward and unpleasant trip. I filed a complaint of which there was only an acknowledgment of receipt by the airline and they never communicated anything to me again, closing the file without any notification or report. The plane has very small spaces, it is uncomfortable and the dining table cannot be extended or placed. It was very Unfortunate what happened.

12,Vicente Russo,United States,2023-08-01,1,"I booked an economy ticket LAX-Madrid and paid for exit row seats on both flights. At the airport, I was informed that my paid seats were taken, even though I had a confirmed seats email from Iberia. On the outbound flight, they put us on the plane's last row (from my booked and paid row 23). After we sat, other passengers came claiming the same seats and we had to be separated and moved to middle seats. On the returning flight, I confirmed the seats over the phone the day before the flight and still, they separated us and assigned us in middle seats. During check-in, the agent lied saying that they had changed the aircraft (not true) and that I had allocated seats but not confirmed seats - when I showed her the email from Iberia showing confirmed seats, she became hostile. During the 12 hours flight, the entertainment service and Wi-Fi crashed. I applied for a refund for the almost $400 I paid for the exit row seats and Iberia refused to refund me. The whole situation is so absurd that it is almost unbelievable that an airline can be this callous. Customer service was unhelpful and condescending.

The ground crew could not attach the gate to the door and it kept passengers on the plane for over an hour, enough to cause many passengers, including me to miss their next flights.

16,P Halera,United States,2023-07-12,1,"We booked a flight from Madrid to Los Angeles with American Airlines, from MAD to London Heathrow with IB, and from there a flight to LAX with AA. We only had 90 minutes to catch the connecting flight, so when our IB flight was delayed for over 2 hours, we knew that we weren't going to make our connecting flight. I spoke with an IB employee while we were still in Madrid, and asked them if we should still fly to LHR since we're missing the connecting flight (or at the very least, start making accommodations for an alternate connecting flight). The IB employee said that there's nothing they can do at MAD, so we should take the flight to LHR and that they would figure it out once we arrive to London. We arrive at London 3 hours late (2 hrs from the delay at MAD, and another hour at the gate at LHR because the door was jammed and they couldn't get it open). Once we finally got out, there were no IB employees at LHR (they leave at 8pm), so we went to AA's customer service. Well, AA can't help us because it's IB who was delayed. Only problem is that all IB employees are gone for the night (they won't return until 6am), and their 24-hour customer service is trash. The IB customer service reps that I spoke with said that since I bought the tickets from AA, that it's AA and not IB who have to book me a new flight home. After 4 different phone calls totalling 90+ minutes on the phone, IB was able to book us a flight to Paris, and from Paris take a 13-hour flight to LAX.  Also, not once did they mention that we can get a hotel for the night and that they would have to reimburse us. However, we know our rights as airline passengers, and when I mentioned this, the IB reps were vague as to how I can get reimbursed, or what my allowance was.

18,Miguel Perez,Mexico,2023-07-07,1,"Without a doubt, this has been the worst flight experience I have ever had. On April 5th, my wife and I traveled from Mexico City to Madrid (Flight IB 6402). Upon arriving at Barajas Airport, we proceeded to the baggage claim area, and after waiting for approximately an hour and a half, we went to the Iberia counter to file a complaint. The airline provided us with a receipt that had no logo or much information that could identify them. It should be noted that none of the passengers on this flight received their luggage, so the airline should easily identify what happened. The luggage was finally delivered on the eve of our departure to Rome, which means that we spent our entire stay in Madrid without our luggage. Upon my return to Mexico City, I initiated the process of filing a complaint regarding the inconveniences caused by this airline, and initially, Iberia showed a willingness to provide a refund. They requested my bank account information and copies of the expenses incurred.

19,B Kemp,United States,2023-06-20,1,"My wife and I had spent 8 months planning a trip for our family of five. We had flight confirmation for all of us with American Airlines and were flying out of Boston to Barcelona with Iberia which was part of the booking. When we arrived in Boston for our flights to Barcelona, we were told by the Iberia agent that four of our family members had boarding passes but one of our daughters did not have a confirmed pass. I showed the agent the emails I had received stating that all members of our family had been confirmed for the flight with American Airlines (through Iberia). We had flown to Boston from Indianapolis so I was able to show the Iberia agent our luggage tags for all five of our family members showing that we had confirmed flights for everyone from Indy to Barcelona with a layover in Boston. The agent searched and again said that she didn't have any record of our daughter being confirmed for the flight to Barcelona and was told that we needed to go to the American Airlines counter to discuss. We had already spent about 45 minutes with the Iberia agent at this point. The check-in counter for American was 1 mile from the Iberia counter and there were no shuttles available at that time to take us to the other terminal. All five family members ran from Iberia to AA (15 minutes) only to find out that there were no agents at the AA counter. It was now about 1.5 hours before our flight was to leave. So we ran back to the Iberia counter and told them there was nobody at the AA counter. I asked them to look again to see why they weren't seeing my daughter's boarding pass and how would it be possible for us to have all of our luggage for all five passengers from Indy to Barcelona approved on the initial check-in if we all did not have boarding passes. I asked if they could check to see if there was room on the flight to add my daughter because at that point I was desperate to get her on the flight and was willing to pay the money to make that happen. The agent said that ""Yes, there is room on the flight"" but that we need to book the flight with American. At this point, we had spent an additional 30 minutes arguing with them and it was getting close to the time that they were shutting the doors for the flight. Another Iberia agent was calling American for us and we were told that there was now someone waiting for us at American Airlines counter at the other terminal. We ran back again to the American Airlines counter and talked with an agent who, within three minutes, pulled up the information showing - Here is my flight information with all five family members showing each was ""ticketed"" and confirmed for all of the flights.

I asked him at least 3 times before ending the call if there was anything else that I needed and he assured me that the email I had received with my booking number was sufficient. Fast forward to the day before my flight (today). I went to check-in and I was unable to do so online. I thought this was strange so called the airline directly and was told that my credit card information must not have gone through.

27,Martin Hong,United States,2023-05-06,1,"I had booked flights under different companies, the one that traveled from Erie to Boston was American Airlines, and the one that travels from Boston to Venice was under Iberia. The airline that arrived in Boston was a bit delayed so I rushed over to check in for the trip.  The attendants at the podium for boarding asked for completely useless information while withholding boarding passes. They asked for the return trip of when I return to the United States and the names under the booking which I provided fully. I attempted to show the record locator multiple times to which I was shut down and ignored. Eventually after 30 minutes of bickering, after I provided all information required of me and explained how I had multiple layovers, they told me that the flight was completely booked and that the seats were full. I had purchased the ticket in February for a seat, there was absolutely no way that the flight was full. I was denied boarding passes and ultimately entry to the flight.

28,B Andrews,United States,2023-05-04,3,"I booked a business class ticket with Iberia for a holiday trip to my home country. At first, I was overjoyed to find such a good deal. However, my joy quickly turned to frustration when I discovered that I had been double charged for the same flight. I contacted Iberia, and they claimed it was a mistake from their end. Despite this, fixing the issue proved to be a daunting task. Every time I called them, I received different responses, and the problem persisted. Eventually, I contacted my bank to dispute the transaction, and only then did Iberia respond. They canceled both of my tickets, even though the mistake was theirs. They claimed both charges were legitimate, despite providing proof that the tickets were suspended. After making numerous phone calls to Iberia, I was told that the flight might be canceled. However, if I did not ask, I would not have received a refund. I was also informed that the two tickets were valid and non-refundable, which was not the case. It is unacceptable for a large airline like Iberia to charge a customer for two non-existent tickets. To make matters worse, I am still waiting for a resolution to my problem. It has been a never-ending cycle of claims, phone calls, and false promises. I was originally supposed to receive an email about my claim, but after a week and four phone calls, I was informed that Iberia does not send emails about claims.

The boarding process was chaotic - everyone lined up in the jetway and then delayed as wheelchairs were wheeled slowly past us. My outbound experience with being unable to reserve a seat (the American codeshare should have entitled me to American premium economy options which Iberia ignores and wants to charge for) was repeated. Fortunately I arrived at the airport so early that I was given an aisle. As I had waited for boarding, I heard from several other travelers who had booked directly on Iberia in coach and premium economy with the same seat selection complaints and even worse: they had been assigned seats well before but were changed at the airport for no reason, even having paid the assignment fee. The food from Madrid was just as bad as from Boston. My choices were beef and pasta. I was seated in the second row of premium economy and there was only pasta after the first row of 7 people had made selections. The pasta contained some pasta and a wilted indeterminate vegetable with sauce, lots of sauce. The end-of-flight snack was equally poor - a soft roll with pressed white something in it, probably turkey but certainly not Serrano or Iberico ham.

When I arrived in Bogota, I waited for my suitcase, and after seeing it was not coming, I went to their counter. Their representative told me my suitcase did not board the plane in Madrid due to lack of space and he guaranteed that it would arrive at the address I will provide them. I told them that my final destination was going to be in another city, and the representative promised they would deliver it to the address that I'm providing them. I should note that beyond that, they didn't give me any information about what to do during this time, and they didn't provide me with essential hygienic equipment to get by until my suitcase arrived. They only promised the suitcase would arrive at my house in 3 days. When I got home, I realized that I needed to purchase underwear, shoes, and basic hygiene products at this time in order to have something to wear, and I didn't know how much they covered. The next day I called customer service. I waited a long time in line until their representative answered me. I explained the situation to her, and when I asked her what the amount of expenses they participate in, and she literally told me the following thing: ""I don't know what to tell you. You can Google it."" The next day I called again because it had already been three days and my suitcase still hadn't arrived as promised. I got another agent, and she didn't know what to say either.

You will be treated with arrogance, indifference, hostility and then denied boarding while some lackey on a power trip asks the captain of the plane if you're allowed to board.

58,Hagen Kellermann,Germany,2022-10-05,1,"Munich to Talara via Madrid, Lima. I flew with Iberia from Munich via Madrid and Lima to Talara (Peru). The last stint was operated by Latam. The flights itself were fine and on time, the food was decent, there could have been more service during the long haul flight. The customer service however is an absolute nightmare. It started with their agent at Munich airport. He assured me multiple times during the checking that my bags were checked all the way to Talara and as proof gave me the bag tags with destination “TY”. I asked multiple times whether I had to take out the bags in Lima to clear customs and he declined. In Talara my bags weren’t there. I filed the form with the staff at the small local airport and ever since (3 days now) am waiting for my bags. Since Latam operated the last flight it is their responsibility to retrieve the luggage according to Iberia. That has been their standpoint during all calls I made. Latam however says they are only retrieving the bags out of curtesy since they were supposed to clear customs in Lima - hence not their fault that they weren’t on the flight. After I saw Talara airport I was sure that the information given to me in Munich was false. Talara is a small domestic airport with no customs. If international baggage could be checked all the way here smuggling would be super easy. I still have no idea how this fact was not known by the agent in Munich. As a customer you feel helplessly lost between two companies which both blame each other for being responsible. I would have expected more from Iberia's customer service than stubbornly repeating that it is Latam's responsibility. Especially since right now the baggage seems to be stuck in Lima with Iberia and the Talara airport stuff says that there are problems receiving the luggage from them for transport. In summary: fly with them but triple check any information their agents give you - it might be plainly false and you have no proof or anything if you simply rely on their spoken advice. Funny sidenote: only after the third call to their customer service they admitted the baggage should have been retrieved in Lima.

I told her we had a 40 minute transfer in Madrid and that I was worried our bags would not come with us. She assured me they would, now we are in Croatia and have been waiting 3 days for our bags.

64,Nancy Jimenez Mota ,United States,2022-08-16,1,"Where to begin, I guess at the beginning. At check-in their computers were down, so it took a long time to check our luggage in and get boarding passes. Very unhelpful and not service oriented - I pulled up the health screener of my final destination, TLV, but it was not in a format they wanted so they said I would not fly if I couldn't pull it up. 3. Poor customer service. My seats from Madrid to TLV could not be assigned in DFW because they have subcontracted employees without full rights. Our first flight from DFW to Madrid got delayed, which is not a huge deal, but it got delayed even further because they could not match the passenger list with the amount of people on board. The flight crew could not understand the delay either, which they expressed to the passengers. Madrid to TLV was ok. TLV to Madrid 8/12 flight got moved up, I had to change my itinerary, customer service number would hang up on me. I could not find Iberia employees at the airport. Flight delayed and unprofessional - We were told the computers were down, they used a different airplane, and that we could sit anywhere. Then the ""musical chairs game began."" They started moving passengers left and right to balance the plane, just during take off and landing, then we could go back to our seats. The crew looked confused and dumb, like they didn't know what they were doing (because they didn't). Uncaring and very poor customer service - At Madrid they would not even consider putting me in an earlier flight, after disrupting my schedule, that was operated by AA on Iberia’s behalf because according to the Iberia agent: “They won’t give money to AA for taking you back.” At my arrival in DFW my luggage never arrived, despite being there way early, and the agent they had was again a subcontracted employee without access to their system, very young and untrained. He provided me with a handwritten form to fill out, no reference number was given to me. I did that and left because I was exhausted. 9a. Went to the airport the next day, Iberia’s counter was nowhere to be found, no employee available, nothing, just a ghost airline! The next day I call customer service and they could not help because their system was down, I proceed to explain my ordeal and worries about this flawed system and she replies - “I don’t control what happens at the airport and then cut off the call and sent me to a survey. Second CS call - She had said to call customer service back in 2 hours. I called customer service in 3 hours and the agent located the luggage in Madrid. I asked her to open a formal claim for my luggage, she said she couldn’t do that through her system. I exclaimed - “Then what are my options? I couldn’t do it at the airport, and I can’t do it now either.” She recommended for me to go to their website and fill out my complaint. Third CS call - I explained that I’d like to know if my luggage was in transit, the CS guy asked me for the reference number, and I explained that this airline is not like a normal one that would issue one at the airport. He assured me the luggage was in transit but without that PIR (reference number) they would not deliver it to my house, and I’d have to get it from the airport myself.

65,T Masulik,United States,2022-08-08,1,"After boarding and taxying at Quito  we were stuck for two hours before the pilot said we had an engine failure and had to disembark.

We boarded a bus to the airport. The flight was not live on the airport’s departures. When at the airport the check-in for business took 1 hour as the check-in was severely understaffed. The check-in  put the wrong date so we were delayed 30 minutes at immigration while they confirmed the flight even existed. After taking off at 11:30 pm late, the pilot had the audacity to say “we were extremely lucky to be on this flight and that we should thank the technical staff” as we would have had to stay three extra days in Quito had it not been for them as other flights were full”,, merely stating “thank you for your patience”.

69,Ricardo Henriquez,Spain,2022-07-16,6,"I have just realised that Iberia will not credit any more miles with partner airlines, or at least not with the AAdvantage program of American Airlines, In the last 3 or 4 flights that I have done with Iberia, the only way I got my miles credited was by requesting the missing miles through AAdvantage, because Iberia never credits them by itself (in contrast with Qatar or British Airways which credit them in a matter of days). Finally, after requesting missing miles once again, AAdvantage sent me a mail denying my request on grounds of ""Airline unable to validate"". This is despite that I sent the boarding pass issued by Iberia and that my AAdvantage number is printed on the boarding pass itself. It really is disappointing.

The food is nothing special but it is not bad but the wines are all from Spain and lack a little delicacy. The crew have always been very efficient but never particularly friendly.

It also contained other items of both monetary and sentimental value which we are unlikely to ever be able to replace if we don’t get the bag back. We reported it missing at Heathrow and were told we would likely hear something within 24 hours. It’s now been a week and every time we call the phone number we were given, after waiting typically 1 hour on hold, we are just told “there is no information” and no one in the company, no matter how senior, can give us any information about where our case if or if we will ever get it back. This is completely unacceptable to me. We have to wait 21 days before the airline will confirm our bag is lost, meaning we are unsure what we ought to replace and what we should wait for.

This time it cost 52 Euros, which is a pretty good price and worth paying. I got to airport only 2 hours before as I was busy during the day, checked in my carry on (you can for free) as I was filming this experience as well and went through fast track, which was close at London Heathrow, you only got to skip most of the line. The flight was leaving from Gates C, but there is no lounge there, so I went to BA lounge right after security, which was a bit crowded, but managed to get a seat, got some snack and drink, for hot food you have to use QR code and order online, but didn't have much time as boarding started already. Took me like 15 minutes to get there, but you can board any time using priority lane, unfortunately everyone boarded through one jet bridge, even though there were more doors and it could have been done differently. On board I had seat 3L which was really wide, comfortable and I like that its 1-2-1 so everyone has aisle access which is great, unfortunately my IFE wasn't working so I was moved to 8A which is exactly the same type of seat, most private one which is exactly what I wanted so all good. There is no pillow or blanket on this 2 hours flight which makes sense and no pre departure drink which is lacking a bit. Headphones are good though and I can't complain. Seat in general is very wide and comfortable and I'm sure I would be comfortable to be there for 10 or more hours.

Service, no menu, no pre dinner drinks, food served all on one tray covered in foil and plastic wrap. No real explanation of what the food was. No after dinner drinks. I asked for a scotch and I was told that they weren't sure whether it was available. IFE was poor. Offered 30 mins of complimentary WiFi, it did not work. Sleep was impossible due to crew constantly using the toilet at the rear of the BC cabin. Although the toilet was not cleaned until just before we landed and deteriorated during the 10 hour flight. No toiletries available in WC apart from soap. Cabin too warm even for my partner who like me has lived in the tropics for 10 years. No hot towels, no cold towels. Breakfast was lukewarm at best and it consisted of an inedible omelet thing, 3 bread rolls same as for dinner, no butter, a pot if jam, fruit and yogurt, the latter being at least edible.

99,B Richardson,United States,2022-03-03,2,"Most bizarre and ridiculous booking experience. I purchased a ticket on their website that was listed in Euro (112.6 Euro), but then got the receipt, which was in pound (112.6 Sterling). I am from the USA and that resulted in approximately $20 difference. Twenty dollars was not much to get worked up about, but it was so absurd that I had to call. After much back on forth with representative, I was told I would be credited the difference. However, when I got my credit card bill a month later, I realized that the representative had actually given me a credit for 112.6 Euro. That drove me to the website to see if I still had my ticket. Sure enough, my booking no longer existed. So basically I ending up paying $20 to not have a ticket and by this time tickets had almost doubled in price. At this point, I have spent hours on the phone trying to get this issue resolved. Even if the mistake is so obvious, the customer representatives have resisted doing anything about it. Finally, after much nagging, they agreed to look further into it and get back to me in a week. In the meantime, no ticket. A fiction writer could not have come up with a more bizarre set of circumstances. Finally, I just bought another ticket since otherwise I would be stranded and hope they will reimburse me back to original price plus the $20 difference. We will have to see.

106,H Blumenthal,Portugal,2021-11-28,4,"Between average and under average to sum up my flights. Boarding for business passengers in Lima was perfect: very orderly and quick. The usual oldish looking business cabin pretty worn out. When I asked something else than the 2 choices for the welcome drink: plain water or cava (the Spanish sparkling wine), I was told: ""after take off"" Even if I asked for it again twice I had to wait 1h10! and it was given to me at the same time as the meal: Iberia staff likes to make the minimum efforts possible. The dinner was dreadfully presented on a tiny tray (size of a coach meal tray) and in a very oldish and ugly china. No menu with the usual Covid excuse. So I was asked ""Beef or fish?"" and when I asked how they were prepared I got the 2 same words snapped back to me. Food was eatable but certainly no more than that, and the presentation did not make you hungry. Appetizer was canteen style, meat was tough and overcooked, cheese truly bad and desert bad. Apart from the beef or fish, no choice. To be honest the wines were good but once again no menu to know what you were drinking. Between the dinner and the breakfast we never saw a crew member: doesn't Iberia train the cabin crew to treat decently business class clients decently?

108,K Kooistra,Netherlands,2021-11-14,4,"The A350-900, a first for me and I was very excited to fly Iberia for the first time.  The flight was a big disappointment. The problems started at check-in; long queues and unclear instructions on what Covid documents were required to show at this stage caused the queue to move very slowly. Boarding was not much better, the process was slow and unclear.  Passengers stood in wrong rows and the order in which people were being boarded was very chaotic, causing a long queue in the jet bridge. After a 45 minute delay and everybody onboard, IB3166 left Madrid for London. The crew handed out a small sanitation kit and a small bottle of water. There were no menu cards available due to Covid and the menu was not available on the IFE. There was no option to purchase other food or drinks or any of the luxury items Iberia advertises on the IFE, a bit disappointing since I was planning on purchasing some food for my short layover at LHR. The seat on the A350 impressed me, it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom, a relatively large IFE screen and adjustable headrest. The IFE shut down after 30 minutes into the flight and the flight crew refused to help me by resetting the screen. The crew seemed tired and not interested in the passengers. The flight attendants were not visible during the flight and did not respond to people calling for help using the button on the IFE. This caused issues upon arrival at LHR, they did not have a system for deboarding, passengers were queueing in the aisles and pushing forward towards the exit of the aircraft. A very disappointing experience and I expected the Iberia crew to perform far better than this. In conclusion, Iberia showed me to be an airline which is just average when it comes to these flights. The seat on the A350-900 was amazing, but the fact that there was no food service, no system behind the boarding process and the flight crew being uninterested in the passengers experience showed me that I would rather pay more to fly another airline on a route such as this one.",A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to London,November 2021,5.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,2,no,True,Madrid,London,,Neutral,0.4767,  first excite fly iberia first time big disappointment problem start long queue unclear instruction covid document require show stage cause queue move slowly board much good process slow unclear passenger stand wrong row order people board chaotic causing long queue jet bridge 45 minute delay everybody onboard ib3166 leave madrid london crew hand small sanitation kit small bottle water menu card available due covid menu available ife option purchase food drink luxury item iberia advertises ife bit disappointing since plan purchase food short layover lhr seat a350 impress comfortable good amount legroom relatively large ife screen adjustable headrest ife shut 30 minute crew refuse help reset screen crew seem tired interested passenger attendant visible respond people call help use button ife cause issue upon arrival lhr system deboarding passenger queue aisle push forward towards exit disappointing experience expect iberia crew perform far good conclusion iberia show average come flight seat amaze fact food service system behind board process crew uninterested passenger experience show rather pay fly another route one

117,J Rachile,Belgium,2021-09-16,10,"My wife and myself flew recently ACE-MAD-BRU with Iberia, using Avios miles. I haven’t flown with them for some time, and I did not have high expectations when reading passengers comments on this web site and elsewhere. However, most of these comments are about refunds, cancelations, missed connections, missing bags, rude service on board or on the ground, or about problems when trying to contact the airline. Nothing similar happened and I am glad to report that everything went well and was (nearly) perfect for these two flights, in both cases onboard brand-new planes (a A321 neo of Iberia Express, then a A320 neo of Iberia iself). The only criticism I could have is that legroom is limited in C as in Y class, but we secured seats on the very first low (1F & 1D, the 1A and 1C), and this was less of the problem because of the bulkhead. I shall limit myself below to report the service we received on the ground and and in the air, for which all employees and crew members should be complimented. I hope that this will be good for their morale in these days ! Check in at Lanzarote airport was a breeze, as was going through security. We were there early, and spent some time in the small, but nice common lounge, equipped with a side terrace where we enjoyed our last sunny hour of the year. Boarding was done in good order, but we had to go down and up via stairs, despite the fact that an airbridge was available at that stand ; but this Iberia Express, isn’t it ? We took off on time, and a hot lunch was quickly offered thereafter (with above average gnocchi as the main course). The two hours or so of this flight went quicky, and we found that it was just too short. We had a two-hour transit at the busy Madrid hub, where we retired to the much larger, somewhat crowed Iberia Lounge. Boarding for the connecting flight was again on time, and it went as well in good order in these COVID days. Take off was somewhat delayed, but arrival in Brussels was on time, as some recovery margin is built into the schedule. Another hot meal was again quickly offered, this time in the late afternoon (with a steak of a decent size and very tasty ; this was our day of luck !). Crowning this, there was an excellent Rioja 2017, of which I asked for (and got) a second (small) bottle (whereas I did not ask for a second one of the dry white on the previous leg ; airline wine is sometimes as military music). Landing in cold and rainy Brussels came also too quickly, and our suitcases arrived soon on the carousel after a long, but enjoyable journey.

We were stranded for over 24 hours in Madrid because Iberia cancelled our flight and only offered us an alternative the next day. We had a number of out-of-pocket expenses as well as having to take extra time off work. Firstly it was very difficult to get in touch in Iberia. Every time we tried to contact them by phone we were cut off. We were unable to access anyone via the web using the online forms, as they were restricting us from entering information. We tried to go to one of the Iberia counters at one of the airports and they were closed. We sent numerous messages through Messenger on Facebook that were unanswered. Only when we tagged Iberia on a public post on Facebook did they start to answer a message. Even then we were given the run around. Firstly we were fobbed off to BA, who subsequently wrote back and said it was Iberia's responsibility to deal with a particular issue. Iberia advised we could contact Serviberia. When we accessed it, it said 'sorry this page has flown'. Eventually someone in Iberia gave us a correct link we could use to contact Serviberia. The response through Serviberia to our complaint was very disappointing to say the least. It seemed to be just some template letter with a few standard phases and an opt out clause that allowed Iberia not to help us. We just hope that no one else has to go through what we had to endure.

Also I am sapphire in One World for being Paltinum in American Airlines. When the Agent went to deliver my bags to the Iberia counter in Berlin, who spoke very bad Spanish, he did not know the rules of One World. I assumed that traveling in Business I was entitled to at least one suitcase for each passenger but apparently this is not the case. Then I explained to him that because he was a sapphire he had the right to a suitcase in the reserve and he did not recognize me. I ended up having to pay 110 Euros for luggage over the 168 I paid for the business upgrade from Berlin to Madrid and the 63 for the seats on the Madrid Oporto flight. I called Iberia and they informed me that business tickets are always entitled to one piece of luggage. However, the agent in Berlin forced me to pay even while going in business. It seems inconceivable that you have to pay for luggage traveling on business. For your information, on this journey I will travel through Iberia from Madrid to Rome, from Berlin to Porto via Madrid and from Porto to Madrid.

162,F Caren,United States,2020-05-23,1,Left stranded in Madrid by Iberia. The 5+ hour delay from Santiago de Compostela caused by Iberia caused me to miss my Iberia MAD-LAX flight. Iberia did nothing to help me even though they had two seats available on the Iberia MAD-LAX flight the next day. Their excuse is that my agent had booked two separate non-connecting tickets but Iberia did not at minimum offer me and my traveling companion the 250 euros each that they are supposed to offer as per EU regulations for delays of more than 3 hours.

163,J Rankin,United Kingdom,2020-03-28,7,"Madrid to Chicago in Premium Economy. Transitting in Madrid-Barajas  Airport was such a breeze. I would have spent more time in the lounge if it wasn't for the BA staff at LHR T5 not printing my boarding pass so I had to spend 25 minutes at the Iberia transfer desk. After my boarding pass was issued, security was a breeze. I went straight to the Iberia Premium Velasquez Lounge where I was greeted by happy and cheerful agents. Food and beverage options in the lounge had an outstanding selection. Boarding was on time on this very full flight and very orderly. I have oneworld Sapphire status putting me in Group 2. Upon boarding the plane (EC-LUK 'Costa Rica'); the plane was 7 years old and did not show its age. The cabin was very spacious and very clean. The onboard crew were very welcoming, warm and friendly. Amenity kit were distributed along with headphones which were pretty much the same as what BA offers their Club World passengers. The amenity kits were of high quality which is pretty much similar with what some airlines offeres in their business class cabins. The amenity kits did not came with socks, ear plugs and eye mask which were all of high quality. The dental kit was disposable, the bag as a whole is very practical and reusable. Welcome drinks were offered with a choice of orange juice and water in plastic cups, I asked for both and without hesitation the crew were happy to offer both. The whole seat appeared to be clean. High quality blanket and pillow were already on the seat which I later found to be very comfortable for the 9 hour flight. The IFE content had great selections of the latest films in Hollywood which was enough for the 9 hour flight. In total there were more than 50 films in the selection. In addition to films, the IFE also came with a great selection of TV programmes. The disappointing bit was that the Audio selection was poor. We took off on time and the entire flight was fairly smooth. The meal and bar service was average at most. Drinks and food were served the same time. The options were chicken or pasta and I opted for the former which tasted great. Only soft drinks, tea and coffee and wine were offered. Spirits were for purchase. After the meal service, the cabin crew came with a second round for drinks, at this point everyone was resting. The cabin temperature was kept comfortable. The toilets were kept clean.Throughout the flight, the cabin crew were doing hourly rounds of drinks and ensuring the well-being of passengers. I decided walk around, the economy cabin looked immaculate and faily full. Everyone seemed comfortable. I also noticed that the economy seat recline was more than industry average. I was at the back of the plane stretching my leg and had a nice long chat with one of the cabin crew. I requested if I could have a spare amenity kit and I was given one without hesitation. I had a 3 hour nap and I must say it was one of the most comfortable sleep/ nap I had on a plane. The recline was outstanding. The second meal service came with a warm croque-monsieur which was outstanding. In addition, drinks service was included. The plane landed on time. The captain kept us well informed of the flight progress. One thing that I noticed was that the Wi-Fi was fairly expensive. Iberia has lost marks on the basis of: expensive Wi-Fi, the need to pay for Spirits on board and the poor selection music selection.

Chose Iberia for the flight on the basis of their OneWorld membership and presuming them to be full service (and being more expensive than competitors). The problems started early - the itinerary from trip.com said we had to pay for luggage, but the manage my booking function would not work. That meant we could not add one bag at £25 instead of E40. So, at check in we were charged the full E40 despite the person behind the counter admitting they were having issues with 'manage my booking'. On board, there was no included catering in economy. Nor were there menus in the seat pockets so you could try an make an informed choice about what you could buy. Rather, the staff came through the cabin waving the menu as in 'here it is'. We asked to buy some wine, but were then advised that the credit card machine was not working (and as we were leaving Europe for Australia we had spent the last of our Euros at the airport). Rather than offer an apology or a glass of water, the crew just walked off. Iberia on this route is a budget airline. It's embarrassing.

171,N Lameche,France,2020-01-26,1,"We were heading to Rome via Madrid and our flight from Nantes to Madrid got delayed. Before the flight, no information was given to us, one flight attendant told us we were going to make it to our connection on time (also a Iberia flight), but the story changed during the flight. And so we arrived in Madrid too late and we missed our connection. I don't blame Iberia for a technical incident or whatever caused the delay, but once arrived in Madrid, we were told to go at the Iberia help desk to solve the situation. When we arrived at the help desk, there was already more than a hundred people waiting there. And there was no queue and no organization whatsoever. There was  no Iberia staff to be seen except 4 employee busy at the help desk which we had no way of contacting. So we started waiting. This is when we discovered that they were from other planes and some of them were waiting here for more than 4 hours already. At one point, an employee of Iberia finally came out. Naturally, we went to her to ask question. At least to know if there was any form of queue to reach the help desk. So we tried talking to her, in a polite and calm way, and she look at us and .. directly turn her back. Every time we tried to talk to us, she ignore us. Then she started shouting in Spanish.  So we had no clue what was going on. People started rushing to her and she started giving paper away. After a while a person was kind enough to explain to us that she was giving away number for the queue (which didn't exist since people had already been waiting there for hours with nobody organizing anything). At this point it was already too late and we ended up being 150th in the waiting list. So then came 4 hours of waiting to finally reach the help desk. During this time we had to wait standing, with no food and no water -  they didn't even bring water and refused to give voucher for food (against EU traveler rights).  And the help desk was not really helpful, they just book us a new flight and told us to go on. We were pressed on and not given a choice about flights or to spend the night in a hotel and fly the next day. And at this point, it was already late, and our flight was arriving at Roma after midnight, so we had to pay for an expensive night bus and late fee at our hosting place, which Iberia refused to pay for.

182,S Owen,United States,2019-12-11,1,"Disgusting customer service and complete inability to deal with problems. Iberia are scammers. They sold tickets, cancelled the flight and simply refused to take any responsibility. On December 7, Iberia cancelled a transatlantic flight IB2626 from Boston to Barcelona. Passengers were told to go home or to the hotel and wait. On the next morning, we received an email saying that the flight was cancelled (in case someone hadn’t figured that out). That was the only update from the company. Phone customer support refused to deal with the problem. The flight was marketed under Level, an airline brand under which Iberia operates low-cost flights, so we were told to call Level. Level customer reps, in their turn, kept sending us to the operator, Iberia. Level website clearly states that Iberia is the operating carrier for flights to Barcelona. After a dozen back and forth calls we were told to go back to Boston Logan Airport. At the airport, we found over 200 frustrated passengers from the same flight - and no Iberia representatives. None. At the airport information desk we were told that Iberia refused to give any updates to Boston Logan. 2 Iberia reps appeared after 1 pm on December 8, that was 15 hours after the flight was supposed to depart. Their initial response was - again! - to tell us to call Level. Or Vueling? Or someone. And to keep waiting. No attempts to book passengers for other flights were made. Eventually, Iberia reps said they needed to write down passenger names and ticket numbers. When I asked why, they told me they needed to send that information to Iberia office in Madrid. Seriously? The company didn’t have information about 200 people that had already checked in for their flight? After that, we were - again - told to go home. We were not given any information about what to expect, potential compensations, refunds, anything. We called customer service again and asked to book us for a new flight.

I got bumped off my Iberia Flight to Nice in Madrid even though I was at the boarding gate before boarding started and had a boarding pass and had paid extra for choosing a seat.

But the Nice flight was also late so we were at the gate before boarding started. There was 45 minutes wait at the Iberia service counter after we got bumped, so I bought another Iberia ticket on the next flight before they were all allocated. Iberia refused to refund me the second ticket when I eventually got to the service counter where they transferred me to that same flight on my original ticket.

Boarding was completed and we were already running late - cabin crew told us that there was a problem with the luggage - we stood there for one hour in a boarded aircraft, summer heat of 36 degrees outside, cabin crew denied opening the doors to let air in. We were not allowed to take the hand luggage with us (standard procedure, I know), but some had connecting flights and were told that the time would be sufficient (we had that delay of one hour then, had 40 minutes time to change planes...impossible I guess unless that other plane waited. After landing we were told that connecting flights were rescheduled to the regional airline Air Nostrum, but we did not have our luggage, so I had to get my luggage, leave the airport and enter again, go through airport security. Unfortunately, Iberia could not tell us which gate we should go to and told us we should talk to the customer service to find out more. Well, there was a line of 50-100 passengers and 4 employees. So many of us just waited without being able to talk to customer service for our connecting flight. We were hoping that at some point some information would be released. -During those hours of uncertainty I tried to talk to Iberia personnel and was told that I should wait in line. Iberia personnel would even avoid me, when I talked to them, they were just starting to talk to their colleagues. I would have never expected this experience in my life.

246,Emily Hart,United States,2019-01-18,1,"On Thursday, December 27th, my fiancé and I were scheduled to fly New York to Madrid. At 8:30, we all lined up to board and then after standing for 30 minutes with no direction, we were told that the plane had a mechanical issue. For the following three hours, we were given vague and unhelpful updates roughly once an hour. This was stressful since it was getting later and later in the night. Finally, close to 11:30, we were told the flight was cancelled in Spanish. The message was not repeated in English for another three minutes. We then proceeded down to baggage claim and there was no one from Iberia to direct us or tell us what was happening. We waited in complete confusion for close to 30 minutes. Finally, we were let through a door and told to write our name, phone number and email on a white sheet of printer paper and that they would be getting buses to take us to a hotel. Everyone on our flight was very confused why we were being asked to write our information down as we assumed that any airline would already have this information in their system. At this point, we took a cab and returned to our apartment in Brooklyn to attempt to get some sleep. We were told we would get a phone call or text letting us know when the plane was fixed. At 2:53AM, we woke up to the sound of a text saying our itinerary was changed. We were now scheduled to leave on December 28th at 18:59 to London, have a three-hour layover and then take another flight from London to Madrid. I immediately called Iberia and spoke to an incredibly rude customer service rep. She told me that Iberia already changed my ticket for free so any other change would require a fee. I have never heard of a policy like this. I knew there was a 5:00 (17:00) direct flight on Dec 28th and I at the very least I wanted to get on that. After a very frustrating conversation with no apology or resolution, I attempted to get more sleep. At 7:05AM, I got another text saying that our original flight was delayed to 15:30 and to call the airport at 12:30 to check. I immediately called Iberia to ask about that flight status and why our itinerary didn’t show that flight and the customer service representative could not explain this. They said that the 15:30 flight did not exist and/or that we didn’t have tickets on it. At this point, we were confused whether we should go back to JFK with no ticket or go for our new flight with the connection. I finally reached a customer service rep,  who told us there was nothing he could do. At that point, I asked to speak to his manager and suddenly he said that he could get us on the 17:00 direct flight. I’m confused why this wasn’t an option from the beginning. When we arrived at the airport and returned to our original gate from the previous night around 3:45PM, we were told that our original flight from Thursday night departed at 3:30 (15:30). I do not understand why we weren’t given the option to be on that flight. The lack of clear communication is unacceptable. I have submitted a formal complaint to Iberia about the situation, asking for reimbursement for the cabs and hotel room we had to pay for, but did not use in Spain, and I was sent a generic apology email saying it was out of their control.

249,O Salinger,Italy,2019-01-11,4,"Turin to Madrid via Chicago. My family and I arrived at Chicago airport on December 21st, flying from Madrid. Part of our baggage was missing. A nice lady at the carousel was already informed of the occurrence and prepared a claim for us. Apparently this is something that happens quite often. She pointed out to a pile of baggage from the previous day, same flight. She said the baggage would be delivered to our location the next day. We were a little disappointed because the baggage contained all the kids' clothes and presents for the people we were visiting, but it's a busy time to travel, things like that happen and we were pleased with the way things were handled until then. The next day nobody called to schedule the delivery, nor the baggage was delivered. So the day after (December 23rd) we call the airline. A gentlemen speaking a bad English informed us that the baggage was likely in Madrid but could not confirm the location or when it would be delivered. Likewise, no information on the Iberia website. We would have to call the next day. That was starting to be a little too much annoying. Finally on December 24th we were informed that the baggage was boarded on the flight to Chicago and that it would be delivered the same evening or at latest the next morning. At night we found a voicemail informing to call before 8:30pm or the next morning for the delivery. So on Christmas morning we called, we were informed that the baggage was actually at the airport closest to our location (about 20 miles away) but it would not be delivered because Iberia does not pay the courier. If we wanted our suitcase, we would have to go and pick it up at the airport! That's what we did. Of course we issued a claim, requesting compensation for the emergency clothing we had to buy, for the travel expense to go and pick up the baggage and for the inconvenience of having to do so on Christmas morning after waiting for the baggage for 4 days.

263,M Gardner,United Kingdom,2018-12-01,3,"Disappointing flight from start to finish. Think twice before booking. We booked to fly to Lima, Peru through British Airways (BA) and they routed us on Iberia (IB) going via Madrid as they done do Lima direct. I felt comfortable selecting the Iberia flight knowing that the two airlines merged several years ago , and I assumed they would be quite similar in standard. Unfortunately that was not the case, Iberia is a vastly inferior service with lazy staff who treat passengers with disdain. We flew in Premium Economy(PE), something that IB has added to their aircraft around 18 months ago; we traveled on a Airbus 340-600. Boarding: the gate was absolute chaos - no signage to indicate where each class of travel should queue, and only 2 staff members to manage a crowd of 350 passengers. No priority given to people in wheelchairs or families traveling with push buggies etc. Onboard: the PE hard product looked good; Seats were standard premium economy and the bulkhead seat was spacious. The tv screens were modern, large with sharp picture quality. Unfortunately there were several coffee stains on the cabin walls and my footrest was broken. The crew: they were very lax. No cabin crew pointing out emergency exit, or any form of demo - just a pre recorded met. Throughout the 12 hour flight when ever the captain turned on the fasten seatbelt sign (5-6 times), the crew only made verbal announcements but no crew member actually came round to check that passengers were safely buckled up. When there was turbulence during meal service the crew would just carry on - even walking around with a hot pot of coffee serving passengers! The toilets were dirty all three times I used the facilities- no crew went in to tidy it at any point during the flight. The crew were literally just doing the bare essentials- well, not even. They were not particularly friendly either, no smiles no banter, just dropped the food on your tray table and moved to the next seat. Between meal service there were no crew to be seen. The food and beverages: the food in PE was economy food, as were the beverages (wine choice was “red or white”) and no spirits were served. No pre meal drinks service either. The food menu listed did not match the food being served. Summary: Iberia as a whole were extremely disappointing. The crews lack of adherence to standard air safety protocol is concerning.

265,Nadir Aslam,United States,2018-11-15,4,"New York to Venice via Madrid. Flew on an AA codeshare RT flight from JFK-VCE with a transfer in Madrid. Iberia's new A350-900 is a beautiful plane. Cabin comfort is awesome even though seat pitch is terrible. Although I picked seat 38L which is by far the best seat in economy. Overall I was very happy with the service I received even if it was minimal and basic. The highlight of flying with Iberia is Madrid-Barajas airport which is one of the most beautiful in the world. Being Sapphire on One World I was also able to use their gorgeous VIP lounge and take a shower before my flight from Madrid to Venice. The reception desk employees couldn't have been more disinterested however. Their inter-european flights are horrible however. It's run like a budget airline where you have to pay 2 Euros for water. That's pathetic. Also the A319 I flew both directions was ancient and dirty and shouldn't have been in service in that condition. The water in the forward cabin restroom didn't work and instead they had towelettes to wash your hands. That's not acceptable. The flight back from Madrid to JFK was comfortable however service was absolutely terrible. They advertise WiFi but I couldn't get it to work after being in the air and at cruising altitude for over an hour. When I asked the flight attendant she gruffly told me that they haven't turned it on yet and that ""Usted tiene que estar patiente"" as if she was scolding a 5 year old. I'm not sure why that was necessary. When the WiFi did work it was so slow as to be rendered unusable. During the flight there was a 5 hour stretch where they couldn't be bothered to come through the aisle to even offer water or juice. This was unacceptable. Also they used the excuse of turbulence. I finally got up and asked the flight attendant in the back if I could please have some water. He poured me a cup and when I handed him the glass back he rudely snapped at me in Spanish saying: ""Don't you see the seatbelt sign is on? You are supposed to be in your seat."" It was uncalled for and inexcusable. At the end of the day they used the turbulence excuse in order to sit in the back of the plane and chat. Later I tested them by pressing my FA call button. They never came to my seat. That's no good. Of course when the final meal before landing was being served we were flying through extremely rough turbulence. But it wasn't enough in that case to suspend service? My overall takeaway is I would avoid Iberia in the future and fly AA-BA codeshare flights in the future. My overall impression of Iberia is that of a third-rate airline and is one of the weakest links in the One World Alliance.",A350,Business,Economy Class,New York to Venice via Madrid,November 2018,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3,no,True,New York,Venice,Madrid,Positive,0.9477,  new york venice via madrid fly aa codeshare rt transfer madrid iberia new beautiful cabin comfort awesome though seat pitch terrible although picked seat 38l far best seat economy overall happy service receive minimal basic highlight fly iberia airport one beautiful world sapphire one world able use gorgeous vip lounge take shower madrid venice reception desk employee disinterested however flight horrible however run like budget pay 2 euros water pathetic a319 fly direction ancient dirty service condition water forward cabin restroom work instead towelettes wash hand acceptable back madrid jfk comfortable however service absolutely terrible advertise wifi get work air cruise altitude hour ask attendant gruffly turn yet usted tiene que estar patiente scold 5 year old sure necessary wifi work slow render unusable 5 hour stretch bother come aisle offer water juice unacceptable use excuse turbulence finally get ask attendant back please water pour cup hand glass back rudely snap spanish say see seatbelt sign suppose seat uncalled inexcusable end day use turbulence excuse order sit back chat later test press fa call button never come seat good course final meal land serve fly extremely rough turbulence enough case suspend service overall takeaway avoid iberia future fly codeshare flight future overall impression iberia one weak link one world alliance

292,C Norton,Singapore,2018-08-10,1,"Jerez to London via Madrid. The customer service for this airline is as bad as bad can be. I have called countless times and the level of rudeness and lack of care is appalling. As a business class passenger who paid extra for seats and service, I am not getting what I paid for. Delayed flight - rude service - lost luggage. I would not fly them again and warn anyone transiting via Madrid to do so at risk of your luggage. What has followed since they failed to put my luggage on my flight at Madrid has been excruciatingly painful.  It took 5 days to return the luggage - I had 2 pieces which both arrived at different times (first took 2 days and second took 4 days) Every time I call Iberia they have incorrect information.

293,Oleg Martens,United States,2018-08-08,1,"My review concerns Iberia's and Vueling's behavior with regards to a flight I had to take from Brussels to Barcelona on 17th June 2018. As I was downloading my boarding pass on August 16th, I noticed that my flight time had been moved from a mid-afternoon to an early morning time. Further, I saw that my flight had been moved from the 17th to the 20th. Since I was heading to Barcelona for business, with presentations on the morning of the 18th, this change of schedule did not work for me. I called Iberia about the issue (since I booked my flight through Iberia's website), but was told I should talk to Vuelig since they operated the flight. I tried to reach Vueling, but never managed to reach a human. Showed up at Brussels airport first thing the next morning to try and speak to a representative, but the person manning the desk for both Iberia and Vueling told me she did not actually work for either company and could not help. Finally find out that all Vuelig flights have been cancelled due to French controller air strike. However, also find out that Brussels airlines has not cancelled its flights and so manage to book a last minute ticket with them. It's important to note that during all of this, not once was I notified by either Iberia or Vueling that my flight had been changed, and this despite the fact that both companies had my cell phone number and email address. Also, when I filed a complaint with Vueling, I was told it was an Iberia problem since I booked through Iberia. And when I filed a complaint with Iberia, I was told it was a Vueling problem because they operated the flight. three weeks into arguing with each airline, they both stated that under EU law, they are protected because the French strike was none of their doing. Neither company has taken any responsibility for the lack of communication (which I find very unprofessional), and neither has offered to compensate me for the new ticket I had to purchase + all of the unecessary stress they created by cancelling the flight and not offering me any reasonable options (3 days later is not a reasonable option for a business traveler). Overall, very disapointed and feel like neither company cares much about customers. I indicated as much to both companies and neither has cared to provide a response since telling me EU law allows them to bahave in such a manner. I have travelled all over the world over the last 35 years, and this is by far the worst customer service and ownership of responsibility I have ever experienced.",A320,Business,Economy Class,Madrid to Brussels,June 2018,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,,3,no,True,Madrid,Brussels,,Negative,-0.9684,  review concern iberia vueling behavior regard take brussels barcelona 17th june 2018 download board pas august 16th noticed time move early morning time saw move 17th 20th since head barcelona business presentation morning 18th change schedule work call iberia issue since book iberia website talk vuelig since operate tried reach vueling never manage reach human show brussels airport first thing next morning try speak representative person man desk iberia vueling actually work either company help finally find vuelig flight cancel due french controller air strike however find brussels airline cancel flight manage book last minute ticket important note notify either iberia vueling change despite fact company cell phone number email address file complaint vueling iberia problem since book iberia file complaint iberia vueling problem operate three week argue state eu law protect french strike none neither company take responsibility lack communication find unprofessional neither offer compensate new ticket purchase unecessary stress create cancel offer reasonable option 3 day later reasonable option business traveler overall disapointed feel like neither company care much customer indicate much company neither care provide response since tell eu law allow bahave manner travel world last 35 year far worst customer service ownership responsibility ever experience
294,B Millen,Germany,2018-08-08,1,"I tried to travel from Madrid to Hamburg with a valid ticket that I had purchased and paid 2 months ago in combination with some Iberia miles. When I got to the airport 3 hour early, I was not allowed to check-in as I could not present the credit card I had paid the ticket with. My card expired last month and since I had already paid for the ticket and obviously I got rid off the old card. The man working at the ticket office at Iberia at Madrid airport was extremely rude and did not give a damn about helping me: I presented my email ticket showing proof of my purchase with my name on it. That was not enough. I presented to him a photo proof of my credit card proving that the card was indeed mine which he did not accept. I showed him the credit card bill with the Iberia charge showing that I had paid for the ticket and there was not fraud.  He told me that I could not get on the plane and he would not even let me cancel my existing reservation and pay for the same seat on the same plane again. I was told that the Iberia flights during the next two days were fully booked up so that he could not even make me another reservation for me on another day. I went online to see if that was true and there were seats available on both days. He told me that Iberia and Iberia Plus are two different companies and that he could not help me since part of my ticket was paid with my miles. He said he had nothing to do with my ticket reservation and gave me the phone number of Iberia miles so that they could fix the problem. He would not even call on my behalf to Iberia Plus given that I am not a native Spanish speaker. At Iberia Plus on the phone I was  told that they could not verify my card.

295,R Tram,United States,2018-08-02,6,"New York to Zagreb via Madrid. Overall, the travel experience was okay. Ground service was horrible. Cabin service was good. Food acceptable. Iberia apparently changed my seat on the connecting flight from MAD to ZAG, which I had pre-selected. By the time I looked at my boarding pass hours later and realized my seat had changed on the second flight, it was too late. Since that leg was much shorter, I didn't bother to change the seat. Boarding was chaotic, the US ground staff at JFK don't seem to care. When boarding began, a hoard of passengers stood on the business class queue. I suspected something was awry and asked people if the line they were on was for business class (as the sign clearly indicated). They shrugged and stayed on the line. As the gate agent started boarding people, he realized that practically everyone's boarding pass he scanned was NOT business class. Only then did he announce that business class passengers were being boarded first. All of a sudden, the line shrunk to 1/10 of what it was before. Once onboard, the cabin service was much better and the remainder of the trip was okay.

296,K Tellonm,Germany,2018-08-01,1,"Santiago de Chile to Madrid. You can't expect much when booking a cheap fare but at least I am expecting a minimum standard of quality on every flight, no matter if I fly on a LCC or a premium airline. My first contact with the airline was at the checkin desk. I tried to purchase an upgrade but they said that it wasn't possible today. I was okay with that and went to the gate to ask if they can at least give me an empty row as the flight was very empty (I assume the load in Y was about 30-40%). The gate agent was very unsupportive and told me to search for a free seat once I'm in the plane. Eventually, after asking her a second time, I got my free row (an absolute standard request). On board, we were ""welcomed"" by the purser who seemed very uninterested in her job. The crew overall seemed not to like their job, except for some of the FAs (one of them was our ""service FA""). They barely speak any English (or just don't want to). The procedures were very unorganized and chaotic. The seat comfort was fine but there wasn't much leg space (not much of a problem thanks to the free neighbor seat). The blanket colored my black shirt so I had to change it afterward (luckily, I had just hand luggage and some shirts with me). I lifted the armrest and there was dust and lots of dirt. I looked up the plane and it had been delivered to IB in 2010. It appears that it has not been properly cleaned ever since (see the images). The food for dinner (Lasagne) was acceptable. The drink service was okay. Breakfast was delivered in boxes and a bit small but okay. I complaint to the airline about the cleanliness by an official form at MAD as well as via FB. The ground staff at MAD was very friendly and apologized for the inconvenient situation. I received a reply from the customer relations department the day after: “To ensure the utmost hygiene on every flight, the aircraft are always cleaned immediately after arrival at destination. However, air traffic control limitations and the length of the aircraft's stopover mean that occasionally we have to do this in less time. Please accept my apologies if the seat was not in perfect condition.""  Fast cleaning may not include the cleaning under the armrests but it should be normal to do it at least every other month. As my connection (A320) had dirt at the same place, IB seems to be cleaning their aircraft not very well. Wifi is very overpriced (about 5$ for 4MB). In short: The ground staff (an agent on behalf of IB) in SCL was bad, the crew not good (except for some of the members), food acceptable, cleanliness disastrous.

301,L Sigursson,Iceland,2018-07-16,2,"Madrid to Keflavik. After an otherwise wonderful holiday we arrived at Madrid airport. Their check in computers jumped to Spanish completely randomly, causing you to start all over again, until it completely crashed. There was no help to get from the Iberia staff on location and the solution was to check in manually. While waiting in line, the barriers were changed two times causing 50+ people to rearrange everything, with expected results. Almost at the end of the cue, a staff member pulls us and two other couples out of the cue, says something in Spanish and walks away. I catch up with him for explanations, and he tries to explain that he has other check in desks around the corner. We get there only to face the most unfriendly check in agent I have ever seen, who tell us that we have no checked luggage for the flight. When presented with the receipt for both flight and luggage, she claims that the receipt is invalid since it's from a third party, (Flight Network), and proceeds to charge us €70 extra. The other options would be to leave it behind, or not go on the flight we already paid for. At this point the atmosphere was not good to say the least. But a tiny plus was that she managed to assign to us seats on 3rd row. When we entered the plain we saw that this was behind the business class divider. The seats were a different color than the rest of the economy class seats, but otherwise the same shape and size so I thought nothing of it, until a stewardess came and asked us to relocate as she needed those seats for someone else. I tried to explain that we had been assigned those seats for the discomfort of the check in errors. She immediately got very unfriendly and said that we were being moved, because we had not purchased business class seats, and it was clear that we had no choice in the matter if we wanted to fly at all! She then moved the divider back one row. Throughout the flight the 3rd row seats A-F, remained empty! After relocating, the flight crew continued to be unfriendly.

306,K Simons,United States,2018-06-14,8,"Santiago de Compostela to New York via Madrid. Flew from Santiago de Compostela on Iberia Express to Madrid yesterday to connect to our Iberia flight to New York. I can see why Iberia Express gets its 'most punctual airline' reputation. Boarding was swift, very organized and we departed about 5mins ahead of schedule. On board, sadly there wasn't much to say except the legroom was very tight and even a coffee had to be paid for. The crew seemed pleasant and helpful. I was however, not able to connect to the advertised free streaming entertainment at all. Not a huge deal breaker as it was a short flight. I had decided to take up an email offer to upgrade my next sector to New York and was so glad I did. Having priority boarding as a part of it was a huge plus on this maxed out A340-600. I loved the Premium Economy seat with the extra recline and legroom was great. It's a fresh, relatively small, more private cabin than the wild expanse of regular economy. The larger, responsive, IFE screen worked well and had just enough options to keep me occupied for 7 hours. The very slightly upgraded meal (main served in a china dish) was fairly decent thought it took quite a while after take off before it was served. There was no bar service before this. The crew were warm and pleasant though and seemed to be constantly working. We sat in row 15 which is only slightly ahead of the galley, so could hear everything and the light from the galley was distracting at times. The pre-arrival snack of a boxed sandwich was fine and we arrived only slightly late into JFK. All in all, I'd recommend Iberia's Premium Economy if you do get an email offer to upgrade.

324,C Huang,United Kingdom,2018-02-20,1,"London to Lima in December 2017, with a stopover in Madrid. As soon as I arrived in Lima, I was told that my baggage was delayed. They issued me a ticket, saying the baggage would arrive the day after and that I should pick it up from the airport. That would be fine - but the day after would be the only opportunity for me to pick it up in Lima, as I would travel to other places in Peru after that, for 15 days. The day after - I arrived at the airport to find the desk closed, and the Info help desk tried in vain to help us call the number stated in the directory. No answer. For the next 15 days, I would be making daily phone calls to their helpline. By the way, they only allow you to call the ""call centre"" but the people here cannot really help you - they don't know what's happening on the ground, neither can they make any decisions regarding your request. I asked them to send my baggage to Cusco where I was - call centre people said ""yes, we will leave a message for the airline to do so"". But every day i called up the luggage would still be in Lima and the call centre people kept saying ""yes we will leave the message"". This went on until my final day when i was in Lima to fly out of Peru and there, i picked up the luggage myself (after a very convoluted process at the airport in itself).

329,J Maguire,Ireland,2018-02-07,1,I booked Iberia for a family holiday to South Africa to visit family. Booked the flights nearly a year in advance to get the best prices. When I phoned to add a new born baby to the booking a number of months later I discovered that the flight time for the first leg had changed so I didn't have time to transfer for the second leg. Iberia were offering a full refund. But a refund is no good as then you have no flight. And as months had passed the prices on all airlines had increased. I had no choice but to accept the refund and pay extra to book flights with another airline. Or cancel the trip. I have since heard of other people having similar problems with Iberia on long haul routes. Where parts of the journey are cancelled close to the departure date and Iberia just shrug and offer a refund leaving people with no flights to where they are going.

333,D Cooper,United Kingdom,2018-01-08,4,"Flying from Bogota to London via Madrid, we travelled in Premier Economy expecting to enjoy some more comfort and better service. The seats and additional space were definitely better however the service was appalling, again. We fly reasonably regularly to Bogota, and every time we fly Iberia we are disappointed. This time the Steward attending our seats was rude and impatient. Regularly not waiting to hear our question or food order before leaving and bringing back what he thought we'd asked for. He was abrupt and often didn't bring what he offered and we asked for eg. a glass of water. The food was poor again but having travelled Iberia on this route a few times we expected poor food. On top of this, I asked for a gin and tonic with my meal and was told I'd have to pay for the gin. This I didn't expect having paid for premium economy tickets on a long haul flight. I wouldn't expect this in economy either on a long haul flight. Perhaps my expectations are wrong. I thought Iberia and BA were premium National carrier airlines, not budget airlines like Ryanair. Then on landing in London, we were advised that our luggage didn't make our connecting flight. We filled in our missing baggage forms and were told they would be delivered that evening. Of course they weren't. I checked the tracking numbers which said the new flights our baggage was supposedly on had landed had 4pm. I say flights because they split our bags over 2 different flights. I say supposedly as the tracking website said they hadn't located our baggage. Calling the helpline the next day they confirmed the new flights landed the day before but still couldn't confirm if they had our baggage. Our wait continues.

334,Keith Cygan,United States,2018-01-02,2,"Chicago to Seville with a layover stop in Madrid. After booking the flight, I realized I spend the beginning part of my trip in Madrid. After arriving in Madrid, I did not board the second flight to Seville. Unbeknownst to me, Iberia cancelled my return flights (Seville to Madrid and Madrid to Chicago). When I arrived at the airport in Seville, I was informed that my ticket was no longer valid and that I would need to repurchase a new ticket. Iberia did not contact me to inform me prior to my arrival at the airport, despite the fact that a week had passed since my flight from Chicago to Madrid. In fact, two days before my return flight, I received an e-mail from Iberia titled ""Comunicación operativa: Información sobre su vuelo"" (Flight Information). This e-mail gave no indication that my flights had been cancelled. I ended up buying a ticket on the same flights as my original booking - Iberia did not refund my money for the flights they  cancelled. I submitted a complaint through Iberia's website on November 28th in which I requested a refund for the flights they cancelled. I received this response on December 22nd: ""Certain fares do not accept refund and have a number of limitations with regard to changes in the route or sequence of reserved routes. For this reason, if the journey does not start, our system automatically cancels the ticket and if any of the purchased journeys is not used, the remaining routes included in the ticket will be cancelled.
