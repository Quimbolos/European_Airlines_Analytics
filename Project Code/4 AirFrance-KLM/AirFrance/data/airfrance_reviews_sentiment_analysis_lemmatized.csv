0,L Neiman,United States,2023-11-15,1,"Air France lost our three bags, someone was in my seat on the plane. The woman who tried to help us fill out forms about our missing bags could barely use the touch screen, so we had to do it for her completely. We had to wait more than three hours after we got off the plane to get our bags at our destination after they were left in Paris (our layover). The aircraft’s wheels were exceptionally squeaky, and they screeched loudly constantly while we were on the ramp. Also, the food was terrible. It was a sloppy cream cheese and cucumber “sandwich”. It was barely edible. They forced us to check our bags in the first case despite there being plenty of open seats and thus, room to carry our bags onto the plane like normal.

1,Derek Northcutt,United States,2023-11-15,2,"Very disappointing and that has become the normal experience with Air France. Poor catering on board, and on a nine-hour flight no one came to offer more drinks. I went to the back to fetch my own but found that the cabin crew had sealed off our compartment (limiting 16 rows to one toilet) with locked curtains, so they can be alone. Upon arrival, there was no wheelchair for me (and this happens all the time at CDG airport). I have an artificial leg and it is difficult for me to walk long distances, yet they have me walk up the boarding bridge to the lobby, then walk outside to catch their van, where it drops you off at another terminals and you have to walk up steps and then an elevator and then a longish walk to where they have their wheelchair staff. If you wish to fly with this group, choose KLM who are efficient, they have wheelchairs available when you arrive, take you to where you want to go. We flew to Bucharest, and there has never been a wheelchair waiting for me so I guess they do not do that there. My last three trips with AF/KLM have resulted in delayed suitcases of up to a week.

4,C Huang,United States,2023-11-09,1,I’ve been on “bad” airlines and even though the amenities may be lacking the customer service was at least decent. This cannot be said for Air France. After struggling to find room to store my luggage I had to squeeze my way up and ask the flight attendant for assistance. She told me “you need to figure that out yourself” along with “I don’t know how to help you”. I kept telling her that I wasn’t able to find bin space and that I needed help moving stuff out of the way (I’m 4’11 I can barely reach the bins) along with lifting my suitcase into a bin but she kept saying “you need to figure it out on your own”.

5,Catalin Alexandru Glavan,Switzerland,2023-11-08,3,"I recently booked a round-trip flight from Zurich to Antananarivo with Air France, and the experience was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, it was a series of mishaps and poor service that left me deeply stressed and unsatisfied. The outbound flight from Zurich was delayed by more than 30 minutes. This delay put us in a precarious situation, and we were forced to rush to catch our connecting flight at Paris CDG. The stress of almost missing our connection was certainly not the ideal way to begin a vacation. On the return journey, the problems persisted. The flight from Antananarivo to Paris CDG experienced another significant delay, causing us to miss our initial connection to Amsterdam. While we were rebooked on a later flight, the flight from Paris CDG to Amsterdam was delayed by 30 minutes. In an attempt to ensure we caught our connection in Amsterdam, we requested assistance from a flight attendant, only to be met with a disrespectful attitude and a dismissive response. Upon arriving in Zurich, the troubles continued as our luggage was nowhere to be found. Three of our bags were stuck in Amsterdam, and one in Paris CDG. We were left waiting for over 2 hours and 30 minutes for our luggage from Amsterdam to arrive in Zurich. This was particularly distressing because two of us had another flight scheduled for the following day and were uncertain whether our luggage would make it in time. As a result, we also missed our train connection from Zurich Airport to Thun. To top it all off, the in-flight meals provided by Air France were subpar at best. On the way to Antananarivo, the tomato salad had a rotten taste, and for a 10-hour flight, the meal options were shockingly limited. On the return journey, the meals were disappointing, with the second meal consisting of bread with some sauce, a cold mini croissant, a jam, and a yogurt. In summary, my experience with Air France on this trip was marred by delays, unhelpful staff, lost luggage, and inadequate in-flight meals.  I expected better service and reliability for the price I paid, and this experience fell far short of those expectations.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Antanarivo to Zurich via Paris,November 2023,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2,no,True,Antanarivo,Zurich,Paris,Negative,-0.9839,  recently book zurich antananarivo air experience nothing short nightmare start finish series mishap poor service leave deeply stress unsatisfied outbound zurich delay 30 minute delay put us precarious situation force rush catch connect paris cdg stress almost miss connection certainly ideal way begin vacation return journey problem persist antananarivo paris cdg experience another significant delay cause us miss initial connection amsterdam rebooked later paris cdg amsterdam delayed 30 minute attempt ensure caught connection amsterdam request assistance attendant meet disrespectful attitude dismissive response upon arrive zurich trouble continue luggage nowhere find three bag stick amsterdam one paris cdg leave wait 2 hour 30 minute luggage amsterdam arrive zurich particularly distress two us another schedule follow day uncertain whether luggage make time result miss train connection zurich airport thun top meal provide air subpar best way antananarivo tomato salad rotten taste meal option shockingly limited return journey meal disappointing second meal consist bread sauce cold mini croissant jam yogurt summary experience air trip mar delay unhelpful staff lose luggage inadequate meal expect good service reliability price pay experience fell far short expectation

9,Jennifer Morrison,United States,2023-11-01,3,"I fly Air France frequently to and from French Polynesia and can honestly say I have always had a great experience. My most recent was however not a pleasant one. Neither leg of my roundtrip flight was enjoyable and felt like more of a budget airline. We are frequent travelers and book specific seats. we know which seats are not good. a month before they changed planes, and we were forced into seats that we would not have choose as they do not recline as much as the rest of that class. Well, we were stuck and had no other seats to move too. On top of that my seat was broken and the footrest could not be used. So not only did I have a seat that did not recline like the rest now I had a broken footrest. The only option was to move to a middle seat away from my family and sit by strangers. I might have just sat in economy because the premium was really not premium. The staff is amazing as always and so very nice, but wow the food was absolutely horrific on both flights.

We boarded on time at 3.30pm for a 4.05pm departure from BEY to CDG, and shortly after pushing back we were informed of a technical problem. We returned to the gate and were told one hour later that it was fixed. However shortly after pushing back again, the pilot announced the problem was still not fixed and that the plane's radar was out of order. We were then offered to fly to Athens as the weather there was good and ""didn't require a radar"". Another AF flight would then take us to Paris. However half the passengers decided to leave the plane. I decided to stay but after more than 5 hours, we were still stuck in the plane with no food or drink served. Then the pilot said the flight was canceled because the weather had changed! A hostess started shouting at us with conflicting instructions about disembarking and then returning to our seats - a complete chaos with children crying. After disembarking it was a total mess a no one knew on which flight they would be rebooked. We ended being sent to a cheap hotel at midnight. It was impossible to get any help from AF's call center as it is based in North Africa and their totally useless staff were not even able to provide accurate information (they said there was no flight before 2 days later while I managed to get a booking the next day by talking directly to the airport staff).

Only one hot meal was served after take off (despite the 14-hour flight duration due to Russian airspace restrictions).

No power socket, only USB plugs - quite unacceptable for Premium Economy. No wifi.

After scrambling around the airport for hours, we found someone to speak to who managed to get us on the original flight and a new flight leaving from Paris, with a delay of 2 hours.

14,J Borgen,United States,2023-10-14,3,"Strike among air controllers in Paris caused particular problems due to delays. Sitting in an Air France plane waiting during delayed boarding is torture given the NOISE that is played. Made by a 12 year old who knows three chords and got his hands on a synthesizer? Awful. Same mind numbing noise if you call AF. Flying in “comfort” Premium Economy for $3,660 RT is horrendously overpriced given the food and lack of attention. This was a fairly common Business Class fare. Except for a seat that is less uncomfortable than in economy and a pouch with a toothbrush etc., there is nothing to justify the price difference. Dinners were served, both ways, with a main dish in a rectangular box hidden in mashed potatoes. Return flight I chose duck. Sounds nice, right? More like pre- chewed something mixed with, or hidden underneath, mashed potatoes. On neither flight (to and from Paris) did anybody stop to ask if I would like another wine or more water. No drinks before dinner. Nothing to differentiate this “Premium class” from economy. Stewards steamed backwards with cart returning from economy without so much as looking sideways to quickly reach the sanctity of the galley between business class and the Premium Economy. You will not get any kind of service or attention that differentiates you from those in economy seats. It may be Air France’s intention that there should be a difference, but I have on my three flights with AF this year seen none of it! None. While there are three or four bathrooms provided for business class in front of you, you will in the Premium section have longest walk to a bathroom of any passenger onboard. True! As I saw that many passengers (especially couples) are in their 60s and 70s this is another reason this Premium section does not warrant its price. The walk back through the economy section in the dark with pillows, blankets, and feet in the way is no fun. In reaching the very back of the plane there were three thin brown sandwiches in a large box waiting, together with a few chewable candies also in a large box and two stewardesses far less interested in engaging with a passenger than in talking among themselves. And it is especially here that KLM has a leg up on Air France. More often, but not always, do KLM personnel seem more friendly and engaging. With reference to my observations in the above, try KLM premium and compare for yourself. The Air France lounge is nice, but if given the opportunity, check out KLM’s main lounge in Amsterdam. Also very nice. Conclusion, suffer economy for 8.5 to 10.5 hours and treat yourself (with the significant amount of money not wasted) to a nicer hotel and great and expensive meal upon arrival! And, on this particular flight, you will guaranteed be closer to bathroom if you book an economy seat!

18,R Habasi,Morocco,2023-10-02,1,"Disappointing Business Class Experience on Air France. My wife and I recently flew with Air France in business class from Rabat to Manchester, with a connecting flight in Paris. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience that did not meet our expectations. On September 28, we boarded our flight from Rabat to Paris. The business class seats were barely an upgrade from economy, with limited recline and lacking amenities. The meal service was lacking - a small cold pasta salad and no appetizer or dessert. Upon arriving at CDG, there was no priority boarding or fast track security for business class passengers. We waited in a long queue for 35 minutes to board our connecting flight to Manchester. Again, the business class meal was mediocre - a small cold sandwich. On our return journey on October 1, we decided to fly economy class. Our flight from Manchester departed 15 minutes late. We were anxious about missing our connection in Paris due to the delay. The food was disappointing. Our flight landed in Paris 25 minutes late, giving us under 40 minutes to catch our connection to Rabat. We rushed through the airport and reached the gate just in time. However, upon landing in Rabat, we were informed that our checked luggage had been left behind in Paris. We had to return to the airport at 11:30pm when Air France sent the bags on a later flight.

The flight was delayed and we were stuck on the tarmac for 3 hours with no adequate food or drinks. Truly awful experience. Then they lost our bags containing clothes and gifts for the wedding. The bags arrived 3 days late damaged. They have not compensated us for the damage! They had a major server breakdown and communication via the website was impossible. We were told they lost 15,000 bags that day. The office in Kinshasa could not access any systems to register our loss but told us they would register on our behalf.

21,H Martin,United Kingdom,2023-09-21,1,"The quality of Air France is disgraceful to the point I won't fly any sky alliance flights again. We were flying back to Johannesburg for our wedding and so wanted the experience to be slightly more special. Paid for an upgrade to business class at the airport for Paris to JHB. Firstly, we received better drinks service in economy coming back than going out in business class. After our boarding drink was poured and we were in the air I asked if I could get a drink, twice, to once be told they would be with me soon, and when we were still ignored my partner then asked for a whiskey and he was told you can wait till after dinner. I understand that if you have been drinking prior to your flight and appear intoxicated, then you are not going to be served. However, we had just gotten off of our flight from Edinburgh to Paris which we had not drunk on. This flight was delayed. We were unable to make use of any of the time in the airport lounge which had been included in our flight upgrade, so hadn't had anything to drink during our time through CDG either.  Also, this doesn't even include WiFi. Secondly, at check in we were unable to upgrade on our return as the flight was full. When I discussed the delay on our last flight and our missed opportunity to utilise the lounge included with our previous upgrade she shrugged and said she didn't know and I should ask someone else. The food was bad with no in flight options provided. Only veggie, with both main and side vegetables overcooked. There is zero quality for the economy class customer experience which is ironic considering they were the most expensive of the three airline options between us and our guests who either flew British Airways or Qatar. We paid (not including our upgrade) £650 per adult return in comparison to £600 for BA and £500 for Qatar (all EDI to JHB). And again, despite being the most expensive, this included no checked baggage. Finally, my decision to never fly Sky Team again was cemented when I realised that I had not packed my toothpaste into my hand luggage on the economy fight back, so asked a stewardess if I could please have some to brush my teeth. Initially she told me they don't carry any toothpaste on board. When I didn't walk away she finally agreed that yes they do have toothpaste on board in the Business class flight bags but these are only for business class.

I was so happy to see all 3 agents working in ""Priority check in"" free. No customers to serve. I approached one agent, she asked to see my ticket which I showed her. I told her I want to upgrade. She replied, with a stern look, and said ""come back at 7"". The time was 6.15 pm. She would not listen to anything I said thereafter ignoring me as though I did not exist. Another client arrived who was scheduled on an earlier flight, she allowed him to check in an extra luggage for free. I responded by saying that was such a nice gesture on her behalf, and it would be appreciated if that kindness spread to others like me....to please give me a solution. No response. I went to the next agent who was a little more helpful and told me to try the upgrade on the machine. (Even though there were no other customers to serve). I went to the self-operated check in machine and succeed to find the seats I wanted but it would not accept any credit card and redirected me to the counter. I went back, again all 3 agents were free. They said they cannot help. I became angry. Another client came with the same situation. Yet that client had already her business class tickets. She was treated the same way. She said she had “never” seen such service. Ok now its 7pm. I am waiting to enter priority check in-no one is there to serve the clients!

Please I need to understand! I am on a seven-week European vacation with my husband. I was so happy and then this? Do your clients happiness matter to you? Finally, I wanted their names which they completely refused to give, therefore I photographed them so that you can identify these rude agents and retrain their customer care service skills, or better yet give them a job that they do not have to deal with people.

He asked me if I would prefer cash or miles and I chose cash. I didn't hear from them for a week after I arrived. When I called they told me to file a claim online ""which was supposedly done by the flight attendant onboard"" I filed the claim as requested and I didn't hear back for another 2 weeks and every time I call customer service, they give me stupid excuses until I got so frustrated and asked for a supervisor and they told me they are not allowed to transfer calls to supervisors which makes me wonder what is the job of a supervisor if not to take care of unhappy customers complaints or deal with escalated problems? Finally, after almost 3 weeks, I received an email that they do not offer cash and that the flight attendant was wrong to offer cash! They gave me a voucher for 73 CAD which is 50 Euros and I can use it in 12 months. I replied to the email and told them if they don't provide cash why did they ask for bank information? I received another email that they apologize but there is nothing more they can do.

47,J Smith,Canada,2023-07-27,3,"After an 11 hour flight, then a 6 hour layover in Paris, Air France rejected my boarding pass when scanned for boarding telling me the flight was full and a group of passengers were to fly on the next day's flight, on a ticket and prepaid seat they were fully paid for in advance. I had to spend the night in Paris airport hotel and wait for the next day's flight to Yerevan. Air France without notice to it's passengers' to increase their profit margins had decided to fly a smaller plane to Yerevan on July 25th, without having concern for leaving their passengers and their luggage behind. Air France supervisor finally after all their passengers had boarded showed up without apology threatening the furious passengers with police. Fortunately the French police was more civil than Air France supervisor, they stayed out of Air France dirty laundry and left them to sort the mess. Finally when some of the passengers were given seats their carry on luggage was checked in and the checked in luggage left behind. Without compensations a claim was filed on their site but the site did not allow for a delivery address. Two days later AF called telling me I had to pick up my luggage at the airport when I had included a primary residence address on the claim. Apparently I had not provided a local phone number and my international cell phone number was not acceptable for a local delivery. When contacted the Local Yerevan Air France office the sales desk agent was just as loud and rude as the supervisor in Paris. Not once they showed remorse for their lack of professionalism or showed customer service. I presume Air France agents are trained in finding obstacles instead of solutions, Have no concern the stress and health risk they pause to the passengers with their irresponsible behavior, pass the buck and scream loud to silence the exhausted passengers instead of listening.

52,S Garseeram,France,2023-07-17,2,"I booked 2 business class tickets for myself and my 2 year old daughter. A few weeks before my flight, I called Air France to check on the seating and meal arrangements for my daughter to ensure everything is confirmed. The 2nd time I called Air France was the day before my flight to make sure again if the seating and meals were confirmed. Both occasions, I was given the assurance that my daughter's child meal was confirmed and for seating, it is a priority she is in the appropriate seat next to me. During the flight, the attendant came to me and said the child meal was not booked when I did it 2 times. The 2nd issue is my seat was faulty.  I only realized when I was extending the seat, that it jammed and couldn't become a bed. I got off to check and saw my daughter's foot was stuck in this big gap as you see in the picture, by the metal piece stretching across the seat. This piece was visible and the cushion was falling off. I called the attendant and she quickly informed the chief steward who came and pulled the cushion away to seal it back to cover the metal piece.  Throughout the flight, the cushion kept sliding and I had to get off the seat to refit the cushion. Before landing, I couldn't fully recline the seat back to original position because of this big issue. The attendant had to put in a lot of strength to ensure the cushions fit correctly while reclining the seat. Finally it went back to original position but the belt was stuck and I couldn't pull it to secure myself for the landing. I had to sit on my daughter's seat with her on my lap for the landing. I filed a complaint to Air France, I wanted to cancel my return flight to book on another airline. This is what they responded. ""Thank you for your remarks concerning the special child meal you booked and your seat on your flight from Marseille to Singapore on July 10. Our staff reported that you were unhappy with your seat and inspected the seat. They found no defect or fault with the seat, for which reason I cannot issue any compensation in this case.

The flight lasted under two hours however, the proper business cabin service was still offered. A cold towel pre-flight, and a full gourmet meal as soon as we reached cruising altitude.

54,J Anderson,United States,2023-07-16,10,"I am extremely impressed with the business class product on this international flight. The airplane has been in service for 24 years, but extremely well-kept. We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments. Really? You get upset because the delay is a safety issue that they are trying to fix before we take off on a 9 hour flight? Thank you Air France for ensuring that safety came first. I would have gladly waited as long as I had to! Once up in the air, the business class service was nothing short of stellar, the meals were all gourmet by a three star, Michelin Chef, the in-flight crew was warm, welcoming, personable, and genuine. I have to say that after this experience, the business class product on Air France for me, comes in at number 2. Qatar obviously still holds the 1st place for me. This airplane had been upgraded to the new business class configurations 1-2-1. I had a window seat (7A) and even though overall, I am not a big fan of the new “business class pods” industry wide, the seat was very comfortable with plenty of storage, and the entertainment options were very good. Amenity kit, headphones, a very nice pillow and duvet were also offered in business class. One thing I loved about Air France is that they give you free Wi-Fi to send text messages via ‎WhatsApp, Messenger, iMessage, and a few other messaging platforms, so you really do not need to purchase an Internet package unless you want to stream. The Internet on this flight worked from gate to gate without interruption of service. Overall, next time I go to Europe, I will most definitely have Air France on my top list.

55,P Jackson,United States,2023-07-16,1,"Air France is a terrible airline with deceptive advertising and unresponsive customer service. We remain without fair compensation ($100 offered off a future flight). They made a significant change to my flight itinerary that I deem as an unfair or deceptive practice. The departing inflight entertainment service did not work for all three passengers. We were not informed until the flight was in the air, or we would have re-booked with a proper flight. Furthermore, I purchased these tickets with the promise that we would be served the menu prepared by Chef Mashama Bailey (our co-chef through the James Beard Foundation), but I received horrid food that was still frozen, not her menu or as advertised. Additionally, the staff lied numerous times when questioned if the food was vegetarian, they said yes – only to come back and inform me that they served eggs with chicken. We are strict vegetarians, which caused harm. On the return flight from Paris to JFK, again, I purchased the beauty of an Air France flight with all of its luxury and had a significant change of my flight itinerary that I deem unfair or deceptive practice to a Delta Flight. This flight lacked the services, food by Chef Mashama Bailey (or the Delta Business Class menu – we were served the economy class menu), wine, airplane, and staff that was purchased.

56,Leonardo Cunha,Germany,2023-07-09,1,"I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent flight experience with Air France. Unfortunately, my trip was marked by a significant delay, inadequate accommodations, and disproportionate treatment regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. First and foremost, my flight experienced a 2-hour delay, which resulted in a missed connecting flight at CDG to AJA and disrupted my plans. The lack of effective communication and frequent updates on the flight status only exacerbated my frustration and discomfort throughout the waiting period. Furthermore, the accommodations provided by Air France were extremely disappointing. The hotel where I was accommodated was of inferior quality, with poor conditions and lack of air conditioning. The unbearable heat made my stay even more unsatisfactory and affected my rest before continuing with the journey. Lastly, I would like to mention the excessively strict attitude regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. I was surprised by a severe reprimand from the airline staff due to just 700 grams over the limit in my carry-on bag, even though it was the same bag I boarded with in MUC. This disproportionate approach and disrespectful treatment left me extremely disappointed with the service provided. As a customer, I expected a comfortable and professional flight experience, but unfortunately, Air France did not meet my expectations. I request that you review your customer service policies with the aim of preventing other passengers from going through similar experiences in the future. As a result of this negative experience, I categorically state that I do not intend to fly with Air France again.

59,Pieter Scholtz,South Africa,2023-07-03,1,"I have flown with Air France regularly because it is the only direct flight from South Africa to France where I study. I have always been surprised by how poor the food and service are on the route I take, but my last trip took Air France's utter disregard for passengers to a new level. After the plane was in Johannesburg for a whole day (available to be inspected and to make sure that everything on the plane was working) the flight got cancelled when we were already all boarded and ready to go when the pilot announced an issue with the air conditioning system. Even though I believe this was ridiculous already given all the time they had to check the plane, the worst was yet to come. The pilot gave a very unsympathetic announcement after we were sitting on the plane for two hours already that the flight is cancelled. Nothing else. The cabin crew advised us that the ground crew will assist us. Except that there were no ground crew when we got off the plane. One lady behind an obscure desk had no idea what was going on and a gent with her merely said to all the passengers that they should sort themselves out with accommodation, food and travel to the accommodation and then claim back. If all of this was already ridiculous, the worse was yet to come: trying to process a claim is a nightmare! Air France booked me on another flight 3 days later - without any correspondence with me. If I had taken this flight I would not have been able to graduate this year as I would've missed a key class in my studies. I urgently had to book another flight via Kenya to get to France in time for my classes. The whole process was so badly done that it proofed impossible to cancel the substitute flight without cancelling my return flight as well. There was no way of contacting anybody at Air France to assist in cancelling the replacement flight, but not cancel the return flight. No way to phone or e-mail. Air France doesn't even have an office area in Johannesburg where one can ask for assistance. The website is terrible and the AI used clearly doesn't cope with anything that is not stock standard. I am still struggling to try and process my claim. I have still not managed to connect with anybody at Air France that can assist to sort out the cancelling of the replacement flight. They claim you can connect with them on Messenger or Twitter, but don't be fooled, the AI chat bot doesn't work well and the supposed operators don't contact you as promised by the chat bot.

62,S Nemec,Czech Republic,2023-06-26,1,"Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don’t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it’s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company.

The line got very long, between the weighting line, the hold line, and the check in line, and I almost lost the boarding time.

65,vincent pace,United States,2023-06-19,2,"First a comment about Premium Economy on Air France. It's a joke. I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a ""Property Irregularity Report."" Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags.

67,D Aksoy,Turkey,2023-06-06,2,"Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges.

73,Christian Hiller,France,2023-05-17,1,"Problems encountered during my trip on flight AF655 on April 14th from Dubai to Paris. Due to the health issues of the captain we had to make an emergency landing in Vienna, where we were disembarked by bus at Terminal 3 around 4 am. Upon arriving at the terminal an airport employee told us to go to the Air France counter at Terminal 1. At the counter, the hostess told us to go back to Terminal 3, where an Air France hostess would assist us. So we returned to Terminal 3 (after spending over an hour queuing at security) to once again find no Air France representative. I called Air France customer service multiple times, asking to be transferred to another flight (there were over 6 Vienna-Paris flights in the morning, including 3 Air France flights with available seats, as I checked on the internet). After being told that a seat was being reserved for me on the 10:05 a.m. flight, I was later informed that it was no longer possible but that I would be called back. I never received a call back, and despite my reminders, no solution or alternative was ever offered to me, nor was I kept informed. I spent over 10 hours in Terminal 3 during which time I was never contacted or met with an Air France representative, and I was never kept informed about the progress in resolving the issue.

93,Paul Mercer,United Kingdom,2023-02-21,10,"Boarding was done efficiently with Sky Priority/Business passengers allowed on first. It was a nearly-new A350 and looked immaculate. We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline.

94,S Galantian,United States,2023-02-16,1,"AF 072 flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to LAX. US passport holders have an extra long line to weigh their baggage. The person weighing the baggage before this flight asked the passenger ahead of me in line to weigh her bags. When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ‘It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in’.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed.

After completing check-in, I noticed that my bag tag was completely illegible because the printer was running out of ink. I returned to the check-in counter where I approached an agent who appeared to be lead agent on duty that night. I asked him in French if my bag tag can please be reprinted as it was unreadable. He started yelling at me (in French), ""Who did you see when you checked in...go to that person"". I stopped all proceedings and firmly responded, ""Why are you speaking to me like that!?"". He then told me curtly that the bag had already been sent for loading onto the aircraft. I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted. He continued to give me rude responses, at which point I told him to go into the system and find my baggage tag number and write it legibly on my boarding pass.

Unfortunately my ATL-JFK flight was delayed, which would cause me to miss the connecting flight to LIS. Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""? I was trying to inquire if she was looking at my ATL to JFK portion of fare as I actually paid 3 times as much for my round trip. After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me.

105,N Yavonych,Germany,2023-01-10,10,"HAM to CDG and return. Two short hops of 70 min each. Purchasing ticket and options via AF app was a breeze. Same for online check in. All was easy, clear and working well. At both airports I used self-serviced bag drop-off. You come to the unmanned kiosk, scan your boarding pass, then it prints your bag tag, you attach it to a bag, place the bag on the belt, scan the tag and your bag is checked. At both stations it didn’t take me more than 3 minutes with zero queuing time. At the same time queuing to normal check in desks would have taken good 20 minutes (also quite bearable if you arrive on time). My first flight was delayed by 1 hour. The delay was managed perfectly. Push notification and email on the mobile phone with new estimated boarding time and gate number, instant update of the boarding pass via app and proper announcement at the gate. Inflight information on missed and rescheduled connections was sufficient and clear. In the air they have managed to serve small snack with round if drinks (tea, coffee, soda, beer, wine). I purchased inflight internet access. The price was ok, speed was fine for browsing websites. If you need just messaging you can get a free plan for the whole duration of your flight. Cabin was clean and fresh (brand new A220) with reasonable comfort. On the way back it was HOP (regional subsidiary of AF) with older E190.

107,M Garela,Czech Republic,2023-01-08,2,"Our baggage did not make the destination airport. Air France told me initially that I will get them the day after (today) - which I have been told is no longer the case, right now I already expect them tomorrow. I live in the Czech Republic and I have spent 1 month in Spain. I had to take casual and business clothes with me, as well as gym clothes. As a consequence, I do not have clothes to work tomorrow, neither for my gym session. Additionally, I have my winter jacket in the missing baggage. Being in Prague and being in winter, I can not go anywhere without it. For this reason, I am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so I can make it through the day tomorrow. Air France does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say I have a permanent, and not a temporary address. I do not care what the policy say, this is going to cost me money and make me waste time. Being such a well known company, I trusted Air France. The whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport, where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come. Then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk.

108,K Morton,Spain,2022-12-16,3,"I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden.

136,S Simpson,United Kingdom,2022-09-07,2,"Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available!

However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag.

139,Randy Nunez,United States,2022-08-26,10,"I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day.

143,J Meeres,United States,2022-08-13,1,They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage.

145,L Karson,United States,2022-08-09,6,"We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back.

149,Y Burns,Canada,2022-08-02,1,"Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed.

151,A Marler,Germany,2022-08-01,1,"During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed.

AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was.

155,M Shaw,United States,2022-07-24,1,"We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you.

159,Michael Little,Australia,2022-07-18,7,"Online check-in and bag drop at Heathrow were straightforward, but the boarding procedure was cumbersome due to an apparent shortage of people at the gate (only 1 for most of the time). A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks).

The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter).

176,C Barker,United States,2022-06-26,1,"My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety.

I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !!

186,Andrew Zweng,United States,2022-06-14,2,"Delayed on initial flight for both our departure and return trips. This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent.

Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong.

195,E Victor,Netherlands,2022-05-22,1,"Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle).

196,M Papadaki,United Kingdom,2022-05-22,3,"Very poor meals for a 10hour flight (Paris CDG to Havana). They provided one meal ~1.5 hours after the take off and then we were starving as the last one was ~1.5 before landing. Both were unsatisfactory for such a long flight, equal to those offered in 3 hour flights of other airlines such Aegean. Also one of the flight attendants woke us up (4 people) at 4.30am while everyone was sleeping because she wanted to find her bag. She first opened the cases above our seats and after she realized that her bag was not there she poked the person sitting on the outermost seat to ask where is the bag and “why” it’s not there, loudly and visibly annoyed. So rude. For the record, the bag was in the next (front) case but I guess it’s easier to ask someone instead of looking a little further.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Havana,May 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2,no,False,Paris,Havana,,Negative,-0.8126,  poor meal 10hour paris cdg havana provide one meal hour take starve last one land unsatisfactory long equal offer 3 hour flight airline aegean one attendant wake us 4 people everyone sleep want find bag first open case seat realize bag poke person sit outermost seat ask bag loudly visibly annoyed rude record bag next front case guess easy ask someone instead look little
197,N Kamerry,Canada,2022-05-18,2,"Delayed take-off by two hours from YYZ. Having waited for a while in Mumbai for my suitcase, I finally made it to the counter to file a claim.  It took me 4 hours to get out of the airport trying to file a claim for the missing baggage. The Air France representative  Mr. Akash was nothing but polite, courteous, and a star that worked under pressure. Whilst the process was disorganized and lacked manpower, he was single-handedly managing AF travelers.  I hope they track and manage to deliver my luggage on time.

198,Derek Chinn,United States,2022-05-15,1,Paris CDG to Los Angeles. The worst flight I have ever been on in my entire life. We were given one meal at the start of our 11 hour flight about 1 hour in to the flight. The staff then provided nothing in the way of drinks or snacks for the next 9 hours. It was inhumane. No one should fly with this company and force them all to close.,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris CDG to Los Angeles,May 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,1,no,False,Paris CDG,Los Angeles,,Negative,-0.6249,  paris cdg los angeles worst ever entire life give one meal start 11 hour 1 hour staff provide nothing way drink snack next 9 hour inhumane one fly company force close
199,C Marham,New Caledonia,2022-05-09,4,"Paris to Amsterdam with Air France, KLM from Amsterdam to Tokyo and AirCalin from Tokyo to Noumea. I had so many issues, I am not sure where to start! First, my return flight from Paris to Noumea was changed so many times, I lost track, but it was at least 5 times. At least two times, they cancelled one leg only, but did not provide further information as to alternative flights. Other times, they provided an inconvenient alternative, and then it was almost impossible to reach a real person to select a viable alternative (3-4 days ""chatting"" through facebook - like a bad combination of email and chatting). After our last change, we got a new e-ticket and itinerary, only they never updated the real times. And we never got a message telling us that the flight had changed. As you usually do, we trusted the itinerary that they had sent, but we got to the airport just in time to get in. Lucky we had decided to get to the airport 4 hours before the flight, rather than 3. After running all over the airport, and no support whatsoever to get through the security checks, we made it just in time to board the plane - only to be seated and wait for an extra hour before the plane actually took off - because they decided to check the covid requirements during boarding! They found one person without the requirements, and then we all had to wait for the poor luggage staff to find this person's baggage inside the plane and remove it!",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Amsterdam,May 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,,1,no,True,Paris,Amsterdam,,Positive,0.7767,  paris amsterdam air klm amsterdam tokyo aircalin tokyo noumea many issue sure start first return paris noumea change many time lose track least 5 time least two time cancel one leg provide information alternative flight time provide inconvenient alternative almost impossible reach real person select viable alternative day chat facebook like bad combination email chat last change get new itinerary never update real time never get message tell us change usually trust itinerary sent get airport time get lucky decided get airport 4 hour rather 3 run airport support whatsoever get security check make time board seat wait extra hour actually take decided check covid requirement board find one person without requirement wait poor luggage staff find person baggage inside remove
