0,L Neiman,United States,2023-11-15,1,"Air France lost our three bags, someone was in my seat on the plane. The woman who tried to help us fill out forms about our missing bags could barely use the touch screen, so we had to do it for her completely. We had to wait more than three hours after we got off the plane to get our bags at our destination after they were left in Paris (our layover). The aircraft’s wheels were exceptionally squeaky, and they screeched loudly constantly while we were on the ramp. Also, the food was terrible. It was a sloppy cream cheese and cucumber “sandwich”. It was barely edible. They forced us to check our bags in the first case despite there being plenty of open seats and thus, room to carry our bags onto the plane like normal.

1,Derek Northcutt,United States,2023-11-15,2,"Very disappointing and that has become the normal experience with Air France. Poor catering on board, and on a nine-hour flight no one came to offer more drinks. I went to the back to fetch my own but found that the cabin crew had sealed off our compartment (limiting 16 rows to one toilet) with locked curtains, so they can be alone. Upon arrival, there was no wheelchair for me (and this happens all the time at CDG airport). I have an artificial leg and it is difficult for me to walk long distances, yet they have me walk up the boarding bridge to the lobby, then walk outside to catch their van, where it drops you off at another terminals and you have to walk up steps and then an elevator and then a longish walk to where they have their wheelchair staff. If you wish to fly with this group, choose KLM who are efficient, they have wheelchairs available when you arrive, take you to where you want to go. We flew to Bucharest, and there has never been a wheelchair waiting for me so I guess they do not do that there. My last three trips with AF/KLM have resulted in delayed suitcases of up to a week.

4,C Huang,United States,2023-11-09,1,I’ve been on “bad” airlines and even though the amenities may be lacking the customer service was at least decent. This cannot be said for Air France. After struggling to find room to store my luggage I had to squeeze my way up and ask the flight attendant for assistance. She told me “you need to figure that out yourself” along with “I don’t know how to help you”. I kept telling her that I wasn’t able to find bin space and that I needed help moving stuff out of the way (I’m 4’11 I can barely reach the bins) along with lifting my suitcase into a bin but she kept saying “you need to figure it out on your own”.

5,Catalin Alexandru Glavan,Switzerland,2023-11-08,3,"I recently booked a round-trip flight from Zurich to Antananarivo with Air France, and the experience was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, it was a series of mishaps and poor service that left me deeply stressed and unsatisfied. The outbound flight from Zurich was delayed by more than 30 minutes. This delay put us in a precarious situation, and we were forced to rush to catch our connecting flight at Paris CDG. The stress of almost missing our connection was certainly not the ideal way to begin a vacation. On the return journey, the problems persisted. The flight from Antananarivo to Paris CDG experienced another significant delay, causing us to miss our initial connection to Amsterdam. While we were rebooked on a later flight, the flight from Paris CDG to Amsterdam was delayed by 30 minutes. In an attempt to ensure we caught our connection in Amsterdam, we requested assistance from a flight attendant, only to be met with a disrespectful attitude and a dismissive response. Upon arriving in Zurich, the troubles continued as our luggage was nowhere to be found. Three of our bags were stuck in Amsterdam, and one in Paris CDG. We were left waiting for over 2 hours and 30 minutes for our luggage from Amsterdam to arrive in Zurich. This was particularly distressing because two of us had another flight scheduled for the following day and were uncertain whether our luggage would make it in time. As a result, we also missed our train connection from Zurich Airport to Thun. To top it all off, the in-flight meals provided by Air France were subpar at best. On the way to Antananarivo, the tomato salad had a rotten taste, and for a 10-hour flight, the meal options were shockingly limited. On the return journey, the meals were disappointing, with the second meal consisting of bread with some sauce, a cold mini croissant, a jam, and a yogurt. In summary, my experience with Air France on this trip was marred by delays, unhelpful staff, lost luggage, and inadequate in-flight meals.  I expected better service and reliability for the price I paid, and this experience fell far short of those expectations.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Antanarivo to Zurich via Paris,November 2023,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2,no,True,Antanarivo,Zurich,Paris,Negative,-0.9839,  recently book zurich antananarivo air experience nothing short nightmare start finish series mishap poor service leave deeply stress unsatisfied outbound zurich delay 30 minute delay put us precarious situation force rush catch connect paris cdg stress almost miss connection certainly ideal way begin vacation return journey problem persist antananarivo paris cdg experience another significant delay cause us miss initial connection amsterdam rebooked later paris cdg amsterdam delayed 30 minute attempt ensure caught connection amsterdam request assistance attendant meet disrespectful attitude dismissive response upon arrive zurich trouble continue luggage nowhere find three bag stick amsterdam one paris cdg leave wait 2 hour 30 minute luggage amsterdam arrive zurich particularly distress two us another schedule follow day uncertain whether luggage make time result miss train connection zurich airport thun top meal provide air subpar best way antananarivo tomato salad rotten taste meal option shockingly limited return journey meal disappointing second meal consist bread sauce cold mini croissant jam yogurt summary experience air trip mar delay unhelpful staff lose luggage inadequate meal expect good service reliability price pay experience fell far short expectation

9,Jennifer Morrison,United States,2023-11-01,3,"I fly Air France frequently to and from French Polynesia and can honestly say I have always had a great experience. My most recent was however not a pleasant one. Neither leg of my roundtrip flight was enjoyable and felt like more of a budget airline. We are frequent travelers and book specific seats. we know which seats are not good. a month before they changed planes, and we were forced into seats that we would not have choose as they do not recline as much as the rest of that class. Well, we were stuck and had no other seats to move too. On top of that my seat was broken and the footrest could not be used. So not only did I have a seat that did not recline like the rest now I had a broken footrest. The only option was to move to a middle seat away from my family and sit by strangers. I might have just sat in economy because the premium was really not premium. The staff is amazing as always and so very nice, but wow the food was absolutely horrific on both flights.

We boarded on time at 3.30pm for a 4.05pm departure from BEY to CDG, and shortly after pushing back we were informed of a technical problem. We returned to the gate and were told one hour later that it was fixed. However shortly after pushing back again, the pilot announced the problem was still not fixed and that the plane's radar was out of order. We were then offered to fly to Athens as the weather there was good and ""didn't require a radar"". Another AF flight would then take us to Paris. However half the passengers decided to leave the plane. I decided to stay but after more than 5 hours, we were still stuck in the plane with no food or drink served. Then the pilot said the flight was canceled because the weather had changed! A hostess started shouting at us with conflicting instructions about disembarking and then returning to our seats - a complete chaos with children crying. After disembarking it was a total mess a no one knew on which flight they would be rebooked. We ended being sent to a cheap hotel at midnight. It was impossible to get any help from AF's call center as it is based in North Africa and their totally useless staff were not even able to provide accurate information (they said there was no flight before 2 days later while I managed to get a booking the next day by talking directly to the airport staff).

Only one hot meal was served after take off (despite the 14-hour flight duration due to Russian airspace restrictions).

No power socket, only USB plugs - quite unacceptable for Premium Economy. No wifi.

After scrambling around the airport for hours, we found someone to speak to who managed to get us on the original flight and a new flight leaving from Paris, with a delay of 2 hours.

14,J Borgen,United States,2023-10-14,3,"Strike among air controllers in Paris caused particular problems due to delays. Sitting in an Air France plane waiting during delayed boarding is torture given the NOISE that is played. Made by a 12 year old who knows three chords and got his hands on a synthesizer? Awful. Same mind numbing noise if you call AF. Flying in “comfort” Premium Economy for $3,660 RT is horrendously overpriced given the food and lack of attention. This was a fairly common Business Class fare. Except for a seat that is less uncomfortable than in economy and a pouch with a toothbrush etc., there is nothing to justify the price difference. Dinners were served, both ways, with a main dish in a rectangular box hidden in mashed potatoes. Return flight I chose duck. Sounds nice, right? More like pre- chewed something mixed with, or hidden underneath, mashed potatoes. On neither flight (to and from Paris) did anybody stop to ask if I would like another wine or more water. No drinks before dinner. Nothing to differentiate this “Premium class” from economy. Stewards steamed backwards with cart returning from economy without so much as looking sideways to quickly reach the sanctity of the galley between business class and the Premium Economy. You will not get any kind of service or attention that differentiates you from those in economy seats. It may be Air France’s intention that there should be a difference, but I have on my three flights with AF this year seen none of it! None. While there are three or four bathrooms provided for business class in front of you, you will in the Premium section have longest walk to a bathroom of any passenger onboard. True! As I saw that many passengers (especially couples) are in their 60s and 70s this is another reason this Premium section does not warrant its price. The walk back through the economy section in the dark with pillows, blankets, and feet in the way is no fun. In reaching the very back of the plane there were three thin brown sandwiches in a large box waiting, together with a few chewable candies also in a large box and two stewardesses far less interested in engaging with a passenger than in talking among themselves. And it is especially here that KLM has a leg up on Air France. More often, but not always, do KLM personnel seem more friendly and engaging. With reference to my observations in the above, try KLM premium and compare for yourself. The Air France lounge is nice, but if given the opportunity, check out KLM’s main lounge in Amsterdam. Also very nice. Conclusion, suffer economy for 8.5 to 10.5 hours and treat yourself (with the significant amount of money not wasted) to a nicer hotel and great and expensive meal upon arrival! And, on this particular flight, you will guaranteed be closer to bathroom if you book an economy seat!

18,R Habasi,Morocco,2023-10-02,1,"Disappointing Business Class Experience on Air France. My wife and I recently flew with Air France in business class from Rabat to Manchester, with a connecting flight in Paris. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience that did not meet our expectations. On September 28, we boarded our flight from Rabat to Paris. The business class seats were barely an upgrade from economy, with limited recline and lacking amenities. The meal service was lacking - a small cold pasta salad and no appetizer or dessert. Upon arriving at CDG, there was no priority boarding or fast track security for business class passengers. We waited in a long queue for 35 minutes to board our connecting flight to Manchester. Again, the business class meal was mediocre - a small cold sandwich. On our return journey on October 1, we decided to fly economy class. Our flight from Manchester departed 15 minutes late. We were anxious about missing our connection in Paris due to the delay. The food was disappointing. Our flight landed in Paris 25 minutes late, giving us under 40 minutes to catch our connection to Rabat. We rushed through the airport and reached the gate just in time. However, upon landing in Rabat, we were informed that our checked luggage had been left behind in Paris. We had to return to the airport at 11:30pm when Air France sent the bags on a later flight.

The flight was delayed and we were stuck on the tarmac for 3 hours with no adequate food or drinks. Truly awful experience. Then they lost our bags containing clothes and gifts for the wedding. The bags arrived 3 days late damaged. They have not compensated us for the damage! They had a major server breakdown and communication via the website was impossible. We were told they lost 15,000 bags that day. The office in Kinshasa could not access any systems to register our loss but told us they would register on our behalf.

21,H Martin,United Kingdom,2023-09-21,1,"The quality of Air France is disgraceful to the point I won't fly any sky alliance flights again. We were flying back to Johannesburg for our wedding and so wanted the experience to be slightly more special. Paid for an upgrade to business class at the airport for Paris to JHB. Firstly, we received better drinks service in economy coming back than going out in business class. After our boarding drink was poured and we were in the air I asked if I could get a drink, twice, to once be told they would be with me soon, and when we were still ignored my partner then asked for a whiskey and he was told you can wait till after dinner. I understand that if you have been drinking prior to your flight and appear intoxicated, then you are not going to be served. However, we had just gotten off of our flight from Edinburgh to Paris which we had not drunk on. This flight was delayed. We were unable to make use of any of the time in the airport lounge which had been included in our flight upgrade, so hadn't had anything to drink during our time through CDG either.  Also, this doesn't even include WiFi. Secondly, at check in we were unable to upgrade on our return as the flight was full. When I discussed the delay on our last flight and our missed opportunity to utilise the lounge included with our previous upgrade she shrugged and said she didn't know and I should ask someone else. The food was bad with no in flight options provided. Only veggie, with both main and side vegetables overcooked. There is zero quality for the economy class customer experience which is ironic considering they were the most expensive of the three airline options between us and our guests who either flew British Airways or Qatar. We paid (not including our upgrade) £650 per adult return in comparison to £600 for BA and £500 for Qatar (all EDI to JHB). And again, despite being the most expensive, this included no checked baggage. Finally, my decision to never fly Sky Team again was cemented when I realised that I had not packed my toothpaste into my hand luggage on the economy fight back, so asked a stewardess if I could please have some to brush my teeth. Initially she told me they don't carry any toothpaste on board. When I didn't walk away she finally agreed that yes they do have toothpaste on board in the Business class flight bags but these are only for business class.

I was so happy to see all 3 agents working in ""Priority check in"" free. No customers to serve. I approached one agent, she asked to see my ticket which I showed her. I told her I want to upgrade. She replied, with a stern look, and said ""come back at 7"". The time was 6.15 pm. She would not listen to anything I said thereafter ignoring me as though I did not exist. Another client arrived who was scheduled on an earlier flight, she allowed him to check in an extra luggage for free. I responded by saying that was such a nice gesture on her behalf, and it would be appreciated if that kindness spread to others like me....to please give me a solution. No response. I went to the next agent who was a little more helpful and told me to try the upgrade on the machine. (Even though there were no other customers to serve). I went to the self-operated check in machine and succeed to find the seats I wanted but it would not accept any credit card and redirected me to the counter. I went back, again all 3 agents were free. They said they cannot help. I became angry. Another client came with the same situation. Yet that client had already her business class tickets. She was treated the same way. She said she had “never” seen such service. Ok now its 7pm. I am waiting to enter priority check in-no one is there to serve the clients!

Please I need to understand! I am on a seven-week European vacation with my husband. I was so happy and then this? Do your clients happiness matter to you? Finally, I wanted their names which they completely refused to give, therefore I photographed them so that you can identify these rude agents and retrain their customer care service skills, or better yet give them a job that they do not have to deal with people.

He asked me if I would prefer cash or miles and I chose cash. I didn't hear from them for a week after I arrived. When I called they told me to file a claim online ""which was supposedly done by the flight attendant onboard"" I filed the claim as requested and I didn't hear back for another 2 weeks and every time I call customer service, they give me stupid excuses until I got so frustrated and asked for a supervisor and they told me they are not allowed to transfer calls to supervisors which makes me wonder what is the job of a supervisor if not to take care of unhappy customers complaints or deal with escalated problems? Finally, after almost 3 weeks, I received an email that they do not offer cash and that the flight attendant was wrong to offer cash! They gave me a voucher for 73 CAD which is 50 Euros and I can use it in 12 months. I replied to the email and told them if they don't provide cash why did they ask for bank information? I received another email that they apologize but there is nothing more they can do.

47,J Smith,Canada,2023-07-27,3,"After an 11 hour flight, then a 6 hour layover in Paris, Air France rejected my boarding pass when scanned for boarding telling me the flight was full and a group of passengers were to fly on the next day's flight, on a ticket and prepaid seat they were fully paid for in advance. I had to spend the night in Paris airport hotel and wait for the next day's flight to Yerevan. Air France without notice to it's passengers' to increase their profit margins had decided to fly a smaller plane to Yerevan on July 25th, without having concern for leaving their passengers and their luggage behind. Air France supervisor finally after all their passengers had boarded showed up without apology threatening the furious passengers with police. Fortunately the French police was more civil than Air France supervisor, they stayed out of Air France dirty laundry and left them to sort the mess. Finally when some of the passengers were given seats their carry on luggage was checked in and the checked in luggage left behind. Without compensations a claim was filed on their site but the site did not allow for a delivery address. Two days later AF called telling me I had to pick up my luggage at the airport when I had included a primary residence address on the claim. Apparently I had not provided a local phone number and my international cell phone number was not acceptable for a local delivery. When contacted the Local Yerevan Air France office the sales desk agent was just as loud and rude as the supervisor in Paris. Not once they showed remorse for their lack of professionalism or showed customer service. I presume Air France agents are trained in finding obstacles instead of solutions, Have no concern the stress and health risk they pause to the passengers with their irresponsible behavior, pass the buck and scream loud to silence the exhausted passengers instead of listening.

52,S Garseeram,France,2023-07-17,2,"I booked 2 business class tickets for myself and my 2 year old daughter. A few weeks before my flight, I called Air France to check on the seating and meal arrangements for my daughter to ensure everything is confirmed. The 2nd time I called Air France was the day before my flight to make sure again if the seating and meals were confirmed. Both occasions, I was given the assurance that my daughter's child meal was confirmed and for seating, it is a priority she is in the appropriate seat next to me. During the flight, the attendant came to me and said the child meal was not booked when I did it 2 times. The 2nd issue is my seat was faulty.  I only realized when I was extending the seat, that it jammed and couldn't become a bed. I got off to check and saw my daughter's foot was stuck in this big gap as you see in the picture, by the metal piece stretching across the seat. This piece was visible and the cushion was falling off. I called the attendant and she quickly informed the chief steward who came and pulled the cushion away to seal it back to cover the metal piece.  Throughout the flight, the cushion kept sliding and I had to get off the seat to refit the cushion. Before landing, I couldn't fully recline the seat back to original position because of this big issue. The attendant had to put in a lot of strength to ensure the cushions fit correctly while reclining the seat. Finally it went back to original position but the belt was stuck and I couldn't pull it to secure myself for the landing. I had to sit on my daughter's seat with her on my lap for the landing. I filed a complaint to Air France, I wanted to cancel my return flight to book on another airline. This is what they responded. ""Thank you for your remarks concerning the special child meal you booked and your seat on your flight from Marseille to Singapore on July 10. Our staff reported that you were unhappy with your seat and inspected the seat. They found no defect or fault with the seat, for which reason I cannot issue any compensation in this case.

The flight lasted under two hours however, the proper business cabin service was still offered. A cold towel pre-flight, and a full gourmet meal as soon as we reached cruising altitude.

54,J Anderson,United States,2023-07-16,10,"I am extremely impressed with the business class product on this international flight. The airplane has been in service for 24 years, but extremely well-kept. We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments. Really? You get upset because the delay is a safety issue that they are trying to fix before we take off on a 9 hour flight? Thank you Air France for ensuring that safety came first. I would have gladly waited as long as I had to! Once up in the air, the business class service was nothing short of stellar, the meals were all gourmet by a three star, Michelin Chef, the in-flight crew was warm, welcoming, personable, and genuine. I have to say that after this experience, the business class product on Air France for me, comes in at number 2. Qatar obviously still holds the 1st place for me. This airplane had been upgraded to the new business class configurations 1-2-1. I had a window seat (7A) and even though overall, I am not a big fan of the new “business class pods” industry wide, the seat was very comfortable with plenty of storage, and the entertainment options were very good. Amenity kit, headphones, a very nice pillow and duvet were also offered in business class. One thing I loved about Air France is that they give you free Wi-Fi to send text messages via ‎WhatsApp, Messenger, iMessage, and a few other messaging platforms, so you really do not need to purchase an Internet package unless you want to stream. The Internet on this flight worked from gate to gate without interruption of service. Overall, next time I go to Europe, I will most definitely have Air France on my top list.

55,P Jackson,United States,2023-07-16,1,"Air France is a terrible airline with deceptive advertising and unresponsive customer service. We remain without fair compensation ($100 offered off a future flight). They made a significant change to my flight itinerary that I deem as an unfair or deceptive practice. The departing inflight entertainment service did not work for all three passengers. We were not informed until the flight was in the air, or we would have re-booked with a proper flight. Furthermore, I purchased these tickets with the promise that we would be served the menu prepared by Chef Mashama Bailey (our co-chef through the James Beard Foundation), but I received horrid food that was still frozen, not her menu or as advertised. Additionally, the staff lied numerous times when questioned if the food was vegetarian, they said yes – only to come back and inform me that they served eggs with chicken. We are strict vegetarians, which caused harm. On the return flight from Paris to JFK, again, I purchased the beauty of an Air France flight with all of its luxury and had a significant change of my flight itinerary that I deem unfair or deceptive practice to a Delta Flight. This flight lacked the services, food by Chef Mashama Bailey (or the Delta Business Class menu – we were served the economy class menu), wine, airplane, and staff that was purchased.

56,Leonardo Cunha,Germany,2023-07-09,1,"I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent flight experience with Air France. Unfortunately, my trip was marked by a significant delay, inadequate accommodations, and disproportionate treatment regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. First and foremost, my flight experienced a 2-hour delay, which resulted in a missed connecting flight at CDG to AJA and disrupted my plans. The lack of effective communication and frequent updates on the flight status only exacerbated my frustration and discomfort throughout the waiting period. Furthermore, the accommodations provided by Air France were extremely disappointing. The hotel where I was accommodated was of inferior quality, with poor conditions and lack of air conditioning. The unbearable heat made my stay even more unsatisfactory and affected my rest before continuing with the journey. Lastly, I would like to mention the excessively strict attitude regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. I was surprised by a severe reprimand from the airline staff due to just 700 grams over the limit in my carry-on bag, even though it was the same bag I boarded with in MUC. This disproportionate approach and disrespectful treatment left me extremely disappointed with the service provided. As a customer, I expected a comfortable and professional flight experience, but unfortunately, Air France did not meet my expectations. I request that you review your customer service policies with the aim of preventing other passengers from going through similar experiences in the future. As a result of this negative experience, I categorically state that I do not intend to fly with Air France again.

59,Pieter Scholtz,South Africa,2023-07-03,1,"I have flown with Air France regularly because it is the only direct flight from South Africa to France where I study. I have always been surprised by how poor the food and service are on the route I take, but my last trip took Air France's utter disregard for passengers to a new level. After the plane was in Johannesburg for a whole day (available to be inspected and to make sure that everything on the plane was working) the flight got cancelled when we were already all boarded and ready to go when the pilot announced an issue with the air conditioning system. Even though I believe this was ridiculous already given all the time they had to check the plane, the worst was yet to come. The pilot gave a very unsympathetic announcement after we were sitting on the plane for two hours already that the flight is cancelled. Nothing else. The cabin crew advised us that the ground crew will assist us. Except that there were no ground crew when we got off the plane. One lady behind an obscure desk had no idea what was going on and a gent with her merely said to all the passengers that they should sort themselves out with accommodation, food and travel to the accommodation and then claim back. If all of this was already ridiculous, the worse was yet to come: trying to process a claim is a nightmare! Air France booked me on another flight 3 days later - without any correspondence with me. If I had taken this flight I would not have been able to graduate this year as I would've missed a key class in my studies. I urgently had to book another flight via Kenya to get to France in time for my classes. The whole process was so badly done that it proofed impossible to cancel the substitute flight without cancelling my return flight as well. There was no way of contacting anybody at Air France to assist in cancelling the replacement flight, but not cancel the return flight. No way to phone or e-mail. Air France doesn't even have an office area in Johannesburg where one can ask for assistance. The website is terrible and the AI used clearly doesn't cope with anything that is not stock standard. I am still struggling to try and process my claim. I have still not managed to connect with anybody at Air France that can assist to sort out the cancelling of the replacement flight. They claim you can connect with them on Messenger or Twitter, but don't be fooled, the AI chat bot doesn't work well and the supposed operators don't contact you as promised by the chat bot.

62,S Nemec,Czech Republic,2023-06-26,1,"Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don’t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it’s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company.

The line got very long, between the weighting line, the hold line, and the check in line, and I almost lost the boarding time.

65,vincent pace,United States,2023-06-19,2,"First a comment about Premium Economy on Air France. It's a joke. I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a ""Property Irregularity Report."" Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags.

67,D Aksoy,Turkey,2023-06-06,2,"Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges.

73,Christian Hiller,France,2023-05-17,1,"Problems encountered during my trip on flight AF655 on April 14th from Dubai to Paris. Due to the health issues of the captain we had to make an emergency landing in Vienna, where we were disembarked by bus at Terminal 3 around 4 am. Upon arriving at the terminal an airport employee told us to go to the Air France counter at Terminal 1. At the counter, the hostess told us to go back to Terminal 3, where an Air France hostess would assist us. So we returned to Terminal 3 (after spending over an hour queuing at security) to once again find no Air France representative. I called Air France customer service multiple times, asking to be transferred to another flight (there were over 6 Vienna-Paris flights in the morning, including 3 Air France flights with available seats, as I checked on the internet). After being told that a seat was being reserved for me on the 10:05 a.m. flight, I was later informed that it was no longer possible but that I would be called back. I never received a call back, and despite my reminders, no solution or alternative was ever offered to me, nor was I kept informed. I spent over 10 hours in Terminal 3 during which time I was never contacted or met with an Air France representative, and I was never kept informed about the progress in resolving the issue.

93,Paul Mercer,United Kingdom,2023-02-21,10,"Boarding was done efficiently with Sky Priority/Business passengers allowed on first. It was a nearly-new A350 and looked immaculate. We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline.

94,S Galantian,United States,2023-02-16,1,"AF 072 flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle to LAX. US passport holders have an extra long line to weigh their baggage. The person weighing the baggage before this flight asked the passenger ahead of me in line to weigh her bags. When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ‘It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in’.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed.

After completing check-in, I noticed that my bag tag was completely illegible because the printer was running out of ink. I returned to the check-in counter where I approached an agent who appeared to be lead agent on duty that night. I asked him in French if my bag tag can please be reprinted as it was unreadable. He started yelling at me (in French), ""Who did you see when you checked in...go to that person"". I stopped all proceedings and firmly responded, ""Why are you speaking to me like that!?"". He then told me curtly that the bag had already been sent for loading onto the aircraft. I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted. He continued to give me rude responses, at which point I told him to go into the system and find my baggage tag number and write it legibly on my boarding pass.

Unfortunately my ATL-JFK flight was delayed, which would cause me to miss the connecting flight to LIS. Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""? I was trying to inquire if she was looking at my ATL to JFK portion of fare as I actually paid 3 times as much for my round trip. After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me.

105,N Yavonych,Germany,2023-01-10,10,"HAM to CDG and return. Two short hops of 70 min each. Purchasing ticket and options via AF app was a breeze. Same for online check in. All was easy, clear and working well. At both airports I used self-serviced bag drop-off. You come to the unmanned kiosk, scan your boarding pass, then it prints your bag tag, you attach it to a bag, place the bag on the belt, scan the tag and your bag is checked. At both stations it didn’t take me more than 3 minutes with zero queuing time. At the same time queuing to normal check in desks would have taken good 20 minutes (also quite bearable if you arrive on time). My first flight was delayed by 1 hour. The delay was managed perfectly. Push notification and email on the mobile phone with new estimated boarding time and gate number, instant update of the boarding pass via app and proper announcement at the gate. Inflight information on missed and rescheduled connections was sufficient and clear. In the air they have managed to serve small snack with round if drinks (tea, coffee, soda, beer, wine). I purchased inflight internet access. The price was ok, speed was fine for browsing websites. If you need just messaging you can get a free plan for the whole duration of your flight. Cabin was clean and fresh (brand new A220) with reasonable comfort. On the way back it was HOP (regional subsidiary of AF) with older E190.

107,M Garela,Czech Republic,2023-01-08,2,"Our baggage did not make the destination airport. Air France told me initially that I will get them the day after (today) - which I have been told is no longer the case, right now I already expect them tomorrow. I live in the Czech Republic and I have spent 1 month in Spain. I had to take casual and business clothes with me, as well as gym clothes. As a consequence, I do not have clothes to work tomorrow, neither for my gym session. Additionally, I have my winter jacket in the missing baggage. Being in Prague and being in winter, I can not go anywhere without it. For this reason, I am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so I can make it through the day tomorrow. Air France does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say I have a permanent, and not a temporary address. I do not care what the policy say, this is going to cost me money and make me waste time. Being such a well known company, I trusted Air France. The whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport, where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come. Then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk.

108,K Morton,Spain,2022-12-16,3,"I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden.

136,S Simpson,United Kingdom,2022-09-07,2,"Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available!

However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag.

139,Randy Nunez,United States,2022-08-26,10,"I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day.

143,J Meeres,United States,2022-08-13,1,They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage.

145,L Karson,United States,2022-08-09,6,"We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back.

149,Y Burns,Canada,2022-08-02,1,"Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed.

151,A Marler,Germany,2022-08-01,1,"During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed.

AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was.

155,M Shaw,United States,2022-07-24,1,"We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you.

159,Michael Little,Australia,2022-07-18,7,"Online check-in and bag drop at Heathrow were straightforward, but the boarding procedure was cumbersome due to an apparent shortage of people at the gate (only 1 for most of the time). A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks).

The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter).

176,C Barker,United States,2022-06-26,1,"My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety.

I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !!

186,Andrew Zweng,United States,2022-06-14,2,"Delayed on initial flight for both our departure and return trips. This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent.

Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong.

195,E Victor,Netherlands,2022-05-22,1,"Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle).

First, my return flight from Paris to Noumea was changed so many times, I lost track, but it was at least 5 times. At least two times, they cancelled one leg only, but did not provide further information as to alternative flights. Other times, they provided an inconvenient alternative, and then it was almost impossible to reach a real person to select a viable alternative (3-4 days ""chatting"" through facebook - like a bad combination of email and chatting). After our last change, we got a new e-ticket and itinerary, only they never updated the real times. And we never got a message telling us that the flight had changed. As you usually do, we trusted the itinerary that they had sent, but we got to the airport just in time to get in. Lucky we had decided to get to the airport 4 hours before the flight, rather than 3. After running all over the airport, and no support whatsoever to get through the security checks, we made it just in time to board the plane - only to be seated and wait for an extra hour before the plane actually took off - because they decided to check the covid requirements during boarding!

200,Elie Esperanza,United States,2023-11-15,1,"Terrible experience. I have travelled extensively and with many airlines and KLM is by far the worst. My trip back to LA started with a cancelled flight for which none of the passengers were even offered any accommodation or even a food voucher. It has been 3 months since my trip and after extensive calls/emails they still declined to compensate me for the accommodation, food, and transport expenses due to the cancelled flight. I would have been fine with that as things do happen and I like to think of myself as an understanding person, however, upon arriving to LAX, I found out they lost my luggage. Whatever, I thought, it happens, it will arrive and I'll just pick it up. Thankfully I also had an AirTag inside so I saw where it was at all times. Well it was in Amsterdam for 3 months. I have probably called them more than 30 times to check on the status and racked up a bill of over $100 for this, they were extremely unhelpful and spilling empty words to reassure me. Finally, after 3 months, I decided to fly out to Amsterdam (paying out of my own pocket) and pick up the luggage myself since they obviously were not doing anything about my case even though I knew it's exact location.

202,George Howard,France,2023-11-12,2,"My experience was a nightmare. After having a poor experience, some years ago, I decided to give KLM another chance. My first flight was in July from Paris to Manila via Amsterdam. It was “OK,” but nothing to write home about. In August I was traveling to Athens with my family when a flight was changed and I was shuffled to KLM in order to be able to connect with an ongoing flight to a Greek island from Athens. On boarding in Paris, we were told that my granddaughter’s infant seat could be used on the plane. However, when we got to the plane, the infant seat was basically seized and we were told that it had been gate checked. It was not. It did not arrive in Athens for three weeks. Moreover, the other five suitcases that we had checked did not arrive either. It was exasperating, because we had rented a large space and were expecting seven other people to join us the following day on the island. Although I realize that “it is what it is,” the baggage experience with KLM was crushing, really depressing. Although we were late for our connection to the Greek island because of the lost baggage, which required filing immediate claims, KLM refused to cover any expenses of our overnight stay at a hotel. After we arrived on the island of the following day, which required buying five new tickets, the telephone numbers and email address provided by KLM to check our baggage never answered one single inquiry, and there were many – more than 10. We finally found the baggage ourselves, because my son was traveling with an Apple AirTag. However, we could not inform KLM of that because no one was answering either phone or email. We finally received five of the suitcases on the fourth day of our trip, and the infant seat on the last day of the trip, weeks later. If there had been even the slightest caring message, or concerned response from KLM, I would not be writing this review, but throughout, the KLM response was shameful.

I have previously had good experiences with KLM and it's usually my airline of choice to travel to Mexico from Europe. However this last trip was simply a nightmare. After only being informed of delay 1.5 hrs before departure (even though all flights had already had delays that day), I of course would miss my connecting flight to Mexico so I called the customer service line to help me find a solution, they first simply told me that there were no more flights to Mexico so there was nothing they could do. After spending 54min on hold they finally offered to re route me through a BA flight leaving later that night. The purpose of my travel was already ruined and I would be missing the event I was traveling for but I accepted this as the only option of still making my trip. 3 hours before the BA flight was set to depart the flight was cancelled without reason provided. When speaking again to the re-booking agent he said he understood he would cancel my booking at this stage and just claim a refund for me, I continuously asked on the phone if I would get a full refund since the flight delays and cancellations were not on my behalf and I had not taken any of my flights, which he assured me should be the case and I should expect a refund for all of the flights. A few days later I received a refund only for tax and government fees (about 10% of total ticket cost) claiming that I had voluntarily cancelled my flight which is so wrong!

216,Ashley Johnson,United Kingdom,2023-10-03,2,"Nothing changes with KLM, except for the worse. The locker above me and across from was full of crew stuff. They are now calling it a daytime flight and ""due to passenger demand"" serve the 2nd meal in the middle of the flight, ie not long after finishing the first meal, maybe 3 hours. Who wants to eat another full meal 3 hours after having a big meal when all they have done is just sit on a plane? I didn't bother. That left 5 hours of the flight still to go. They said there would be food before landing but that turned out to be a chicken roll. Then 3/4 of the way through watching a movie the screen froze and then the message “IFE Not Working”. When it came back on, that film had disappeared and my list of favourites gone. I went to the toilet right next to me to see, ""Out of order"".

A change of aircraft type on the way out meant that most of the passengers in the business cabin were playing musical chairs to sit with their companions. I moved seat three times to accommodate others. The return journey was the same. The two x two x two seating layout is antiquated and we had originally chosen a different aircraft with 1x2x2 seating, meaning we would all have had an aisle seat. The first and last, short haul, flights were in the standard, awful, European business class configuration. In other words an economy seat with 3x3 and the middle seat left empty. That said the cabin crew on all four legs were great. Food was as good as most and better than some. We all got our first choice and there were no issues with dishes running out. One of the great draws in long haul business class with KLM is the Delft cottages filled with Dutch gin which are offered at the end of the flight. These are all numbered and collector's items.

220,Théo Denys,Belgium,2023-09-16,8,"I took a Flight with KLM from Amsterdam to Shanghai. Here’s how it went. Price: 800€ Return Class: Economy ## 1) Boarding I started my journey from Brussels. After a couple of minutes looking for the KLM desk at the Brussels Train Station, I finally found it. Although the online check-in didn't work, the physical check-in was seamless as it only took 5 minutes. I then took the Thalys train to Amsterdam. My train arrived late so I had only 1h45 before take-off. For some reason I had Priority, so it sped the process a bit. After security check (with automatic passport check w/ facial recognition!), I went to the boarding deck. I still had to wait 20 minutes. Then I could finally board. ## 2) Plane experience For this let's just do a positive-neutral-negative points list **The good** - Free *Wi-Fi* allows messaging with limited image sharing. *Large screen* with movies, a dozen games, music, video destination guides and even a Google Earth tool ! *Food* was great. Quality-wise is what you would except whit pre-cooked meals. (I had raviolis, with a slice of bread, actual cheese, olives and Piment stuffed with some kind of cheese.) Quantity-wise I found it satisfying. I had one meal at around 6:30 pm EU time (GMT+1) and one at around 2:00 pm or 8:00 pm on the local schedule. *Toilets*: clean, spacy, often available. **Meh** - *Leg-room* was sufficient but getting in and out was really an hassle. (I'm 1m89). Being in the middle, I always had trouble to get to my seat. *Sleep quality*: First, I wished we could move the table up and down. The only way I can sleep is putting my head on a table. But since there's no place to stretch, I have to put it around my chest level. I had to pile things up. Secondly, I wished the screen could be locked. So you don't power it on when you rest on it. **The bad** - *Provided earbuds quality:* I didn't expected them to be that bad. I'm not asking more than those school/ office headsets or quality of a 100$ smartphone. But with those while music was logically not possible (that's ok) but even listening to movies was painful: either bump up sound to uncomfortable level or miss parts of dialogues. Sparse subtitles availability didn't helped. Since airline loves charging extras, why not one for ""quality"" earbuds? Poor *decline* ability. Couldn't fall asleep on those. Not much informational *media* offerings. While a handful of podcasts were offered, there very few episodes of those. Additionally, there is no (virtual) newspaper platform. ## Conclusion : I honestly think for the price it's not that. But it's my first intercontinental and my third flight overall, so my judgement doesn't worth much.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Shanghai via Amsterdam,September 2023,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,True,Brussels,Shanghai,Amsterdam,Positive,0.9705,  take amsterdam shanghai go price return class economy 1 boarding start journey brussels couple minute look desk brussels train station finally find although online work physical seamless take 5 minute take thalys train amsterdam train arrive late 1h45 reason priority speed process bit security check automatic passport check facial recognition go board deck still wait 20 minute finally board 2 experience let point list good free allows message limited image share large screen movie dozen game music video destination guide google earth tool food great except whit meal raviolis slice bread actual cheese olive piment stuff kind cheese find satisfy one meal around pm eu time one around pm pm local schedule toilet clean spacy often available meh sufficient get really hassle 1m89 middle always trouble get seat sleep quality first wish move table way sleep put head table since place stretch put around chest level pile thing secondly wish screen lock power rest bad provide earbuds quality expect bad ask office headset quality 100 smartphone music logically possible ok listen movie painful either bump sound uncomfortable level miss part dialogue sparse subtitle availability help since love charge extras one quality earbuds poor decline ability fall asleep much informational medium offering handful podcasts offer episode additionally virtual newspaper platform conclusion honestly think price first intercontinental third overall judgement worth much

223,Arthur Anthony Williams,United Kingdom,2023-09-03,1,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with my recent experience with KLM Airlines, specifically concerning flight KL1527 on August 28, 2023. This ordeal has left me deeply unsatisfied and dissuaded from ever considering KLM as a viable airline option in the future. On the mentioned date, I received a text notification informing me of flight cancellations, which led me to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Upon arrival, I was met with the bewildering situation where the KLM customer service desk was closed, leaving passengers in the lurch. Instead of providing proper assistance, KLM staff merely offered basic advice and handed out disruption information letters. According to the initial information provided by KLM staff, my flight was cancelled due to UK traffic control problems. I was instructed to book accommodation on my own and assured that my flight would be rebooked within an hour. Following their advice, I made the necessary arrangements for a room and returned to the city centre via train. However, to my dismay, I did not receive any rebooking notification within the promised timeframe. After waiting in vain, I decided to contact KLM customer care, only to be put on hold for an excruciating 40 minutes. When someone finally answered, they abruptly cut off the call, displaying a complete disregard for the passengers' concerns. I had no choice but to call back, and to my utter disbelief, I was informed that my flight was, in fact, operational, contradicting the previous information given by KLM staff. This inconsistency resulted in a mad scramble to return to the airport and barely make it in time for my flight. Furthermore, despite numerous attempts, I have not received any response from KLM's customer complaints department. To make matters worse, when I revisited the KLM customer service desk at the airport, I encountered an extremely unprofessional and rude agent. He displayed a dismissive attitude and attempted to evade responsibility by suggesting that my flight must have been cancelled at the time, which contradicted the information initially provided by KLM staff. His behaviour was unacceptable. This entire experience has demonstrated an astonishing lack of communication and organizational competence on KLM's part. It is disheartening that an airline with such a long history of operation would fail so miserably in providing essential customer care and accurate information during a crisis. In comparison to budget airlines like Ryanair and easyJet, KLM's performance during this situation was abysmal. In conclusion, I am deeply dissatisfied with KLM Airlines and will never consider flying with them again. The ordeal I endured, along with the lack of proper communication and professionalism, has left a lasting negative impression. I strongly urge KLM to improve its customer care, organizational efficiency, and communication procedures to avoid alienating more passengers in the future.",E190,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Norwich,August 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,False,Amsterdam,Norwich,,Negative,-0.994,  write express deep disappointment frustration recent experience airline specifically concern kl1527 august 28 2023 ordeal leave deeply unsatisfied dissuade ever consider viable option future mention date receive text notification inform cancellation lead amsterdam airport schiphol upon arrival meet bewilder situation customer service desk close leave passenger lurch instead provide proper assistance staff merely offer basic advice hand disruption information letter accord initial information provide staff cancel due uk traffic control problem instruct book accommodation assure rebooked within hour follow advice make necessary arrangement room return city centre via train however dismay receive rebooking notification within promise timeframe wait vain decide contact customer care put hold excruciate 40 minute someone finally answer abruptly cut call display complete disregard passenger concern choice call back utter disbelief inform fact operational contradict previous information give staff inconsistency result mad scramble return airport barely make time furthermore despite numerous attempt receive response customer complaint department make matter worse revisit customer service desk airport encounter extremely unprofessional rude agent display dismissive attitude attempt evade responsibility suggest must cancel time contradict information initially provide staff behaviour unacceptable entire experience demonstrate astonishing lack communication organizational competence part dishearten long history operation fail miserably provide essential customer care accurate information crisis comparison budget airline like ryanair easyjet performance situation abysmal conclusion deeply dissatisfied airline never consider fly ordeal endure along lack proper communication professionalism leave lasting negative impression strongly urge improve customer care organizational efficiency communication procedure avoid alienate passenger future

The person at the immigration office was nice, he informed me that I could go to the other KLM counter and they would help me with my boarding pass. I was greeted with the same unprofessional, rude, unhelpful and unknowledgeable KLM counter staff lady with major attitude, I was told I would have to take a number and wait. What would’ve happened if I had an earlier flight with less time to wait?! And that’s what I asked her - she ignored the question and looked the other way. I asked another counter staff if there was a way if she could check about my baggage being put on the plane while I waited to speak to someone about my boarding pass. She said I have to wait my turn. I did not ask her for any special treatment, I just asked her if she could check my baggage tag on the computer since she wasn’t doing anything.

The flight was delayed by around one hour, it was the infamous day of July 5-6 where Schiphol had a severe storm that caused the delay and cancellation of hundreds of flights. Ours was luckily delayed only by one hour because the flight before departed later from Amsterdam. Boarding was not done using zones. People started gathering around the gate standing around 20 minutes before boarding even started. I The flight itself was pretty chill, the crew was very professional and comforting. The breakfast that was given was fruit salad, yogurt and a hot drink. It was okay for an early morning flight. Landing at Schiphol was smooth. My only complaint would be the width of Economy class seats. I am no small person, but also not super large. And yet I found that the seats were really narrow even for thinner people than me. It felt as my hands could only go on the table or that I would need to cross them, in order not to touch the other person. Also seats were lacking padding, they were pretty thin.

They only offer a cheese sandwich on European flights which excludes anyone with wheat or gluten or dairy intolerances. There's no alternative. Though I got their gluten free meal on this long haul and it was inedible. And of course no mid flight snacks provided unlike for everyone else. Tip, bring your own snacks with you. Long haul entertainment is extremely limited. Bring your own device and streaming service. They have little on offer and any tv series are never from the beginning. What's the point in starting a new show you've not seen before on Season 4, Episode 8? Flights are nearly always delayed (again I fly with them almost every weekend). Almost without fail. I expect a delayed message from them every Friday before I set out for Schiphol. Their lounge in Schengen zone of Schiphol is truly dreadful - too busy, hardly any food or drinks on offer. However, they're second lounge for non Schengen is very good and praise where praise is due. I just wish they'd stop discrimination against people with food allergies.

250,B Ranic,Croatia,2023-07-06,1,"I bought 3 tickets for my family on June 12, 2022 for trip Zagreb-Amsterdam-Bergen-Amsterdam-Zagreb planed for March 2023. So, it was 9 months in advance. But 5 months after purchasing tickets I received an e-mail from KLM with totally new flights schedule that devasted my original plan, hotel reservations, date of return etc. But, ok, it was still in advance and I rearranged all the things including the newly appeared overnight stay in Amsterdam on way back to Zagreb. On the very beginning of our trip at flight from Zagreb to Bergen one of our bags was lost so we spend the first day in Bergen without our warm clothing. But real horror is coming at our way back from Bergen to Zagreb via Amsterdam. On March 17, 2023. we were supposed to arrive from Tromso to Bergen by Wideroe flight at 12:40, and then continue to Amsterdam by KLM flight at 14:20. We were (online) check-in for flight from Bergen to Amsterdam. Flight from Tromso was slightly delayed (for 30 minutes) but still more than an hour before departure of KLM flight. While waiting for baggage I immediately try to contact KLM agent at Bergen airport to ask for advice how to continue our trip but there was literally nobody from KLM to help us, only automatic check-in machines and ""people-less"" baggage drop-in counters. It was 60 minutes before departure of KLM flight from Bergen to Amsterdam. After baggage was delivered we try to check in for Bergen but automatic check-in machine rejected our tickets, although I made on-line check in 30 hours in advance. I was continuously trying to contact KLM service desk at +47 22 64 37 52 and by WhatsApp to get help or advice, but was waiting in the queue and connected to agent only at 14:19. Suggestion was to contact KLM agent at Bergen airport, but there was no / any KLM agent at Bergen airport at that time. So, I was forced to purchase new tickets by the Internet from KLM site for really extremely high price. Alternative was to stay and wait (for what?) at Bergen airport… After returning from the trip, calvary with KLM Customer Care Service, is continuing… After tens of repeated messages and inquiries and 2 months, I manage to get refund for overnight stay in Amsterdam and small 'compensation' for lost baggage, but no chance to resolve issue with ""no help, no service, no agent"" at Bergen airport and forcing me to buy new, extra expensive tickets for the flight that we already had tickets and were check-in. ""Customer care agents"" replied to my web form inquiries and claims (replied only from time to time) that they are not authorized to ""interfere with decisions of other department""  and just give general ""psychological"" help, express ""general understanding and regret"", but not solving the issue. The KLM approach to customer care is to hide behind user unfriendly web forms and in fact, just like at the airport in Bergen, there is no possibility of real and direct communication with someone who is authorized and able to solve real problems.

KLM staff are generally pretty friendly and this flight was no exception. One massive plus point I've noticed with KLM over the years is they match your formality level. I'm quite relaxed and the crew match that by calling me by my first name etc. Food was adequate for such a long flight. There was a main meal not long after take off followed by a mid-flight snack and a sandwich just before landing. The beverage trolley was wheeled out a few times. Usual tiny airline food portions however but was quite tasty-aside from a horrible coconut type dessert thing. KLM give bottled water instead of those weird plastic pots with the foil lid that guarantee you will drench the passenger sat on your lap in Economy. This is good. IFE with KLM is always slightly disappointing. Yes, there's a lot to choose from but the vast majority is American rubbish! Why the fixation with US content?? You're a Dutch airline.

262,Z Smart,United States,2023-06-23,1,"Do not fly KLM Cityhoppers, between London City Airport and Amsterdam! Both of my flights were either cancelled and delayed! What followed next showed an airline that was not only trying to nickel and dime its passengers at every opportunity, but also had no clue what the rest of the industry was doing! On the day of my departure, I received an email informing me that my flight was cancelled and that I would be rebooked on a different flight soon. When I saw the message displayed an option to change flight or request refund, I followed the link. Then I realized KLM would charge me extra to change my flight. How ridiculous! You cancelled my flight and asked me to pay more to make a change! When I called the service center, I was told that the flight was not canceled and everything was on schedule. So I went a ahead and checked in online. But when I arrived at the airport (LCY) the next day, the billboard showed my flight was indeed cancelled! And I had been rebooked to al later flight. On the day of my return, my flight was delayed. So I wanted to catch an earlier flight at the airport. And I had to do this at a service center where there was a long line. My Sky priority status made no difference, although KLM displayed two queues--Sky priority and General Boarding. I took my number and waited, and waited. 30 minutes later the line hardly moved. So I decided to give it a try at the gate. When I reached a KLM gate, I was told I would have to pay a fee to change to another flight. How ridiculous! You delayed my flight and forced me to stick to the same flight, unless I am offering some extra money. And the gate agent could not change my reservation and I would have to go to a transfer center somewhere far in the terminal. And there was not other flight available. In sum, I don't remember I ever ran into problems on both flights of a round trip and also was told to pay a fee to change a flight even if it was not my fault.

264,K Smit,Netherlands,2023-06-19,1,"Before my trip to Vietnam, I booked with KLM, first put on standby for the flight to Paris, then also put on standby for Ho Chi Minh, then to Hanoi I was not on the passenger list. The flight I was supposed to have was now full. A ticket is no guarantee to actually fly! What makes it worse; it's business as usual, so as a passenger you just have to deal with it. Employees were disinterested and even completely unwilling to help at Schiphol. Was stunned that KLM's service level had dropped to this level. Finally got in touch with customer service; apologies and the message that I did arrive at destination so that's why they don't apply compensation. They also indicated that it was normal that a flight was overbooked and that you could be placed on standby. Wanted to speak to a manager, but they said they would close the case and stop responding to my emails. Horrible start to the holiday and cringeworthy service.

Was verbluft dat het serviceniveau van KLM naar dit niveau was gedaald.

265,Robert Warren,United States,2023-06-18,3,"We were flying from Washington, D.C. to Cardiff in the UK.  The trouble began when we were about to board a connecting flight at JFK in New York City: the flight from Amsterdam to Cardiff was cancelled literally 30 minutes before we boarded the flight out to Amsterdam. We were held at the gate while they rebooked everything, and we nearly missed our flight. The flight to Amsterdam was rough: we wanted to sleep, but there were very loud passengers behind us, and they wouldn't be quiet for a minute. Once in Amsterdam, we were routed to Edinburgh in Scotland, then flown to Cardiff on Loganair. We were told we might have additional baggage fees, but we lucked out and this didn't happen. We got to Cardiff about five hours late, and we were exhausted by then. We had to fly back on KLM, and the fun started again. The plane was held up on the tarmac in Cardiff after they realized the plane was leaking deicer fluid from the wings, and we sat there in a hot plane for about 90 minutes while a technician tried to fix it. At one point, they announced the plane would not be able to fly. However, they were able to fix it somehow, so we weren't forced to get rebooked for another flight and spend hours waiting around Cardiff. The flight from Amsterdam to Dulles in D.C. was relatively harmless, although I found the flight attendant we had rather rude. She lectured me at one point because I had put some trash in a plastic water bottle. Finally, we made it back to D.C. and through passport control. And we started waiting for our luggage on the carousel, and we waited and waited for one large bag, because, as it turned out, it had been left behind in Amsterdam. So, we had to file a claim and wait two more days until our bag finally showed up. My wife was taking another trip and only had a day to do laundry afterward. I wasn't impressed overall.

No food vouchers offered, you have to force them to do everything and therefore force you to become an annoying passenger for the unfortunate ground personell. Last but not least, our last flight was delayed by two hours and the only offered option instead of our actual transfer flight was to stay at the airport for 10 hours, again no offers of food or lounge without going to the counter and waiting in line for an hour. What took the crown was that our automatically rebooked flights and human rebooked flights were all still in the system with no tickets reissued. That meant that we were unable to check in, unable to reserve seats, unable to get the seats we payed for and altogether made it impossible for the lady at the counter to understand what was going on without calling KLM directly.

276,Silvia Mezzasoma,Netherlands,2023-05-04,1,"KLM was my preferred airline before covid, now it is consistently my worst travel experience airline! After having completed so many surveys for KLM where they wanted to know how valued and special I felt as a customer, now they seem not to care any longer at all about their customers. I used to be a flying blue gold member, almost reached platinum and now I am still a silver member. Despite this, the way KLM now treats me every time I fly with them is worse than the cheapest of the airlines. Their staff do not appear to know or understand the applicable benefits for each of their membership levels. It clearly states on the website that silver flying blue members have priority check-in, baggage drop-off and boarding. However, every single time I go to any of those lanes I am told extremely rudely that I am not allowed to use either of these services. Even when I show them the current KLM flying blue website / the KLM App that clearly states that silver members have those benefits, I am told that it no longer applies. In February 2023 KLM left us stranded in Tanzania for 24 hours due to allegedly security threats. However, when going to the official Dutch foreign ministry advice for travelling no alerts were provided for the area we were in. After I finally returned home, I filed a claim to KLM for compensation which was denied with no explanations. Then I filed a claim for reimbursement of expenses (namely 1 extra day at the hotel and 1 extra day at Schiphol long term parking) and I only received a refund for the hotel. I asked at least 25 times to KLM via all the channels they have (email, website, KLM customer service support at Schiphol airport, Messenger, flying blue phone number) why I didn’t receive a refund for the parking expenses.

277,Anders Pedersen,Rwanda,2023-05-04,8,"Flew CPH-AMS-KGL with KLM 3rd May 2023 on B737-800 and A330-200 aircrafts, respectively. Ticket bought from Ticket.com and easily handled online on KLMs homepage. Check-in online with success, but it does not reduce check-in time in Airport, so it just wastes time. Luggage checked in the whole way and delivered perfectly in Kigali. Seat choice functions well and is free to Flying Blue (elite) card holders. As both flights became almost full, I had to change my seats accordingly; eventually I got a (5 cm only) more spacious “Economy Comfort” seat which almost reassembles “Premium Economy”, which is a class higher. On the short haul I picked a declinable exit seat and had the whole row to myself. Lounges in Copenhagen (Aviator, 2 choices) and in Amsterdam (4 choices) are both nice and provide excellent breakfast. They open as early as 5 am, which made use possible. In the KLM Lounge 52 in Amsterdam, there is a new hype with their extremely popular Mimosa drink (champagne with 25% orange juice, blended, not stirred). Full catering service onboard on both flights, even the short haul to Amsterdam. FAs were good and energetic, particularly on the short haul. On the long haul, however, some cabin crew tend to patronise the passengers. Onboard supplies are quite sparse, unless one pushes. Call buttons are only answered after long time waits. Long haul rendered 2 hot meal services, but the food is not good, apart from the starters (Mediterranean Mezze). I tried both main dishes offered at lunch and they were both disappointing. They offer hot and soft drinks but also Heineken and (cheap) wines onboard; however, the red wine is somehow good (Shiraz from South Africa).

279,S Harris,United States,2023-04-28,2,"I had a horrible experience flying KLM from Houston to Amsterdam and back again. When I arrived to the check in gate in Houston I was told that I had been downgraded from Premium Comfort to Economy because of a change in aircraft and that my baggage allowance had changed. I had packed my bags the night before and then woken up early to drive 3 hours to Houston to catch the flight. Needless to say, I wasn't willing to throw any of my luggage in the trash. I told them there wasn't any way that I would have had time to re-pack my bags (now noticing that I had received an email at 3 am notifying me of the downgrade.) After much discussion I was finally permitted to take all my luggage with me. The rudeness and lack of understanding at the counter was disgusting. On the plane the staff were perfectly friendly. However, somehow in the downgrade process my meal plan had been erased. I have a severe allergy but thankfully the attendant was very kind and helpful in finding me something I could eat. On the return flight I had the opposite problem - my meal plan had resurfaced but the food I'm allergic to was very present in the dish. I notified the staff that I had an allergy and was there anything else I could possibly eat? I'm not picky, I just don't particularly want to break out in hives. She very begrudgingly searched around until she found something but she wasn't happy, saying that I had requested a specific meal. I acknowledged her, and said yes I had, but the ingredients aren't listed when I select it and - I have an allergy. For the next meal she brought me the dish again, with the food I'm allergic to, and smiled when she handed it to me. Oh joy. The smile on her face made me stare at the food in disbelief in front of me. I accepted it and just didn't eat. How could she smile like that? I had submitted a request for the refund fare difference for the first flight and it was accepted but I was told that I needed to resubmit it again after all flights are finished. I guess because they can't keep track of it for a week? The service I received was atrocious. The red tape ridiculous. But they certainly know how to train their employees on board to be friendly, serving you your food allergy and all. I guess they do not know how to problem solve, think on their feet or be courteous.

280,S Mayle,United States,2023-04-23,2,"The food in the SkyLounge at Schipol Airport was excellent. My wife was sick during the flight and the initial care was truly ugly. But, eventually, the purser came to my wife and offered genuine help, care and support. She was wonderful. I wish I knew her name because she was so special.  My traveling companion uses a wheelchair. KLM said they would assist us from the Lounge to the airplane and, when we arrived at IAD, from the airplane through customs to the baggage area. Sadly, the assistance did not come. I had to somehow make my way with carry-on luggage while pushing the wheelchair. I am over 80 years old and getting wheelchair assistance was exactly why we purchased business-class tickets. When we got to the gate at Schipol, the attendants did assist us getting onto the plane. On arrival at IAD, however, we - and the other wheelchair passengers, were told to wait in the aircraft until our wheelchairs came to the door of the plane. This took close to an hour! There were not enough assistants to push all the wheelchairs. So, we were all left sitting at the gate for the plane with the passengers who were getting ready to board the plane staring at us. Finally, as a group, we told the few attendants who were assigned to us that we should proceed.  We asked the assistants to help the weakest and those of us who were stronger, slowly proceeded to customs. When we got to customs, there was a separate line for wheelchairs. This line was shorter and moved more quickly than the line for able-bodied passengers. Unfortunately, our wheelchair assistants left us saying they had to go to assist other handicapped people. We all helped each other to the customs inspectors. I realize KLM is not responsible for the wheelchair assistance at IAD but they did leave us standing unattended having deposited us off the plane in plain view of the next group of passengers who were waiting to board the plane for the flight back to Amsterdam. The crew members said they were off to their hotel. The food was so disappointing. For the main meal (in business), we got stuffed shells as an appetizer.

282,E Russell,United States,2023-04-19,1,"I booked my wife's birthday trip well in advance. I transferred points so we could elevate our flying experience. We also booked her best friend with us separately. I booked all 3 in premium economy together from SFO to AMS. Upon check-in (24 hours prior), the system split all 3 of us up. I had to call customer service to fix the issue. However, they were unable to sit our friend with us. We were excited about our journey so decided to just go with it. On our return flight, we were yet again split up and also downgraded. I had to spend another 3 hours on the phone trying to find solutions. No customer service reps wanted to help. I had to find the solution myself and we were still unable to get our friend with us. I was told to do the reimbursement online for the downgrade. So I did and it was rejected. More phone calls to customer service. I asked for supervisors but was told the reps do not have supervisors. No managers to assist them. I was told it was rejected because I didn't submit proof. Is information not stored at KLM? I asked for the reps email so I can send proof. Apparently reps do not have company emails so I cant email the rep now. I submitted proof and was told I would get some points back. I was given 68k points for my troubles. 68k?! Can I even book a premium economy flight for 2 for that? During this process I have spent approximately 8 hours on the phone and been ""disconnected"" four times without a return call. It seems KLM just ignores the customer in hopes they go away. They put all the work on the customer rather than take charge. This has been the worst customer service I have ever seen. I hope KlM provides further training for their employees.

283,Anders Pedersen,Rwanda,2023-04-19,6,"Flew KGL-AMS-CPH with KLM 16 April 2023 on A330-200 and B737 aircrafts. Economy Lite ticket was quite cheap, bought from an OTA and easily handled online on KLMs homepage. Perks as Flying Blue gold card holder was given throughout from priority, lounge, selecting preferred seat, etc. Check-in online did not work – wasted time on several attempts. However, the check-in KGL was quick and hassle-free. Got option to select a better seat as the flight was full; I chose an exit seat, 30B, which was a real winner and one of very few seats with gorgeous leg space. Such a seat costs 300 EUR if prebooked, but was offered to me during check-in free of charge, likely due to my gold card. This seat, given to me in the last moment, saved my trip as the original seating had changed; the flight had become completely full and I about to be given a seat in a very crowded section near toilets. Access to KLMs 3rd party Pearl lounge was granted due to my Flying Blue gold card. The lounge is well supplied, but of sparse offerings. Departure from Kigali became 4 hours delayed; however, all delays were properly informed on monitors, by email, and by SMS. That caused me missing my flight in Amsterdam, but I did not stress: just went to the KLM lounge and printed out the revised BPs for the last leg to CPH, which was scheduled ambiently. Enjoyed a solid, nice breakfast in the impressive KLM “52 Lounge” in non-Schengen sector. Passport control and security check took more than an hour; not acceptable. The serious delay, arose from a wheel puncture while the aircraft stopped over in Zanzibar. It was explained in detail by flight crew and from cockpit. A new flight crew had just boarded in Kigali; they were fresh, well groomed, and well rested. Service was fine, but food provided was very little, though included a small, hot airy pizza (no alternative). The wines offered were of RSA Cape origin: The red wine (Shiraz) was good, while the Chenin Blanc white wine was undrinkable. They were served in well labelled mini-bottles which are a nice touch. The cabin crew differed tremendously in attitude, ranging from the typical, surly, patronising classic Dutch crew, to more modern and empathic types. Initially, I was not recognised as status flyer, but later they found out and provided me a full amenity kit and a Dutch ceramic mini-house as souvenir. Disembarkation in Schiphol was tedious by using busses from a remote stand. Last flight to CPH was briefly on time, and service onboard was fine. Luggage handled correctly throughout and arrived in CPH timely, despite having been rebooked and re-labelled. The experience with KLM was good.

I ended up paying my phone carrier to make the calls to KLM.

Did it get sent to Mars with Elon Musk's rocket? Since I was travelling again (this time, not KLM), I took the time to walk over the Baggage Desk at Arrivals in Schiphol. What I learned is that not only did they never actually check whether it's still at the departure place, or at a stop-over place, no, they suggested I start calling airports in Zanzibar and Dar (where we landed on the way, but I did not have to leave the plane....unlike my luggage, probably)! Once again: a Business Class passenger, member of both private and corporate loyalty programs, gets their luggage lost by KLM and is advised to go look for it themselves. Fly KLM again?

When I checked in online on September 10th for KL678 from Calgary to Amsterdam, I was offered and I accepted and paid for an upgrade from Comfort to Business Class, at a cost of $1134.28 Cdn. When I checked in at the KLM counter the next day I was told I was bumped from BC to accommodate a crew member who was returning  to Amsterdam. Even though I was civil and courteous I was moved to row 43, at the back of the airplane, because my Economy Comfort seat was not available. When I asked for a refund at the counter, the agent said I had to do that online and it would not be a problem. She wrote down the KLM refund website link. After I returned from my 3 week trip, I submitted to KLM the refund request. One month later I received a one sentence email declining my request, without reasons.

Upon arriving in Mexico City it was apparent my luggage never made it. I have no reason to believe Mexico City airport lost it as everyone else's luggage was there, although Mexico City airport was exceptionally unhelpful, but that's another story. Afterwards I contacted KLM customer service, and despite all evidence supporting they lost it as it never made it to Mexico, they said I had to file the lost luggae claim through aeromexico as they were the last flight of the booking and there's nothing they can do. Aeromexico said they won't and to contact KLM. Now to be clear aeromexico was even more unhelpful as they sent me from customer service rep to customer service rep, finally saying I have to email, which I have yet to get a response from. However, as bad as they are, they didn't lose my luggge. KLM clearly did, and so I have 2 airlines telling me to contact the other one, when it's very obvious which one lost one, but in the end KLM's response is ""due to regulations"" they can't trace my luggage that they lost and I'm essentially out of luck. Essentially ""Yea we lost your luggage but we can't technically help you."" Regulations or not, I can't say that's satisfactory customer service.

Booking flight tickets is an easy and straight forward matter, the same can not be told when it comes to selecting seating for the flights. I am a frequent traveler and a father of four wonderful children. I have been travelling with infant numerous times between Europe and South America (KLM, Brasil) and between Europe and Asia (Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways, Lufthansa), and it has never been a problem getting an infant bassinet - until now. When purchasing the tickets, I always follow up by talking with a real human to ensure my request for an infant bassinet is registered in the booking. I then repeat the request upon check-in as soon as it opens (typically a day before departure, depending on destination). KLM has not delivered on our 3 last intercontinental flights, leaving us with an infant on our laps for 14 hour flights. All the while, we can see the seats where infant bassinets can be utilized are occupied with passengers not travelling with infants. Children grow quickly, and I doubt we will have more children. As such, this is a temporary problem for us.

Unfortunately, it has now been over a month and a half and I have not received my promised compensation. There has also been no further information provided or response to my inquiries.

Equally with the baggage handling companies, whose personnel is not well paid unfortunately anyway. Now with air traffic resuming to pre-pandemic levels, that same personnel is impossible to come by. Of course they have found more reliable employers as there is a general labour shortage anyway. As a result and to be fair, KLM is caught in the middle. KLM has had to drastically cut back on flights and occupancy, in a time where it was hoping to make up lost revenue during the pandemic. Customer service is therefore swamped in claims, while staff there too is undoubtedly in short supply. This is sad to see because the on board service is excellent and the seats in business class are good and can recline fully.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Amsterdam to San Francisco,September 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,True,Amsterdam,San Francisco,,Positive,0.91,  business class long haul treat great chef food serve wonderful attentive staff perhaps background bad review order many bad review customer care schiphol airport handle pandemic schiphol infinite wisdom think wise lay much security personnel dutch government provide subsidy company fire employee equally baggage handle company whose personnel well pay unfortunately anyway air traffic resuming level personnel impossible come course find reliable employer general labour shortage anyway result fair caught middle drastically cut back flight occupancy time hop make lose revenue pandemic customer service therefore swamp claim staff undoubtedly short supply sad see board service excellent seat business class good recline fully

349,S. Jackson,Canada,2022-10-26,4,"Coming back from Europe on KLM was not pleasant, after a lovely holiday. I've happily flown KLM Economy many times in the past, but there is a definite decline in the service offered now! The one thing I will say is that there was good leg room and I am 5'7"" tall, so that was a positive. they do not carry any pillows now for Economy passengers. You do get the see through blanket and a bottle of water. Meals: first meal of dinner was fairly tasty, a chicken curry. However, they offered bread rolls, and when I told the cabin crew that I had no butter on my tray, she said that they found out about a month before that butter had been deleted from meal trays .. they only knew because so many passengers were asking for it! Dessert was handed out later, a tasteless yellow cake in a plastic wrap. The cutlery is now made of flat balsa-like wood, stamped into shapes of knife, fork and spoon. Like eating with hospital tongue depressors. The second meal was unidentifiable .. a boiling hot piece of a pizza like sandwich with no discernable filling, and a sloppy salad, beige and liquid with nothing really to tell what it was.

350,A Garner,Canada,2022-10-24,1,"Booked these flights months in advance. From Edmonton to Athens with a layover in Amsterdam in order to catch our flight to Egypt to meet our tour group. KLM changed our flight times without even notifying us (this is not acceptable), we happened to look ourselves and realized that 3 weeks prior to our departure date we would not be able to make any of our connections (panic!) My travel partner spent hours on the phone with KLM sine I was working - she would be put on hold 15 minutes at a time by the agent who was nothing but rude and unhelpful and she was told vague different reasons for the flight changes from different employees. It seemed like they were trying to get rid of us or it was a hassle to assist us. KLM offered to place us on new flights that were not reasonable and eventually after hours agreed there were no reasonable flights and would refund us our tickets. We then had to rebook our flights which cost more as we were now only 3 weeks away from leaving and took us on a completely different flight path. This caused us to have to cancel hotels and re-book others. On top of this we were informed our refund of about $1400 would take 3-5 MONTHS! I understand these things happen, but I believe we should have had better communication and assistance. They also changed our flights coming home as well and I had to take another day off work, but I'm not even focusing on that. Based on what I have read in the air passenger protection regulations I do not think they abided by code.

351,D Karson,Netherlands,2022-10-24,2,"Poor impersonal service in economy class, far from what KLM wants its potential clients to believe with their marketing campaigns, delivering a excellent service and life long loyalty, we fly together, you feel at home with us etc., etc. I had the pleasure of spending 10 hours with KLM. The seat in economy comfort, ample leg room, but horrible comfort after 6 hrs. you do not know how to sit comfortable. Just after the start you get bottle of Spa water with a small package containing a small tissue to clean your hands, it is the only one you get during the flight. Thereafter you have to wait 1-1,5 hrs. to get your 'exquisite' dinner, a choice between vegetarian or chicken, this is served with a large basket which seems to be a salad, all served on a tray with non-slippery top side, which tends to move over your seat table as no anti-slip is installed under tray. so you have risk that your complete meal including beverage ends up in your lap, Regarding the taste of the food served, the chicken meal is neutral/ ok, but not very tasteful, the salad which seems to be a highflyer by KLM, is too awful to further describe, it tastes horrible, KLM should be ashamed to serve this to customers. the piece of bread which comes with dinner is though and hardly eatable, the piece of cheese sticks to its plastic packaging. The 'exquisite' dinner is served with one beverage, no further beverage service during or afterwards. After dinner you wait another 45 mins to get coffee and the famous cake, which KLM is proud to serve. This cake is very very sweet and again without any taste, except the sweet, overall it is just a tasteless piece of cake. After the coffee, you have to wait couple of hours for any further service is provided, This time a hump of bread served which seems to be cheese and some kind of sauce and a bottle of water, no other choice of beverage. The bread again is tasteless! Just short before landing the last service is done, again the famous tray with anti-slip topside, but no anti-slip underneath the tray, so large risk that the content of tray and your beverage will end up in your lap. This serving is a hump of dough with some cheese and sauce, which KLM calls a pizza snack, the dough, sorry pizza, is so tough it is difficult to swallow. Again some kind of salad is served, again tasteless and some kind of dessert, which turns out to be cream with some cookie crunches and caramel sauce. With all the food being served no salt and pepper is provided, also no hygiene tissues are provided. No announcement is being made that in case you require additional beverage and/or snack you can go to one of the galleys Summarizing the food and service on this KLM flight was horrible and it is a full disgrace what they are offering for food. KLM was once solid consistent quality performing airline, but now they are completely lost, no more focus on the customer who pays top dollar to fly KLM, instead they focus on social community aspects. Management or whoever is in charge of cabin / inflight service have totally forgotten about their customers and/or try to force them into sustainable, vegan, vegetarian options which might be high on the agenda of KLM, but not always high on the agenda of their paying customers. Although it is not easy to say, this KLM and its service is far from the KLM it once was.

No thanks to them because they wouldn't respond to anything - no emails, no calls, nothing. And now it's 2 days before October and I haven't seen any compensation whatsoever. A customer service rep contacted me finally in early September and ended up only approving $100 euros for my month of misery, even though my suitcase was totally destroyed by the time it got back .. but they say it is still functional. I wouldn't even give it away - it is trash. I have yet to see the 100 euros and she won't even answer my emails. I also did not get my baggage fee reimbursed and the rep won't even answer my questions about it! I've been flying for 50+ years and never had a nightmare like this.

375,Amy MacIver,United States,2022-09-16,1,"If I could give zero stars I would! We were planning a trip to Scotland from the US for over 2 years due to covid, it was canceled back in 2020 ... we booked through Virgin Atlantic, but for some reason we never stepped foot on one of their planes. Delta was great with our first flight to Atlanta, and everything went downhill from there. When the time finally came to board our long flight with KLM, our excitement immediately fizzled. We arrived in Amsterdam and had a 24 hour layover, which we understand happens .... finally after trying to sleep in the airport overnight, it was time to board, at that time the staff announced our flight was delayed due to ""short platform staff"". After about 30-40 minutes they canceled it completely! At this time the staff at the gate would not help, we were sent across the airport, a good 10 minute speed walk, to a self serve kiosk to try to rebook our flight. After waiting an hour and a half in line, (as everyone booked on that plane had to do the same) we were sent an email of a rescheduled booking the airline made, without talking to us, for 2 DAYS later. We finally got to the beginning of the line to talk to someone and the only thing they did was give is a piece of paper with an email address to contact if we had any issues. We were told to keep our receipts as we had to find and pay for our own hotel, food and clothes (as they would not let us get our luggage) even though this was not any fault of our own, and ""maybe get reimbursed"". Two days passed back at the airport, now boarding our plane to Birmingham, as that was now our connecting flight to Scotland. We get on our plane to be delayed now 45 min while we wait for ""late arrivers"" . We get to Birmingham airport to be advised our connection was just now taking off. We try to find a KLM help desk, there was only Air France who refused to help as the connecting flight they booked us for was Loganair,  we were directed to a Gate for Loganair, where there was not a sole to help. Needless to say we were stranded!! We found a customer service desk for swiss airlines, and even though she does not work for KLM or Logan she tried her best to help, gave us KLM's customer service phone number and let us use her phone. after 30 min of hold time someone finally answered and said the next available flight wouldn't be until the next day, after we told him our situation he told us to just get someone at the airport to help .... the airport that had no one to help. Mind you we are how losing 3 days of our vacation! Money thrown out the window so to say. We were advised we should catch a train, the lady from swiss helped us find our luggage and we spent $123 per person to get a train. While we stood there waiting for our luggage to come down to us, we heard about 5 more horror stories on how KLM canceled and screwed them over with no help from staff! We lost 3 days of our 6 day vacation, that's money we lost for our previous hotel booking and car!

Check-in couldn't give me any answer, boarding assured me my luggage was on the cart that was due to be loaded into the plane. However, when I arrived in SOU there was no luggage.  I got an email from SOU Airport that they found my luggage. It had already arrived the day prior. So either the software they track luggage with is garbage or I have been lied to by 2 people. Worst part is though, I have been waiting for any info on the compensation for my unexpected expenses since July 6th with horrible communication from their customer service. All communication is initiated by me, no matter who you speak to you get copy & paste responses, they don't care about your personal situation.

So far 2 hand luggages have been sent through and I am required to call everyday to the airport to see if any bags have come through. Granted the airports are having some baggage issues so why collect my cabin bags? Furthermore no communication of when I would receive my bags, and why can it not all come in one batch? This is unfair and very unprofessional totally disrupting the whole family plans and events that have been cancelled due to non arrival of baggages. If 2 bags could come through, why was the whole lot not sent through. This is unacceptable and damages my respect for KLM and the high esteem I had of the airline.

We moved on to other Greek Islands. They will not take our calls about our lost baggage.

It has now been nearly 30 days, we are back home and no one can tell us where our bag is, whether it will be delivered back to us or when. KLM took too many reservations for travel through Amsterdam knowing that their workforce and the infrastructure of the Amsterdam airport could not handle that many passengers and bags. They claim that they are working the problem but I really don't think they are doing anything but giving up. They have lost thousands of bags and are completely overwhelmed and it is all their fault.

No real line, no directions. There’s only 2 people trying to help 100 tired, stuck, angry people. The staff were super lovely and tried to be helpful but it was obvious KLM is trying to save money on staffing.

415,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2022-06-17,6,"Flew KGL-EBB-AMS-CPH with KLM 15-16 June 2022 on A330-300 and Embraer aircrafts. Check-in online did not work – likely due to summer-overload of passengers in Amsterdam which causes disruptions and delays on the entire route-net. However, the check-in KGL was quick and hassle-free. Access to KLMs 3rd party Pearl lounge was granted due to my Flying Blue gold card. The lounge is well supplied, but of sparse offerings. The arriving aircraft in Kigali came in 1 hour late. The KLM staff called all passengers to gate; after wasting an hour in the gate they came back to the terminal and lounge due to further delays: the aircraft had got another, now technical problem (a clogged engine filter?), which they manage to fix in the airport. However, this added to the delay by another 2 hours. The now 3 hours’ delay followed us the whole way to AMS where most passengers eventually lost onwards connections. All entering and exits to aircrafts were by foot and stairways. Onboard, flights were full, haven’t seen this since before the pandemic. KLMs flight crews onboard are in general patronizing and surly, but they managed well. Food was surprisingly good, seems improving with 3 hot meal options for dinner. Hot snacks provided before landing. Managed to sleep 3 hours on the longhaul. IFE worked wel with individual, tiny screens with movie choices. Headsets provided. WiFi not working? In Amsterdam it took 45 minutes to vacate the aircraft which was taxied to a remote area of the airport. Huge queues in Amsterdam due to summer peak and staff shortages. I was fairly lucky to be rebooked on next AMS-CPH flight departing 2-3 hours later. Lounges in AMS are good, spacious and modern. Despite the delays the last flight and arrival in Copenhagen went well and smooth. CPH airport is a breeze. My inscribed luggage arrived to perfection, despite rebooking, delays, and transfers.

During this time, the food was being distributed and the staff was unable/refused to let me pass by the carts to reach the restroom in economy. My next best option was to run to the restroom located in business class. Once I left the restroom, a flight attendant was waiting outside and immediately asked “where is your seat?” After I explained my situation and even apologized for using the restroom, she rudely said “you were in there for 10 min. You can’t be here and need to stay in your class, we don’t make exceptions here. Please return to your class.” I am hoping that in the future, exceptions can be made in such cases, as I would think that an economy passenger using a business class restroom in an emergency, would be more pleasant to both passengers and staff, than the smell of vomit / cleaning up after a sick passenger.

That was concerning the fruits and the egg. I got the feeling that I had the leftovers. All together that means the catering is not the best in Cape Town.

443,Joe Mcdaid,United Kingdom,2022-04-22,1,"KLM pre pandemic were a good airline. However since covid they have become worse than the budget airlines. My most recent flight really sums up the mess that is KLM at the minute, they lost my bag in Schiphol. Ok this happens and they used to be very good at getting it to you but I guess as a cost saving exercise they’ve switched to a budget courier, so I land Tuesday 19th April without my luggage after I dozens of phone calls, WhatsApp messages I learn it’s somewhere in Schiphol. Once they locate my bag the ship it to Leeds and hand it off to what I can only assume is a man with a van. The companies name is Eagle aviation and at first glance on their website they look professional but once you try and contact them it all goes wrong. They have a premium rate number to call that leaves you on hold for 10-20 minutes then cuts you off, their website has a tracking feature showing an ETA but once this comes and goes how on earth do you get your baggage when they don’t answer emails or calls? I know this is a review of KLM and not the courier company but by giving this company a contract they are by extension a representative of klm and the responsibility lies with klm. A very quick Google search and 2 minutes reading the reviews of said company tells you all you need to know about them yet KLM clearly didn’t do this as I suspect they were just the lowest bidder. So back to klm, after reaching out to them about my bag because I have nowhere else to turn to I’m just fobbed off with “we will look into it and pass your concerns on to the relevant department” I’m really at a loss so I need to start driving around the UK looking for my bag at courier depots?

The other one (dinner) was curry, but with such an awful strong smell that it made you want to open a window. A few tiny cube-shaped dry chicken bits.

The process to check in luggage should have been our first clue. They allowed so many people to pay to check an enormous amount of luggage. The pilot made a joke about how much luggage they were trying to load on the plane as it delayed our takeoff. When we arrived to Amsterdam, our luggage (and about 10 other groups of people) was not on the carousel. One of the other passengers made a comment that this same thing happened last time she flew KLM but she figured it was a fluke and gave them another chance. We are now six days later. There has been absolutely no update. Initially we were promised our luggage later that evening, which seemed reasonable as there were six more flights from Heathrow to Amsterdam that day. As of today, they will give us no update, will not tell us any information about the luggage searching process, and today hung up on me when I asked why we had to fill out the bag inventory again (we completed the inventory and have a confirmation email with the completed form).

452,Harry Boer,Netherlands,2022-04-11,2,"This is not about the flights but before you fly and try to book. Part of the travel experience though. I tried to book an award ticket after being a long time passenger with KLM. Nothing wrong with the flights and they are nothing special, business or economy, KLM pretend to be better than they really are, but generally the flights are ok. I wanted to book an award ticket and didn’t succeed as the app kept gave an error on the payment page. It kept doing it. So I tried to call them. To have them book it that way. As it’s an award ticket that has to be with their ‘Flying Blue’ desk. They were closed at that time. So I tried to use KLM’ WhatsApp option. No answer, till this very day. So I tried to book the ticket again the next morning, required points had gone up double!! So I try to call again to have the issue solved. Automatic disconnection of the call as waiting times to long the voice said. So I tried a day later, points gone up even higher. After 40 minutes finally got a hold of the FB desk. To have them tell me they can’t help me and the points required are what they are and I should have called earlier! They should have picked up the phone earlier they mean. What a terrible service and no solution offered. So their app doesn’t work as it should and you can’t get a hold of them and they don’t help and say you should have called earlier. They basically say, “tough luck and all not our fault, can’t and won’t help”. Very very disappointing and I will think twice before I book any ticket with KLM again.

455,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2022-04-04,8,"Flew CPH-AMS-KGL with KLM on 2-3 April 2022. Both flights on time or early. Check-in online and again at desk in CPH was smooth (Sky Priority). Their internet interphase works nicely in every aspect with full access to the booking. Luggage was a bit overweight and was labelled “Heavy”. It was inscribed to final destination where it arrived in good order. Boarding / de-boarding were easy and on jetbridges, except at final destination where a bus took us 150 meter (no carbon prize!) from aircraft to arrival hall. I chose to travel to AMS a day earlier than strictly needed to be sure to catch my onward morning flight AMS to KGL. The trip became a relief due to full utilisation of gold card privileges. This trip costed me less than 500 USD, and the return legs still remains. Extremely good value for money – and it earns me 46 X-points toward retention of my elite status at KLM. Was given a huge luggage allowance, 2 x 23 kg) that I decided not to fully use. CPH->AMS Aircraft was a newer B737-8. Saturday evening flight, not many passengers – I got myself an entire 3-seats section. The service onboard was good and snacks and plenty of drinks were handed out generously (incl. wine and beer). Two-three drink rounds were provided within this 55 Minutes flight is fine. Call bells addressed instantly. Can’t fault this airline – as good as it gets in economy. Lounges on the way… KLM offers 2 lounge in CPH: the third-party lounges Carlsberg Aviator and Aviator Apartments. Both were nice, tidy, and airy. Good view of tarmac. The draft beers (3 kinds) in the Carlsberg lounge tastes for some reason better than those poured in town. Upon arrival to Amsterdam I chose the non-Schengen KLM Lounge 25, which was more than OK and presentable though no without any extravagancy. They closed at 10 p.m. For the night I found a sleeping area until morning where I went to the Sky Team “Lounge 52” in non-Schengen area. Impressive design, views. Amble space. Showers. Breakfast was outstanding with fresh, hot delicious breads. AMS->KGL A330-200 aircraft. Flight arrived on time, though departing 20 min. late. Smooth seating and embarking procedures. Onboard, I was greeted by name and offered an upgrade for 64k Flying Blue miles which I declined as economy offers amble space these days. Premium economy was offered for 14k, but the armrests can’t be lifted so economy is a better deal when economy is only 65% full. KLM provides only a single meal service on this 7 hours’ flight which is too little. While a lunch is served at 12 o’clock, there is no supper prior to landing in Kigali, where one has to deal with lengthy immigration and Covid-testing procedures. The food was passable. Drinks were served reluctantly and only offered upon firm requests or by walks to the galley. Bell for service calls were rarely addressed. Symptomatically, I was offered hot drinks only once on this long-haul flight. IFE has improved since last year and more options offered.

I’m on the phone as I type this trying to get to them and I have been waiting for 53 minutes now. I don’t even think my request is this complicated as I just want to change my flight schedule. I called last week and an agent confirmed the change but mentioned that a recalculation would have to be done and that I would get an email after 24 hours. I waited for 72 hours without any feedback so I proactively reached out only to be told that we should be reaching out to our local KLM office for the change and was given a contact number which never gets answered for 24 hours straight so I called again and this time a third agent said it appears the first agent never sent any email for the recalculation and confirmed he has sent the email and that it will take 96 hours to hear back. I asked what if I don’t hear back after 96 hours and he replied I would have to call back. At this point, I am not really comfortable so I ask for a contact to the local office. He gave me another number to contact our local office which unsurprisingly doesn’t get answered. I finally was able to get through after some google search and this agent has no idea what is going on. I have to literally tell him my flight schedule and everything. I wonder if all the agents use the same system. It’s ridiculous and with the frequent long silence during the calls without any prompts, you wonder if the agents know what they are doing. At this point I’m so helpless and wondering if there is any help out there. In this day and age, customer care is everything and wondering why KLM isn’t taking theirs seriously.

459,E Allen,Netherlands,2022-03-25,1,"At about 11.30pm on March 18th, I was notified that my flight from Amsterdam to Geneva at 12.20pm the next day (March 19th) was cancelled. Due to existing plans in Geneva that day, my only option for rebooking was at 7am — which meant that I needed to be at the airport at 5am. Needless to say, after packing and traveling to the airport, I didn't get more than an hour or two of sleep that night. It was awful. After arriving in Geneva, I received a notification that I could request compensation for the cancelled flight. So I followed the link and did that. I received a total of €269.12 back. Today, I received an email to check-in for my return flight from Geneva to Amsterdam (scheduled for tomorrow). When I followed the check-in process, I received an error that I needed to call KLM. When I called, they told me that when I applied for compensation from my previous flight cancellation, it automatically cancelled my return flight. KLM then told me that I would need to buy my return flight. Currently, that costs €1,659. So, to sum up: 1) KLM cancelled my flight 2) KLM offered €269.12 compensation then cancelled my return flight 3) KLM tells me I need to pay €1,659 for the return flight. I should also mention that I'm a KLM Flying Blue member with status and a KLM/Air France Amex card. After talking with customer service for an hour, they told me that there was nothing they could do.

460,N Malzeen,United Kingdom,2022-03-24,1,"I have flown between the UK and Kenya many times before with numerous other airlines, and KLM is the only one I would never fly with again. The only good thing I have to say about them is that the seats are OK and they have half-decent food. My initial flight from Leeds to Amsterdam was smooth enough (it was too short for them to mess up), but then the flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi was delayed by over an hour. We were not given any explanation beyond ""unforeseen circumstances"". I expressed concern to a stewardess about my connecting flight to Mombasa very soon after takeoff (I would have done so earlier but was ignored multiple times when I tried to get the attention of cabin crew members). She said it was too early to know if there would be an issue with me making my connecting flight and that we might make up a lot of time during the journey. However, when we landed, I had under an hour to get through passport control, collect my bags in Nairobi, go through customs, walk to Domestic Departures, go through security and get onto the plane! I expressed my concerns to another stewardess as I was leaving the flight, and she assured me that staff on the ground would help me. However, in practice, I ended up having to be proactive and beg members of staff for help. I ended up making it onto the connecting flight 10 minutes before departure purely through my own efforts. It was the last flight of the day. I do not know if I would have had any help from KLM had I missed it and been forced to spend the entire night in the airport in Nairobi. I had zero intimation from them that I would have received any kind of compensation or been booked into a hotel for the night. They completely washed their hands of me the moment I stepped off the plane. Absolutely appalling and despicable customer service, especially to a solo female traveller.

473,S Kersen,United States,2022-02-01,1,"Visited Tromsø, Noway (TOS) Dec 2021 to see Northern Lights. Checked into my return flights (TOS-BER, AMS-AAL) on Dec 29 online about 10am for a Dec 30 departure; and everything looked good. Midday on Dec 29 (ie less than 24 hours before departure) I got email that one of the flights (AMS-AAL) had been cancelled and that KLM were looking at options. We could not extend our hotel and could find no other hotel options in/near TOS (it is a relative small, and VERY remote town) so I immediately tried to contact KLM (Holland #) to determine flight options. I got an automated message that ""We have more than 45 min wait time; please try your call later"", and call was disconnected. For the rest of the day, I called about once an hour with same result. In the mean time (around 6pm) I got another automated email that they had rebooked my itinerary on Jan 2nd. This was complete useless for several reasons. There were no hotels to be had in TOS, and we had flight back to US on Jan 2nd that we would miss. Finally that evening I called KLM # in US and was put into a call que. After 1.5 hour wait (at huge long distance fee), I got through to an agent and explained situation, and the agent essentially said ""tough luck"". KLM would not help find hotels in TOS, nor help us get out of town; eg if KLM had left my first two flights intact we would get to AMS, with lot better chance of finding a hotel and there were several options to get to AAL from AMS the following day, but KLM would not budge. I then asked KLM to switch me to nearly destination airport (BLL instead of ALL) and we could take a 2 hour train ride from BLL to ALL. KLM's own system showed such a flight with 7 seats available on Dec 30. However, KLM wanted more than $1000/ticket to make the change. When I insisted that KLM do something to help us out - leaving us stranded in TOS for 2 days without hotel rooms, wasn't really an option, they hung up on me. In we end we ended up buying completely separate ticket on different airline (SAS) at $500/ticket for Dec 30, and we are now fighting with KLM about getting a refund, which a different (and also not a happy story) What really got to me, was that KLM had several good options that they would have deployed:  KLM had a flight on Dec 30 to a nearly airport that would work, but they wanted completely unrealistic change fee (around $1000/ticket). They could have put us on the Dec 30 SAS flight (cost about $500/ticket) - same flights that we purchased ourselves.

When I requested our new itinerary, she stated “the counter is closing I will not do that.” I informed her that the agent at gate E69 directed us to this counter for help. She continued to say that there are no more flights and that she did not need to be there. After continuously expressing that we were auto booked and don’t even know our flight numbers, she reluctantly printed our itinerary. Furthermore, we communicated that we did not know the travel documentation requirements for Amsterdam. However, she only stated that the US requires a negative COVID test. We showed her our passports, negative antigen tests, and documentation of recovery. She was unwilling to tell us what documents were needed for our route.  As part of the US entry requirements, we were prepared with official documentation of recovery documents that met the CDC guidelines. These documents were verified by multiple travel agencies and licensed physicians and met all requirements for documentation of recovery. She refused to acknowledge that these met the US guidelines and stated “No. It is my rule, I decide what is accepted and what is not accepted. This will not be accepted.” When we offered to show her the CDC checklists for airlines, she threatened to cancel our booking and began scanning our passports into the computer.  Refusal to escalate the issue to her superiors or identify herself as a KLM employee. As the discussion escalated, we asked to speak with another agent or supervisor. She refused to contact anyone else. We said we needed help, that our flight was canceled and that we needed information about our new route. She stated, “I am closing the counter this isn’t my problem.” ",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Boston via Amsterdam,January 2022,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Madrid,Boston,Amsterdam,Negative,-0.9001,  arrive madrid airport morning january 29 2022 present relevant documentation include passport proof covid vaccination negative covid test per lisbon requirement documentation recovery per united state requirement arrive gate e69 approximately cancel due severe weather tap automatically rebooked us follow day january 30 2022 receive email notice communicate new itinerary ask agent itinerary new information express concern regard covid documentation requirement new connection amsterdam prepared documentation connection lisbon portugal sympathetic situation inform unable provide additional information print itinerary instruct us speak agent service counter passenger check baggage per suggestion go desk approximately communicate situation agent service counter subject behavior agent inability reluctance provide pertinent information us regard travel reservation request new itinerary state counter closing informed agent gate e69 direct us counter help continue say flight need continuously express auto book know number reluctantly print itinerary furthermore communicate know travel documentation requirement amsterdam however state us require negative covid test show passport negative antigen test documentation recovery unwilling tell us document need route part us entry requirement prepare official documentation recovery document meet cdc guideline document verified multiple travel agency license physician meet requirement documentation recovery refuse acknowledge meet us guideline state rule decide accept accepted offer show cdc checklist airline threaten cancel booking begin scan passport computer refusal escalate issue superior identify employee discussion escalate asked speak another agent supervisor refuse contact anyone else say need help cancel need information new route state closing counter problem

Seats and seat pitch are good, even for someone over 1.90 meters, middle seat was empty. Service was not great, to say the least. Staff was not very attentive, they did not seem to care for their passengers. A small meal was provided minutes after take-off, but … in a box. Horrible presentation. I know that there are different opinions about this, but I think it looks shabby, given the business class fare. Staff disappeared after the meal service. Overall, a flight (2.15 h) that gave me very mixed feelings, but perfectly on time. I would certainly not consider KLM if I had to pay a full fare. Even the upgrade fee was, in hindsight, too much.

As with the outbound leg, I had to check-in using the Air France website because the KLM one wouldn’t let me. There was no welcome drink or a pre-meal drink, nothing until the meal service. Even the crew have been told not to talk to the passengers much. In business class the meal was a 1 tray small meal, about what you would expect in economy. The stewardess got me some nut and nibbles so I could feel as though I had had something. You have to use their headphones as they have changed all the connectors to a 3-point magnetic style. I don’t blame the cabin crew, they are just under instructions. I needn’t have worried about my connection as that flight was cancelled as well with the weather, even though others were flying.

Qr-checks at Schiphol rather straight forward nowadays, so no long waiting, but it was a quiet Wednesday evening between Christmas and New Year.

487,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2021-12-22,7,"Flew KGL-EBB-AMS-CPH 20 December 2021. First 2 legs on A330-200 business class while the last was on an Embraer-190 in Economy. Travel preparations went smooth. An early announced cancellation postponed my travel 1 day which was fine – I also modified it further to ensure amble time in AMS in my new favorite KLM lounge at Gate 52. I had a cheap Economy ticket but decided to upgrade by Miles at check-in in Kigali Airport. To my surprise it was very easy and quick – paid 75600 miles (KGL-EBB-AMS). Lounge in Kigali was Pearl Lounge: acceptable, spacious, good savory snacks, hot foods, and uncrowded. Drink supply of very poor options – the provisions are degrading more and more since 2018. Lack of quality mitigated by quantity – liquid enough was present – even for the thirsty. I even had a shower and was given the amenities for it (towels, kit, etc.). Boarding included a ridiculous early call from the lounge to sit and stare in gate for 45 Minutes prior to an awkward, superfluous bus-gating for 300 meter, degrading business class feeling to cattle class. Upgrade was worth it as the plane was overly full due to X-mas. Only 2 seats left in business and had to change seat in EBB (from 1A to 2B) in a 2x2x2 straight configuration. That was fine for me. Aircraft old – and the hard and soft product including the FA’s was in general was a bit retro old-fashioned, but acceptable and solid, though conform. FAs on KLM are very firm limiting to surly and arrogant, having forgot what true service, customer care, positivism, and respect is. First leg, 40 Minutes, offered only champagne and a drink round. No options of beer apart from the imposed monopolizing Heineken brand. Snacks offered were industrial prepacks, one worse than the other. Seat lie flats, big monitors, and IFE offerings were very limited but functioning – incl. noise reduction headsets provided. Wi-Fi offered for payment up to 30 EUR in business class- a disgracing rip-off. Food and drink offerings acceptable, not world class. Breakfast in a tray without any exotic offerings. Tea is a joke, they provide a teabag which you have to put into lukewarm water – eventually becomes only 50-60 degrees hot which can’t do any tea any justice – should be boiled with the leaves. Coffee below all standards. Amenity kit were given out, though boring composition, not worth to take along. Lounge 52 in Amsterdam is very good – I spent easily 4 hours there and got service from the KLM helpdesks. They recovered a lost luggage tag within 1 Minute. Next flight AMS-CPH was delayed 80 Minutes which is unacceptable. They changed Aircraft in last Minute. Had a reasonable experience in Economy with full service despite full.

494,Eelco van den Heuvel,Netherlands,2021-12-12,10,"KLM is starting to become my favourite airline. Again two flawless flights: Amsterdam-Bonaire and Curaçao-Amsterdam. One of the best things: ground staff (well, in Amsterdam, definitely not in Curaçao) en crew. We were greeted at Schiphol by a very friendly lady, who made a chat. Due to Covid checks we were advised to check in at least 3 hrs before our flight, but we were at the gate within 30 minutes. We decided to treat ourselves to lounge access for 100 euro in total. KLM's Crown Lounge is okay, but not sure I would do it again. Boarding in groups and punctual departure. Tasty meals - although a bit small - and enough drinks. I like the fact that they have a self service with drinks and snacks in the pantry. Very friendly crew. We were on the very last row in J and K, which is the only row in the 777 economy that had two seats. We liked that very much, because there is no-one beside you and you have more lag space.

495,A Harene,United States,2021-12-12,1,What a nightmare. Air France cancels my flight and schedules a flight that overlaps the next leg which means we will not make the connecting flight to JFK. Worse part is I cannot get ahold of anyone. I booked thru KLM. Called and would get an auto response after many prompts that the wait time is more than 45 mins so I am disconnected and instructs me to call back or go to their web site with all these great tools. Called back several times and the same response. Went to the web site and states I cannot reschedule my flight and to call their service line. Air France is worse. On hold for an hour multiple times then I get disconnected and the response tells me they can't help me right now. So I call back at 3:30am thinking it will be slower and I can get through. No-go. Recording states their call center is closed.  I depart in 10 days and I have no way of getting this fixed. Never had a leg rescheduled that conflicted with the full route.

498,Gavin Morrison,United Kingdom,2021-12-06,10,I flew Glasgow to Budapest return via Amsterdam for a weekend trip. Flights to and from GLA/AMS were on Cityhopper. Embraers are great aircraft for the short flight and the 2x2 seating is nice. AMS to BUD rtn were on KLM mainline 737s. Again seat was comfortable for the short flights. Transferring at AMS can be a real pain but that isn’t KLM’s fault. Cabin crew on mainline and cityhopper were very polite and professional; mainline crew have the edge though and it is nice to see the stripes on their uniforms identifying seniority. Free beer/wine and soft drinks on all flights is very welcome. Sandwich given on both flights too which was fine for short flight.

499,S Gorsey,United Kingdom,2021-12-04,6,"KLM is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. Flight LCY - AMS got cancelled, which was a big negative and ruined my plans for the day. However, KLM promptly rebooked me on an earlier flight with BA. This leg with BA was quite enjoyable. The KLM Crown lounge at AMS was amazing, possibly, the most well-designed lounge I’ve been to : huge, yet cozy and has a great quiet area. The leg from AMS to SVO was nice, although with a pinch of salt. On one hand, the latest Recaro seats were very comfortable (even though being the same Economy seats), food was okay (although no better), crew monitored mask-wearing strictly and the purser was very nice and extremely helpful. On the other hand, soft product was very limited. No blankets and pillows (i understand it was only a 3-hour flight however, it was a red-eye arriving at 2am at SVO), no pre-departure drinks, no amenity kits. I was disgusted by one crew’s attitude. One of the passengers asked her something and instead, she rudely and in a clearly discriminating way demanded him to show his boarding pass to prove he was indeed in business class, no apology whatsoever. If i were that passenger, I would have filed a huge complaint to the airline. All in all, I am not complaining given that the flight was relatively cheap (£200 one way + €99 upgrade to business). However, I saw that KLM usually prices the AMS - SVO tickets similar to Aeroflot (c.£1,400 round trip), which has a million miles superior product and thus, for such a price, I would deem an experience to be completely unacceptable.",Embraer E190 / Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London City to Moscow via Amsterdam,December 2021,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,,4,yes,True,London City,Moscow,Amsterdam,Positive,0.9627,  like box chocolate never know go get lcy am get cancelled big negative ruin plan day however promptly rebooked earlier ba leg ba quite enjoyable crown lounge am amaze possibly lounge huge yet cozy great quiet area leg ams svo nice although pinch salt one hand late recaro seat comfortable though economy seat food okay although good crew monitor strictly purser nice extremely helpful hand soft product limited blanket pillow understand however arrive 2am svo drink amenity kit disgust one crew attitude one passenger ask something instead rudely clearly discriminate way demand show board pas prove indeed business class apology whatsoever passenger file huge complaint complain give relatively cheap one way upgrade business however saw usually price ams svo ticket similar aeroflot round trip million mile superior product thus price deem experience completely unacceptable

Getting out of the plane, we decide to still go at the gate and see that we really missed out flight, since anyway it was the last flight to Ibiza that day.

515,Anders Pedersen,Vietnam,2021-10-15,8,"Flew Copenhagen to Kigali via Amsterdam on my birthday 13th Oct. 2021. Both flights on time or early. Luggage handled perfectly and smoothly. Check-in at desk in CPH smooth (Sky Priority) but other passengers had long waiting times. Lounges provided prior to both departures. Boardings / deboardings were easy and on jetbridges, except when leaving at final destination. Leg 1: CPH-AMS In Copenhagen airport, lounge was provided to Aviators’ Atelier Relaxium Business Lounge – hard name to remember. Surprisingly, it was open even at these inhuman ultra-early morning hours from 05 a.m. The lounge was good with solid buffet breakfast, mainly cold, tasty sandwiches on newly baked, hot bread, “rundstykker”. Aircraft was a well maintained B737-8. Despite being full, the service onboard was granted smoothly, including a good variety of snacks and cold and hot drinks. To my surprise, KLM had learned that I had birthday and congratulated me by name in front of other passengers in the fully packed aircraft. They then provided a handwritten, personal greeting and gave me a bottle of champagne on a tray with a design glass. Nice touch and icebreaker in an otherwise cold, surly, silent, morning atmosphere at 6 a.m. Lounge in Amsterdam provided was the KLM Sky Team “Lounge 52” in non-Schengen area. Very, very impressive design, views. Spacious was incredible. Must be the biggest lounge in Europe with 1500 seats? The drinks and dining was not up to the lounge appearance. No Asian dishes available, even noodles. Only one beer brand is offered in the entire lounge: Heineken – they must have paid a lot for this monopoly? 1st floor a la carte restaurant (food for purchase) while downstairs all the buffets and bars and other “areas” dominates. Leg 2: AMS-KGL On an A330 ageing plane. Flight arrived on time, though departing 20 min. late. Smooth seating and embarking procedures. Was greeted by name. Elite status and some ground work in Lounge with KLM eventually earned me an entire row for myself (4 seats) which was appreciated in an almost full plane though IFE was not working in that row. IFE was poor, old, and many passengers could not make it work. WiFi was present but neither really useful nor accessible. FAs were walking around in raincoats making them sweat, ridiculous, slow, and uncomfortable. Two hot meals were provided within this 8-hours trip. Food quality was substandard, just palatable. I had prepaid a special “Celebration Meal” which was delivered to perfection, but the food quality was not up to specifications and turned out to be just palatable. The meal costed me 35 USD which was not worth it as I was consequently, unknowingly deprived of the standard meals as for other passengers.

Instead I felt like I'm traveling a budget airline. Despite cabin being half full, attendants were always busy with something else except passengers. No welcome drink was offered, like other airlines do. After I asked for it, flight attendant brought me only part of what I asked, saying ""I didn't know you asked for something else"". Empty glasses were removed after almost 4 hours sitting on my table. I didn't get a breakfast before landing, per flight attendant ""because you were slipping at that time"", but I saw staff passed me 4 or 5 times.

519,P Varmova,United Kingdom,2021-10-02,1,"Two times flew with KLM - and really never again. What happened with their customer service? It's worse than terrible - it's non-existent. One of my KLM flights was delayed and we had a very short connection. I was told by KLM crew when we were in air that I won't make it to the next plane (also with KLM) and to go and exchange my ticket. They didn't even let me disembark from the plane first so I could try to make it to the next leg. The service desk they directed me to was an automated kiosk that offered me a flight in 24 hours! I then had to find a service desk with people and wait for 45 min to be served. The customer service representative then told me that apparently I would have made it to the plane if I ran and questioned me about who told me that I was not going to make it to the plane. Lesson learned - do not trust what KLM flight crew tells you. My other flight that I booked on a different date (with a much longer connection) - the ticket says I can change the dates at any time. When you go to the app, it says ""sorry, you cannot change online, please contact us"". After 1.5h on the phone waiting for them to pick up - no response. Their so called ""24/7"" social media customer service is of course also non-responsive. It's an absolute joke.

520,N Birley,Ireland,2021-09-30,5,"Hugely disappointed with KLM at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Flying with them was fine, but the staff at the airport were terrible. I arrived at the airport 2 hrs pre-departure, plenty of time considering I had checked in online and wasn't checking a bag. The queue to check-in/get my boarding pass was a disaster - not moving for 40 mins, and then at a snail's pace for another 45. Every passenger seemed to have a problem & huge delay, but more consequentially, the staff were just slow, and far, far too relaxed. There was no organisation of the queue or the time being taken. Eventually I went to the neighbouring line, supposed to be for another flight, where the staff I dealt with started to produce my boarding pass (all I needed!), but got distracted and left me. Another one finally gave me the boarding pass, and at this time all my delay margin had been used up, and I had to run through control and to the security at the (distant) gate, sweating, breaking my carrier bag, creating the worst possible start to a long, multi-stop journey. Every individual staff member I dealt with at the check-in desk was: rude, unhelpful, completely apathetic whether I caught my flight or not, unprofessionally having relaxed conversations with colleagues while ignoring passengers - all who were anxious directly because of them. The system itself must also be questioned where slower, bag-dropping passengers are queuing with those already checked in and are not expecting such a slow line. A group of kids ahead of me in the queue - who caused much of the delay - were fast-tracked to the gate, I wasn't given that option despite being behind them, and barely told which direction to walk in (getting a scoff when I asked). Again - the staff on board - fine, efficient and friendly and the service is good, and the pilot's communication excellent. But Belgrade's check-in staff - with their incompetence, unprofessionalism and lack of regard, caused massive stress, and ruined my day.",,Business,Economy Class,Belgrade to Dublin via Amsterdam,September 2021,2.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,1.0,3,yes,True,Belgrade,Dublin,Amsterdam,Negative,-0.9589,  hugely disappointed belgrade nikola tesla airport fly fine staff airport terrible arrive airport 2 hr plenty time consider checked online check bag queue board pas disaster move 40 min snail pace another 45 every passenger seem problem huge delay consequentially staff slow far far relaxed organisation queue time take eventually go neighbour line suppose another staff dealt start produce board pas need get distracted leave another one finally give board pas time delay margin use run control security distant gate sweat break carrier bag create bad possible start long journey every individual staff member dealt desk rude unhelpful completely apathetic whether caught unprofessionally relaxed conversation colleague ignore passenger anxious directly system must question slow passenger queue already check expect slow line group kid ahead queue cause much delay gate give option despite behind barely direction walk get scoff ask staff board fine efficient friendly service good pilot communication excellent belgrade staff incompetence unprofessionalism lack regard cause massive stress ruin day

522,S Derzeny ,United Kingdom,2021-09-11,3,"Budapest - via Amsterdam - to Aberdeen. The departures and arrivals were punctual, the flights were smooth and pleasant -- would have been pleasant but there were stressful because of the other conditions. Already at the check-in desk in Budapest they took my small Samsonite hand luggage from me saying that the flight was fully booked and my boarding pass contained a label 'Hand baggage not guaranteed in cabin'. It is a small 2-wheeled suitcase, I have been using it for years, it has never been taken from me. That is, it was not prepared for this kind of transportation (it was not locked, for example). Of course, the flight was not fully booked at all, approx. 70-80% of the seats were occupied, and there's a lot of free luggage space in the cabin. Then the worst part ensued: it was an almost one-hour waiting in a aprrox. 150m-long queue at the gate D8 (the queue stared at D2) with the passengers of UK flights for checking our documents (covid tests, passenger locator forms, etc.). We were not informed at all about what would happen when the time of closing gate was coming. One of the few helpers from KLM told me that there's no any guarantee that I could reach my flight to Aberdeen. In the 45th mintue of my ""sojourn"" in this queue I got the first sms from KLM, that my flight's gate was closing... Finally, when I was already sure that I missed my connecting flight, another helper of KLM cried around for passengers to Aberdeen then we (approx. 15-20 of us) had to run after her to the gate.

526,Farah Abdul Hafeez,United Arab Emirates,2021-09-01,1,"KLM put me through a real ordeal earlier this August. I had booked a flight to visit my family in Canada a month before my travel date of August 12th 2021. I started to prepare all the necessary documentation required for my entry to Calgary, Canada. Closer to the date of my departure, I had yet to receive my approval from the IRCC Canada to be able to enter the country. Wondering if I should postpone my flight dates, I called the KLM helpline, they were unable to give me any information and informed me that only the airport would be able to give me accurate information as to whether I could fly or not. After being told that I could get a full refund if they do not allow me to board the flight due to the COVID restrictions, I would be able to get a full refund on my full purchased ticket. With this information, I packed my bags and headed to the airport with plenty of time to spare, in case anything were to go wrong. Once at the KLM check-in desk, at the Dubai Airport, I handed all the documentation I had and the KLM representative started the process of printing the boarding passes. I interrupted him and mentioned that I did not have the approval from the IRCC which was stated as a requirement on their ""travel doc"" site. He assured me that I would not need it, I told him to please check for me to make sure, because I did not want to be stranded anywhere, he got up of his seat and proceeded to a team leader or a manager on duty and then assured me again that I would be able to fly and would not have any issues transiting through Amsterdam or entering Canada. With this information, I was very relieved and informed him that I was not prepared to fly today as I thought that that would be a requirement, but just for the sake of trying I decided to get the information first hand at the airport. He then mentioned to me that there was not a problem because I have all the other documentation which are important except for the approval which is fine. Long story short, once I arrived at my point of transit Amsterdam, they did not let me board the flight to Calgary, and informed me that I needed the IRCC approval to get on the plane. Completely distraught and disappointed, I took the next flight back to Dubai, leaving an hour later. That was how I spent my entire day, was lied to by a KLM representative who I put my trust in, and stuck on a plane for over 13 hours with over 5 hours of layover. When I decided to take up the matter with KLM customer care, they admitted to their mistake but still refused to give me a full refund for my full ticket flight that was completely wasted. I spent a total of AED 4,955 for the flight which was not returned. I then had to spend a lot more money trying to book a last minute flight to Calgary with another airline once the approval came out. I have never been more annoyed and insulted with KLM's deceitful actions.

531,D Paniccia,Canada,2021-08-20,1,"My 10 month old baby and I had to fly from Manchester to Toronto and we connected in Amsterdam. Before getting on the plane, we handed over my baby's stroller which was supposed to meet us at our connection in Amsterdam, however it never did. The flight attendants were amazing (the only good part of the experience) and tried to help us find it, even the pilot himself came to try and help, however he informed us that someone made a mistake and never put a tag on the stroller so it went straight through to Toronto. This was just the first bump in the whole catastrophe that was my experience with KLM. I then had to carry my 10 month old along with my bag throughout the airport and wait for our next flight. Anyone with a baby can respect that workout. I was a bit upset but understood that things happen. We finally got on our plane to Toronto and after a very long day we go to get our bags and as soon as I saw the stroller bag a KLM employee walked over to me because he could see that our stroller bag was ripped to shreds. As soon as I took the stroller out it appeared as though it was hit by a car. The wheels were barely holding on, the frame was bent and even her car seat and adaptors were broken and would no longer connect into the stroller or car seat base. This bag was clearly thrown around enough that even her blanket which was inside the car seat was ripped. This was my first time ever flying with my daughter. It was stressful enough without all of this happening but again I understand that these things can happen. The KLM employee had me fill out paperwork and explain what each product was and an estimate of how much they were. He provided me with a number which later on, proved to be useless. They said to call KLM when I got home to quarantine (Canada 2 week mandatory quarantine). I called KLM when I got home and explained everything. They told me I would be contacted in 2 days. 2 days passed and still nothing so I called again. I then got a manager named Rocky who told me I would be contacted in a week. Once again, I was never contacted. I then called again and pressed the prompt to see the status of the claim and I was put on the phone with a man. The only thing he was able to do was give me the claim number that I had already provided him with. He said that he was in sales (I don't know why that prompt brought me to sales) and told me that I needed to get in touch with customer service. I asked him if he could forward me to them and he said he was not able to. I then asked if I could speak to a manager and he said he did not know who his manager was. Keep in mind each time I called I was on hold for 2-3+ hours. And multiple times I was on hold for 3 hours or more and they would hang up. I could honestly go on forever about all of the specific things that this company did but to avoid writing a novel here ... long story short I did not hear back until more than a month later. And the only reason I did hear back was because I contacted KLM's media department who I was not supposed to contact about claims but I had no clue what to do anymore and wanted to try anything possible.

533,N Carl ,Sweden,2021-08-10,1,"Inexistent customer service! I haven't even made the trip yet and will probably not fly with these chaps again. And unfortunately this is probably the way out for national carriers when they try to imitate instead of compete with low price airlines. There is absolutely no way of getting in touch with a live human being at KLM except 1 global american phone number which of course always is over-jammed with calls. They go out of their way to not have to speak to their customers and redirect you to chat bots via whatsapp och facebook messenger. They even don't have any numbers for their local ticket offices (because of course those they still have?). My request is a little unusual with special baggage and can't be handled by a simple chat bot flow chart.

534,Ivana Dobrikova,Bulgaria,2021-08-09,1,"I purchased tickets for May 2020 with KLM - New Delhi - Amsterdam - Bucharest. I couldn't fly at this time because of the virus outbreak. I received a travel voucher. I decided to exchange my voucher into cash in May 2021 because I wasn't going to use it. I filled the form online in order to do so. In the field ""Remarks"" I wrote clearly that the bank account that I originally purchased the tickets with is now closed and I would like to be contacted via email before the money transfer so that I could provide the employees with details of my functioning bank account and receive the amount. Instead of being contacted, I received an email that the money was transferred to my old bank account. I contacted my old bank immediately and they explained to me that if an amount gets sent to a non-existing bank account, it automatically returns to the sender account within few days. I have been in contact with KLM service agents via chat and explained the situation, asking them to process another refund. They asked for a document certifying that my old bank account is closed and that my old credit card doesn't function. I provided them with this document, issued from my old bank. Afterwards, they didn't process a new refund as they said they will, instead they told me that sometimes it could take up to 2 months for the amount that was sent to my closed bank account to return to them and that I will receive the amount on my new bank account after 2 months. 2 months have passed on the 5/08 and I have received nothing from them, no refund, no email informing me about the refund being processed. I wrote a reclamation on their website 1 month ago explaining everything because the only time when I could actually reach their customer service via phone, the employee told me that writing a reclamation is the only way to process my demand and that he cannot help me on the phone. I have received no answer to my reclamation. Customer service is impossible to reach via phone, and in Messenger/Whatsapp they reply within a day. Then you have to wait for another day for them to reply to your next message. When they do so, they ask the same questions that were already answered by me one day ago, leaving me with the impression that they haven't red the previous text messages. This really slows down the refund process, creates confusion and a feeling of complete disorder. After 2 months of fighting to receive my refund and no results, I am outraged by the incompetency of the customer service and the disorganization within this company. I have seen nothing from my 200 euros ticket refund.

At the first leg at Guarulhos Airport to Amsterdam, I flew in one of the most uncomfortable seats in my life (that's my wife's opinion as well), and I can say that I have some mileage regarding national and international travels. The food was good, and it was served three times. A small lunch when we departed, a dinner during the night, and a good coffee with some snacks before the arrival at Amsterdam. The airline mentioned that the flight were supposed to have onboard wifi, but that wasn't true. At least, the onboard entertainment catalog was ok. The second leg, from Amsterdam to Göteborg-Landvetter was extremely pleasant. The Embraer airplane was very comfortable and roomy. We booked a seat with extra leg space, but I felt that wouldn't be necessary for this flight.

The check-in staff for KLM at Incheon airport were awful, however. Despite my final destination being Manchester, the check-in lady refused to send my bag there. I explained to her that I cannot leave airside in the Netherlands as I do not have a visa, therefore I need my bag to be sent to Manchester. She didn’t care and simply had it unloaded in Amsterdam.

549,C Bolt,United States,2021-04-21,3,"I had other choices, but because of past pleasant experiences and the good reputation of KLM, I chose this. I realize that travel during COVID is complicated, and KLM surely made it even more so. Please let me outline my major issues: 1) First, I had trouble in the weeks leading up to my travel finding out what tests I needed to transit through Amsterdam and how I could get a PCR test that was given on 72 hours before landing in Amsterdam, yet be sure that I would receive the results on time. I realize that this is not KLM’s rule, but the people at KLM were not very helpful in guiding me on how to do this. I was told, “Other people do it, so you figure it out.” I was able to get more information from Delta. 2) The day before I left, I got an email that my flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain had been cancelled and I was rerouted through London. That was also what was shown on the KLM website, however, the Delta website had the original itinerary on it. When I got to the airport to check in, I was assured that my flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain had not been cancelled. To be sure, I asked the gate agent when I got to the gate. I was again told that I was on the originally booked flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain. However, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I found that was not the case. 3) There was no one to greet those of us on the canceled flight and tell us what to do - no signs, no guidance at all. 4) Being unable to check in at the automated site, after several attempts, I found that I had to go to the KLM transit office. The KLM person there asked for my COVID test results, and I showed her the printout of the result I had received. She said it was unacceptable! It was the official result that had been downloaded from the website, but she kept telling me it was unacceptable.Then, she told me I needed a copy of the visa to get into Bahrain, I always get the visa when I get there. She then told me that I did not have the correct paperwork to go through England. I was tired and frustrated. KLM sent me through London, then tells me I don’t have the correct paperwork to go through London! I had a copy of the quick COVID test that I had done Monday morning with my doctor’s signature, and she finally accepted that. I got my colleague at Arabian Gulf University to send me an electronic copy of the visa, and she accepted that. Then, before boarding, KLM agents wanted to see my COVID test results again. Fearing the same response, I also showed them my vaccination card that showed I had gotten two doses of Moderna in February. I was finally allowed to board the plane. Poor communication, poor customer service, lack of information. 5) When I got to London, I had no problems with my Corona Test Result report downloaded from the internet, and they did not ask for the visa. Poor communication. 6) When I arrived in Bahrain the day after I was supposed to arrive, my luggage was not there. Several passengers, those of us who were rerouted through London, did not have our luggage. I filed a missing luggage report. 7) I didn't get my luggage for two days, and I had to go pick it up from the airport.

550,Teodora Mechea,Sweden,2021-04-16,1,"This was, hands down, the most out-of-this-world idiotic experience I’ve had in quite some time. I have contacted CS because KLM has allowed me to book and pay for a flight they then showed canceled in the confirmation page. Was this designed to trick me into paying for something that isn’t available to then rebook me on an option nobody wants, perhaps. Or perhaps it was an issue of the internal system not correctly showing customers real-time information. In either case, it’s their fault and it felt irritating. The agent offered me a second option which I confirmed I wanted, proceeded to book me, and then two seconds later informed me that that flight too was canceled. Either a sick joke, I thought to myself, or complete incompetence. However, the agent then came up with a list of other options, all that were not ok for me because were arriving either too late in the night or they had me sitting 7+ hours in layover. At one point, however, they came up with an option that was more than impossible and then simply proceeded to book me and send me a confirmation without waiting for me to even reply. Why I say this option was impossible is because the connection flight was leaving at 10.40 while the first flight there leaving after that, at 14.40. You then understand how it’s impossible for me to bend physics and time and space continuum, to catch a flight that leaves hours after I’m supposed to catch my second. Total insanity. Upon insistent questioning I didn’t get even one apology, but a passive-aggressive message informing me to make up my mind quickly because all the available flights get booked quickly. The option the agent had next for me was a flight that seemed familiar, until I realized it was the exact flight they offered the second time - the flight that they booked and then informed me it was already canceled. So this person was offering to book me on a canceled flight, once more. This, my dear reader, is when I lost the will to live in this nightmare. I asked them if they were simply mocking me at this point. I begged for an answer once, twice, thrice, as they weren’t answering my messages at this point. After about 45 min the agent comes back, untroubled and provides me with another 2 options - one of which was again not possible due to limitations in the fabric of space and time. I gave up and agreed to one of the options that required me to spend 5 hours in layover, thinking it’s better than the rest of eternity in this purgatory. Now, you judge my experience and how many stars it deserves, but I for one cannot comprehend the level of absurdity I was forced to endure for about 7 hours while on your Customer Service messenger line.

551,Clare Barnaby-Smith,Indonesia,2021-04-09,1,"We booked two business class seats for travel on January 7th from DPS to SIN and return SIN to DPS on the 9th of January. Payment was by bank transfer and received 2 immediate confirmations; an email from Permata Bank confirming that the money was transferred successfully to KLM's bank account; the 2nd email was from KLM with booking confirmation (UKLFCP) complete with seat numbers (1A and 1C). We got to the airport (DPS) at 7pm for a 9.30pm departure, only to be told on check-in that our booking had 'not been paid for'. We showed the check-in staff our booking confirmation and the email + text from our bank confirming that the payment had been received by KLM. After being refused travel, we called the duty manager at DPS , who appeared to take great delight as he told us we 'didn't have a ticket'. We showed him our payment confirmation and booking confirmation, which mentions ticket conditions, etc. Yet he refused to allow us to check-in. We asked him to call KLM in Holland but instead he called Air France who could not help. By this point, we had been at the customer service desk for more than an hour and a half and were unable to reach a single KLM staff member other than the passive-aggressive station manager who told us that the only way we could travel on the flight was to buy two more economy tickets (business class was full). He told us to try and book the flight online on our phones which we tried to do, having absolutely no choice to not travel (my husband's Indonesian visa meant that he had to leave Bali on the 7th, or face a hefty fine. We also had an appointment at the Indonesian embassy to get our permanent residency for Indonesia). At the same time, our phone showed that KLM was still advertising business class seats on the same flight! We tried to book those but KLM's online payment facility failed. We asked the station manager if he would let us pay for those business class seats which were still being advertised online through the customer service desk (remember we had already paid for two business class return tickets). The station manager refused to let us do that and forced us to buy two economy return tickets, for 13,501,200 RP. Our original payment for the two return business class tickets on Dec 21st was 14,340,800 Rupiah (over $1000 USD). To add insult to injury, as we were leaving the desk, we asked for a pass to the lounge to grab a quick drink and perhaps a sandwich (we'd been at the desk now for almost 2 hours). The staff said, 'you are traveling in economy'. During this process, we sent several requests for help via the KLM WhatsApp number; sending them copies of our proof of payment and booking confirmation. They did not respond for almost 2 hours and when they did, they told us that the case had been 'resolved' at the check-in desk, which of course it had not. We purchased business class tickets on Garuda to travel back from SIN. We launched a complaint to KLM. On February 18th, KLM offered us €600 euros compensation each, but on February 19th, we received the following email from KLM customer services agent  'Regarding the Denied Boarding Compensation, the legislation does not apply for trips out of Europe (DPS-SIN).

552,Bruce Badash,United States,2021-04-03,1,"On January 24 we booked a trip on KLM from Bergen, Norway to Barcelona, Spain, for travel on September 2. We booked long ahead of our travel dates to get a good schedule at a good price. Our trip was KLM 1188, departing Bergen at 2:10pm and arriving in Amsterdam at 3:55pm, and KLM 1675, leaving at 4:45pm, and arriving in Barcelona at 6:50pm. We expected to have a nice, leisurely morning before heading to the airport. However, on March 30, we received two emails indicating that our flights had been changed. The first email stated that we were being changed from KLM 1675 to KLM 1681, leaving Amsterdam at 8:35pm and arriving in Barcelona at 10:45pm, making it impossible to make any connection to our final destination. Our layover in Amsterdam was changed from 50 minutes (a little short, but it's what we chose) to 4 hours and 40 minutes. Then, 90 minutes later, the second email stated that we had been changed from KLM 1188 to KLM 1186, leaving Bergen at 11:35am and arriving in Amsterdam at 1:20pm. Now we were not only arriving in Barcelona quite late, but our layover was changed to 7 hours and 15 minutes. This wasn't at all what we had booked, and was the first instance of poor customer support -- and we only chose KLM on Travelocity because it met our needs, not because of a specific desire to fly that airline. Unfortunately, due to other obligations, I studied KLM's flight choices on April 2, three days later, and tried to change my flights at that time. Travelocity assisted at this point, for quite a long time, but ran into problems with KLM. I stated that the first flight was acceptable, but that we'd prefer the second flight be changed to KLM 1673, departing Amsterdam at 2:15pm. This would change our layover in Amsterdam to 55 minutes, and restore the trip duration to something very similar to our original trip. Instead, KLM decided that our original flight was most comparable (in price or class) to a flight leaving at 6:05am! They would only change our tickets to KLM 1184 leaving Bergen at 6:05, and KLM 1669 leaving Amsterdam after a 2 1/2 hour layover. (And, they charged a few dollars per ticket, extra, for the privilege of this horrible start time, and longer trip.) I was informed after the fact, by Travelocity, that I should have contacted an airline within a day of being notified of unacceptable flight changes (and I'll do so in the future!), but this wasn't my highest priority in those few days. What's most irritating, however, is that not only did KLM somehow think that changing a trip duration from less than 5 hours to more than 11 hours was ""reasonable"", but that the final resolution of moving a flight from 2pm to 6am was all that was offered. I'd heard that KLM was a decent airline, and we'll find out for ourselves in September, but this customer experience makes it very unlikely that they'll get our business for any of our future travels.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bergen to Barcelona via Amsterdam,April 2021,,,,,,,2,no,False,Bergen,Barcelona,Amsterdam,Positive,0.5994,  january 24 book trip bergen norway barcelona spain travel september 2 book long ahead travel date get good schedule good price trip 1188 depart bergen arrive amsterdam 1675 leave arrive barcelona expect nice leisurely morning head airport however march 30 receive two email indicate flight change first email state change 1675 1681 leave amsterdam arrive barcelona make impossible make connection final destination layover amsterdam change 50 minute little short choose 4 hour 40 minute 90 minute later second email state change 1188 1186 leave bergen arrive amsterdam arrive barcelona quite late layover change 7 hour 15 minute book first instance poor customer support choose travelocity meet need specific desire fly unfortunately due obligation study choice april 2 three day later try change flight time travelocity assist point quite long time run problem state first acceptable prefer second change 1673 depart amsterdam change layover amsterdam 55 minute restore trip duration something similar original trip instead decide original comparable price class leave change ticket 1184 leave bergen 1669 leave amsterdam 2 hour layover charge dollar per ticket extra privilege horrible start time longer trip inform fact travelocity contact within day notify unacceptable change future high priority day irritate however somehow think change trip duration less 5 hour 11 hour reasonable final resolution move 2pm 6am offer heard decent find september customer experience make unlikely get business future travel

Decided to try their long-haul flight and it turned out different from my last experience, although on this flight there was 1 person out of many who's still have that attitude. It make me wonder if there is difference between city hopper and world business cabin crew's quality or is it just service inconsistency? Somehow I did not expect much based on previous flight experience with them. One item on the menu was not enough to cater its business class passengers, therefore I had to choose another option. Perhaps because of the ticket booked on the same day of departure. Unlike any other airlines I have flown on, the food on this flight were served in little tiny portion but tasty.

555,V Keller,Switzerland,2021-03-14,3,"I flew with KLM from Mexico City to Zurich via Amsterdam. I will go over my thoughts about the experience point by point: (1) Both the Mexico City and KLM have a mask requirement, so obviously I was wearing one, and also I had additional masks in my hand luggage. However, KLM's ground staff in Mexico City asked me if I had a mask (ignoring that I was very obviously wearing one), and when I asked to clarify, they incorrectly claimed that KLM requires FFP2 medical masks to be worn. While I did have such a mask with me, KLM does not actually have such a requirement (see https://www.klm.nl/en/information/faq/airport-on-board). In challenging times such as the COVID pandemic, it is more important than ever to know the rules and to be respectful to customers, which KLM didn't do. (2) The aircraft interior on both flight legs (Mexico City to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to Zurich) looked tired and old. The flight attendants did not seem happy about doing their job. (3) KLM Crown Lounge 25 in the Amsterdam airport had a sign that it was closed at 2 pm. My flight arrived at 3 pm and I had a connection time of almost 6 hours. (By the way, the airside hotel YOTELAIR did not have any short term stays available, and Aspire Lounge 26 only allows access three hours before a flight.) As a result, I had to walk around the airport and sit in crowded areas, which is not good in terms of social distancing. (4) On the flight leg from Amsterdam to Zurich, I was given a hand sanitizing gel only quite a while after the meal and the drink, making it useless. Overall, considering Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is also not as attractive as it used to be, I will avoid flying with KLM in the future.",Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Mexico City to Zurich via Amsterdam,March 2021,3.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,,2,no,True,Mexico City,Zurich,Amsterdam,Positive,0.8555,  flew mexico city zurich via amsterdam go thought experience point point 1 mexico city mask requirement obviously wear one additional mask hand luggage however ground staff mexico city ask mask ignore obviously wear one ask clarify incorrectly claim require ffp2 medical mask worn mask actually requirement see http challenge time covid pandemic important ever know rule respectful customer 2 interior leg mexico city amsterdam amsterdam zurich look tired old attendant seem happy job 3 crown lounge 25 amsterdam airport sign close 2 pm arrive 3 pm connection time almost 6 hour way airside hotel yotelair short term stay available aspire lounge 26 allows access three hour result walk around airport sit crowd area good term social distance 4 leg amsterdam zurich give hand sanitize gel quite meal drink make useless overall consider amsterdam airport schiphol attractive use avoid fly future

557,Khodadad Rezakhani,United States,2021-03-04,3,"There are so many things to day about KLM, the oldest passenger airline in the world. It has kept the same quality for many years, and it is a great representation of Dutch efficiency and thrift. So many reasons to fly them, so many reasons not to as well! But today, I want to rant about one thing: the KLM “entertainment” system. It is indeed entertaining to see a major airline with this ridiculous selection of TV and film choices. Imagine you have flown any airline at all (ok, not Ryanair, but you know what I am talking about!): you probably get a system with at least 5-10 comedy, and as much Drama and Lifestyle and Docu options, usually a full season. Then you get at least 5-7 full “box sets” (entire TV shows). I have never seen less. For films, by my count the average is 50-70 films, with about 5-10 new films, and staples like Harry Potter or ET and things of the sort. Now, we have KLM’s entertaining system: Two episodes of of TV comedies. I kid you not. Two single episodes! Three episodes of Drama shows. Three full seasons (season 2 of the Handmaid’s Tale!). Four episodes of “lifestyle” Five episodes of “docu” (incl two KLM promotionals!) Films: 30 films total, including “children’s programme” featuring a ridiculous KLM aircraft, Docus, promotionals, etc, the highlight of which is Benjamin Button!

570,J Meares,Ireland,2020-10-26,1,"Due to a change in schedule in my MIA-ATL-AMS flights last June, I was informed by Delta that I would have a long layover in Atlanta if I went on my original booking, leaving me in Atlanta for over 8 hours while waiting on the interconnecting flight to Amsterdam. As i knew the lounges were probably closed and I didn't want to subject myself to a COVID-19 potential in a large airport for an entire day, I was obviously not at all pleased with this change. As I had bought the ticket from Air France, I called them directly and after explaining my distinct unhappiness with this change, which was a fault of the scheduling change, and not from my side, was offered another option of going with KLM instead of Delta and this would reduce my layover in Atlanta to 4 hours, so I decided to change to this option, especially since the business class flight being offered ha the same seating configuration as my original booking, which was in a configuration of 1x2x1. I specifically asked for confirmation of this and it was confirmed by the AF agent and they put me in the same seat number of 4A and I had double checked again when checking in was still accurate. When I boarded the plane in Atlanta, I was shocked and dismayed to see that the configuration of the plane was 2 - 3 - 2 instead and there was never any notification about this. They had still kept my boarding card at 4A but now there was a 4B next to me and what's worse, the entire business class section was packed with passengers, offering no social distancing whatsoever, and the person next to me had brought in a greasy back of food from one of the fast food restaurants and I had that smell with me the entire journey from Atlanta to Amsterdam, and in my clothes the remainder of the following day. Also there was no real food service, only a terrible pasta dish (economy fare) and soggy sandwich dropped on my seat later on, only served water and flight attendants literally disappeared. Upon returning home, as a Platinum member of Flying Blue, I complained a number of occasions to KLM and, each time they finally decided to respond after weeks of waiting, they persisted to blame COVID-19 for everything! They gave no excuse why COVID-19 caused an aircraft change and them not dutifully informing me, why it was so full with no social distancing possible, why no drink service apart from water was offered, and why flight attendants disappeared. I got nowhere with them and gave up finally vowing never to darken the door again with them. I had traveled to the US with Delta Airlines from Amsterdam, and they were 100X better, and they have implemented a block middle seat policy in all classes of travel to assure social distancing.

I realize that during this current climate of additional rules and regulations, staff may not be able to keep up with all the constant changes and will need to verify whether or not they do actually have a good understanding of Covid protocols and procedures for different countries but this needs to happen before inflicting their incorrect knowledge on the customer. I arrived to check in my bags for a long 2 stop trip to Colombia and the staff member promptly informed me that tourists weren’t being allowed in and that I would not be able to travel. Having not had any sleep and checking in at 4 in the morning, I was not quite ready for this and was wondering how I had got my information so wrong. I queried it and she called someone who evidently told her she was right. I told her that this was not true and that tourist flights had begun at the beginning of October. She said I was wrong and showed me an ambiguous statement on the KLM site and then said she didn’t have time to deal with disagreements and had other people to check in. I asked for a number so that I could call KLM about it so she gave me an emergency number and shooed me away. I then realized the emergency call number only took calls after 8am. My flight was at 6am. I decided to look up government websites to show her that tourists were being admitted. I found the proof and went back to the desk. After some more telephone calls she then came off the phone to tell me that in actual fact I was right and that I could fly. I was just shocked at how easily she could say no and then say yes without even a lame apology. Very poor customer service.

578,D Jarsun,Poland,2020-09-13,1,"I was going back from my 2 weeks stay in Mexico with the connection (Mexico) SLP-MEX-AMS-KRK (Poland) A day before the trip (10/09/2020) I received information from KLM confirming that I will travel next day and can check in - so just confirming that everything is fine. At SLP airport I received a ticket to MEX and was told that for next part of my trip I should go to the KLM Check-In Desk to collect remaining tickets. My baggage at SLP was sent directly to KRK. At MEX airport I went to the KLM check-in desk. During check-in it appeared that there is some problems with my tickets - I was waiting about 1 hour to get some explanation and the person was contacting with many other people next to him and calling by phone many others. After that I received information that my reservation is OK but my tickets are not OK due to some mistakes in the system done by my travel agent who was selling ticket to me - I could not understand such explanation - how can happen that reservation is OK but tickets are NOK. And was told that if I want to travel I need to contact my travel agency to clarify or buy new tickets. It was during the night and I was during my trip with total duration about 24h. Finally I manage to contact my travel agency and to due to emergency situation the new ticket was issued - but the whole process took probably more than 2 hours. I received some explanation from KLM with the screen shot of their system - and they were telling me that in one column there is a letter ""E"" in their system but it should be something else. But the same letter ""E"" was with the flight I had just before from SLP-MEX done by Aeromexico operator. I asked why it was possible to fly with Aeromexico with identical status and it's not possible with KLM - they told me - yes because it was domestic carrier but with KLM you can not. I do not know who created the problem: KLM or my travel agency - but from my point of view full responsibility is on KLM side.  Why did they confirm a day before that everything is fine - do they know what they have in their electronic systems ? - looks like that they do not know. Why the same ticket status was OK for Aeromexico and NOK for KLM.

KLM were phenomenal. Getting through to speak to someone was surprisingly quick every time. I had a pet in cabin as a special request on my booking, so had to call each time I needed to make changes. This could have been super frustrating, but it wasn't at all. Their reps were always super kind and friendly, very helpful - every time just went out of their way to help me. I had to change my ticket 5 different times. Each was quick and easy to do. My dad also had a booking with them that did not fall under the cancellation / rescheduling rules linked with COVID, but they still went above and beyond to offer him a travel voucher, which he wasn't really entitled to. Using their app is easy. Their prices are good. Service on the plane was good too.

609,D Clarkson,United Kingdom,2020-03-29,1,"Booked to return from Malaysia to Amsterdam on 31/03/2020. Flight cancelled by KLM one week prior to departure, the reason being Coronavirus. No options given except refund voucher to the value of the flight. I appreciate the problem the airlines are currently having, however: 1. KLM had a daily service to Malaysia. However, they reduced this by half in the two weeks before my flight was due to depart. Last KLM flight from Malaysia was on 28/03/2020 although both Kuala Lumpur and Amsterdam airport remained open thereafter. 2. I repeatedly tried to reschedule (bring forward) on the KLM website, but it would not allow. I did have a very basic economy ticket, but the website advised that all change costs were being waived by KLM in the current circumstances. But still not allowed to change. 3. If KLM had allowed me to reschedule and if they had kept their daily service up to 28/03/2020, I and numerous other KLM customers could have safely travelled with KLM. 4. I am of the opinion that the reasons behind the cancellation were purely financial; KLM calculated it was cheaper to cancel the tickets outstanding rather than send aircraft to Malaysia to pick up the passengers (many of whom would have very cheap tickets). A very cynical attitude from a major aviation operator when people are understandably anxious in the circumstances.

637,M Vamarez,Finland,2020-01-20,3,"Rio de Janeiro to Helsinki via Amsterdam. I have flown to Argentina with KLM before, and I have never had to pay extra for checked luggage before. Especially considering KLM is not a low-cost carrier, I would have never expected to pay extra for checked luggage on an international flight with KLM (or with any other carrier for that matter). When I performed the reservation process, at no time did I see a clear and visible placard stating that baggage was not included in the fare. This should have, in the first place, been clearly stated when I was searching for the price of tickets through KLM. I found out that my luggage had to be paid for at Helsinki airport when I went to drop it off. Furthermore, the fact that checked luggage was not included was also not clear during the on-line check-in process (because I could have corrected it there and paid for it). This is misleading and shows poor business practices on the part of KLM, tricking their customers into viewing low fares that so not include something as basic as checked luggage. Furthermore, they charge so much for the checked luggage at the airport (€60 at Helsinki, and €76 at Cordoba), that the fare ends up being more expensive than competitors. This is quite simply a scam. Also, when I tried to check-in online, I was unable to, because neither KLM, nor the other carrier GOL would allow online check-in. This meant that I was forced to pay even more for the checked luggage at Cordoba airport because I was unable to pay for it on-line (which would have costed less).

651,M Ward,Australia,2019-12-03,9,"Whilst this review covers my trip from Abu Dhabi to Rome via Amsterdam, my comments mainly relate to the Abu Dhabi to Amsterdam flight. On the long leg of our trip, we chose to pay extra for Economy Comfort class seats, which provides more leg room and greater recline. You might only get a couple of inches extra leg room, but it is surprising the difference this can make. Other than the extra leg room/greater seat recline, the service on board is the same as standard economy. The meals on the flight were very good as too was the overall cabin service. In flight entertainment was also good, with enough content to keep you entertained. In summary, our flight to Amsterdam, in Economy Comfort Class, was very good and I managed to get some sleep. Overall, I think it was well worth the extra cost. For our flight from Amsterdam to Rome, there is little to report, given that it is considered a short, domestic flight in Europe. The service was good. No in flight entertainment. A snack was served on the flight. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient. The only minor complaint was the amount of carry on luggage some passengers were allowed to carry on, meaning that most of the overhead lockers were quickly filled and some of our stuff had to placed on the floor. This wasn't a great inconvenience though, but if you had more bulky items, it could have been. This is the first time I have travelled with KLM and I was pleasantly surprised.

I liked the airline for three reasons, they have nice staff, often very good deals, and it's relaxing in their planes, at least I thought so. On this trip, staff was super-friendly, charming, and pleasant That certainly is a big plus. Food and entertainment were ok, but nothing to speak of. What’s really annoying/disturbing/painful are the seats in their Boeing's. They are terrible to sit and rest in, of lowest possible quality (tray table, for instance, would not fit back in front seat) and super uncomfortable.

696,Norman Brown,United Kingdom,2019-09-11,3,"KLM having changed their website earlier this year have made it very difficult for passengers to clearly understand the Terms and Conditions. Having travelled with KLM for over 15 years primarily to Cape Town and Europe have always understood that the cost of the ticket includes one checked in bag per person (23kilos) and hand baggage. My wife and I have just fallen foul of their atrocious web site after all of these years of loyal travel with them. Having travelled down to Cape Town we had to pay for a check in bag on the return flight at a cost of £60.00 in addition to the ticket. As I am a Flying Silver member I am entitled to an extra checked in bag which they refused and insisted that my wife had to pay for her bag. It transpires that many customers are falling foul of this new rule. So, anyone travelling with KLM beware. This is an unscrupulous and devious behaviour. I have spent all day complaining in writing and they now say one of the bags was one kilo over weight. But say nothing of the bag which was only 16kilos. This was never brought to our attention at check in. My combined check is 46 kilos. KLM have also reduces the on board staff making the inflight service very very slow. They have ceased the welcome on board drinks service, very welcome on a long haul flight. Reduced the standard of the food. Introduced a cost for selecting a preferred seat (standard seat) which used to be free for passengers booking ten months in advance which considering KLM have banked the money is a small reward for passengers booking early, The food quality has diminished considerably. This was not a good end to an enjoyable break. We used to sing the praises of KLM. But no longer.

KLM has done wrong by us on all parts below: On the flight April 10th 2019 from Amsterdam to Sweden my wife didn’t get any notice about that her flight was canceled until after the flight time. Then she got a new flight the day after but no stay at a hotel over the night which mainly is KLM policy. The day after on flight to Sweden her bag got stuck in transfer in Amsterdam. We called KLM about this and they said that we are entitled to 100 euros for every day the bag still was missing and that we would get back the money if we attach the receipts. One day later the bag came to us totally broken. We took pictures of the bag and sent it to KLM and asked for a refund our bag several times. The answer we got was: ""I note that you incurred additional expenses due to delay baggage. We will be pleased to reimburse the direct expenses. Additionally, in regards to your damage baggage, we would be grateful if you could send us the following supporting documents: The receipt for the cost of repair to your baggage or a written confirmation from any nearest stockiest with the following specifications: 1. The age and the current value of the damaged baggage 2. The type of damage inflicted to the bag 3. A confirmation that the suitcase cannot be satisfactorily repaired 4. The original purchase receipt for the damaged case"" Then they sent us to the same website we got this answer from. We don't have the purchase receipt and we shouldn't need it, because we didn't break it. They broke it and they should pay with the amount for a similar bag, around 100 euros. When we bought a new flight in June 2019 the website didn't work. On the website they offer a Premium package where you can change your flight without the extra fine on 150 euros and only pay for the difference in flight price. It also included the benefits of choosing the seats. I had to call to book the same flight as I tried to book on the website but on the phone they said the option to skip the fine wasn't available. I later had to change the flight and also had to pay the fine. When I tried to book the flight through the website there was an error but the money was reserved from my card. And I had to wait two business days and because of that, the ticket price raised with 200 euros.

To some guests they given 2 bottles of wine per person and 2 pieces of cake they prepared for the flight, for others one bottle and one cake. when we asked about the possibility to order 2 bottles what was the answer? “Excuse me, but we have limited quantity, so we can give only one per person.” Why someone of guests located close to us without any Golden Flying blue cards and so on, have more advantages than others? And also I cannot mention the behavior of cabin crew. It was not professional to treat all guests different and also I am not sure about their English knowledges.

703,Dixon Block,Germany,2019-09-03,3,"Toronto to Amsterdam. I have flown KLM about three times (return) in the past years since moving to Germany. Each time something goes wrong. I've had delays twice between 3-5 hours, I've been told different things by the customer service on the phone that suddenly are told different by the staff in person on the day (once I was forced to wait 13 hours in Amsterdam because of this) and just this past week I fell for their unclear advertising and was again mislead by conflicting statements by the customer service. As I checked in online for my flight, I was offered an upgrade to business class for only 89€, almost too good to be true, but as it was only a few hours before the flight, I assumed they were hoping to get rid of the seats. Just having gotten engaged and bought a house, my fiancee and I decided to spend the €178 to celebrate and get some sleep over the ocean. After we paid, however, we got business class only for the connecting 45 minute flight from Paris to Amsterdam! Not at all what originally was offered for 89€ each. We called the service number and were told it happens often, and we would get our money back when we talk to the service desk in Paris. So we flew economy over the ocean but in randomly assigned middle seats (at the back where the veggie meals had run out) and got no sleep. In Paris, they told us that the customer service was wrong and they would not give us our money back. We decided our luck was bad and we would enjoy the business class anyway, but on this small plane, the business class had seats identical to the economy, just without someone beside you.

Then, as people started boarding, it was chaos, as people went through boarding they were then stopped  to see if they had been tagged. This slowed everyone down even further. I decided to wait to the very end to board given I had paid extra for a seat up front (6F) and didn't want to be caught in the crush. When I did board, there was a still a queue of people waiting to board the plane. Why, because of the crazy boarding operation. When I finally boarded he plane, the captain made an announcement that passengers needed to hurry up so the plane would not miss its departure slot or we would be delayed up to 30 minutes. By the time I reached my seat, I sat down quickly. I watched passengers with children negotiating with others to swap seats so their families wouldn't be split up. And then, a father approached me to ask me to move so he could sit with his two children.  I was frustrated having paid more for my seat, having been organised months in advance, and waited until last to board the plane to avoid any issues. I was angry by his demanding nature. I said no. Then he carried on to flight attendants and created a scene. So, feeling sorry for him, I stood up, and said where do you want me to sit then. It was seat 23E. This was in between two passengers, which I hate. I had a window seat. Then when I made my way down the back, I saw an empty window seat and asked the FA if I could sit there. She was angry with me because she didn't know what was going on or why I was moving. And she said she wasn't sure if all the passengers had boarded. Fed up, I said ""You know what, I am evicted from my seat by a demanding father, I paid extra for that seat six months in advance, and now maybe I should just stand all the way to Amsterdam."" Suddenly, she said to have the window seat. I shouted this for all the plane to hear. After take off, the purser apologised profusely. I told her exactly what I thought of KLM's boarding procedure. I also told her that parents should not be demanding others move. It is up the staff at check-in to sort this out or the boarding staff or FA, not other passengers. She agreed and told me she had told him to wait until we took off given we were about to leave and his last minute arrival on the place. But he was as usual, feeling entitled. She offered me a seat in business class to compensate and went out of her way to ensure I was okay. She was lovely and very embarrassed for me.

After that they overrule themselves by saying compensation is 400 EUR. We sent them KLM all personal, flights and bank details. We never received any compensation from them or at least any excuse for this catastrophe. Avoid this airline in all circumstances.

Everyone has their plan of dealing with time zones and jet lag etc. Mine is to have the meal, watch a movie, a decent length sleep and wake 2 hours before landing for breakfast. It is a plan that has served me well. I had a glass of wine with the early nibbles and when the stewardess came with the starter she asked if I wanted anything else to drink as if most people would be happy with 1 glass of wine in a 10.5 hour trip. Mind, apart from bringing the food, we didn’t see much of her apart from a quick walk through very occasionally but eyes upwards so no-one could ask her to do anything. After the meal I sat quietly finishing off the film with some wine. 45 minutes before sleep time I asked for a glass of wine to help me get off to sleep at a strange time. I was just sitting quietly watching a film. The purser came with the glass of wine and said, and this is in business class, “this is not a free bar and I have been told you have had enough wine and you won’t get any more”. You can’t begin to guess my astonishment, treating me like a drunkard when I am one of the best, most polite people you could ever meet. Insulting and humiliating doesn’t really begin to describe it.

719,Graeme Bray,Australia,2019-07-23,3,"Dublin to Sandefjord via Amsterdam. First leg of the flight, DUB-AMS, was operated a plane from Stobart Air, with a KLM crew. Upon check-in, I was informed of a 25 minute delay but that I should be able to make my booked connections. However, at the gate, the delay just kept getting longer and longer. As I was standing around, I received an email informing me that my flight would not make the original connection to CPH and that I had automatically been re-booked onto another flight, however this meant I would miss my rail connection to Sweden. The gate staff were not able to do much, as they were only local Irish contractors and not KLM staff. The delay was progressively made later and later. The flight was almost 2 hours late and was causing great stress and worry for me about being stranded in CPH. Only suggestion was to see the transfer desk in Amsterdam, who were helpful and professional. I asked if I could be rebooked onto Oslo, but initially they said it was booked out. They had only been looking at OSL and did not even consider TRF, until I suggested it. It was a very late flight option but it was better than everything else presented to me. The delayed DUB-AMS Stobart Air flight was best described as adequate. It was quite obvious that the air crew were thrown together and were disjointed in their operations. However they were very professional in their appearance and interactions with the passengers. The AMS-TRF flight was a proper KLM flight, on the same plane type.

The amount of movies and shows available on the IFE is one of the best I’ve seen. While the range of shows is great, most only do have 1 episode. The huge selection and modern IFE is, unfortunately, undermined by the horrible audio quality.

Instead I was flying to Brussels, then on to Amsterdam and arriving 6 hours after my scheduled meeting. After 2 hours of pleading, they still couldn't care less. Basically spoke to a human robot for 2 hours. Ended up getting 2 hours sleep, going to Aberdeen first then Amsterdam, and still missed my meeting due to a delay and then having to wait 40 mins for my bag which was hand luggage that they insisted on putting in the hold. All they have to say is they were within their rights to do so. Ignoring the lack of morals involved and stress it caused me. I wasn't interested in their measly offer of compensation, I just wanted my original flight. To do this to people - which I believe they do regularly - at such short notice is immoral and wrong. Sent a complaint afterwards and today - 8 days later - no response. When I rang for an update, I got another of their human robots who just repeated they were within their rights to do it. The stress this caused me at the time, as well as forcing me to take a different flight which left me with virtually no sleep, is not patched up by some lowball monetary offer.

About midway through a flight, the only round of drinks (water only) and icecream was served. Another meal service was initiated about 90 minutes to landing which was ok (sort of Pizza slice) and some dessert and salad. Enjoyable.

One point that deserves KLM attention is their long haul product is the seat, while on short haul it offers a good seat pitch and recline, their long haul product needs an update urgently. The seat is too narrow limiting the choice of a good sleeping position even though it stretches to a full horizontal position, space for the feet is minimal and if you need to go to the toilet, you will have to jump over your neighbours legs, most airlines are now offering seats in a staggering position to avoid this.

Shortly before boarding they announce there is a technical problem. About 45 minutes later I call KLM for advice whether to rebook immediately for fear of missing the connection in Amsterdam. Person on the other end is of no help and barely understands my question. About 90 minutes after we were supposed to board, flight is cancelled and we are advised to go to counters for rebooking. While waiting in line I discover an e-mail from KLM saying they've rebooked us to an evening flight, which means delay in arrival of about 12 hours, midnight instead of noon. At the counter we are informed there are no available earlier flights and we get zero information about EU directive for compensation in case of delay, just a useless peace of paper saying they're sorry and how I can contact customer service on Twitter. We get vouchers for 10 EUR of airport food and that's it. On the evening flight there are problems as the airport system says the flight is closed and we cannot go to security, takes about 20 minutes to clear that up. Flight to Amsterdam goes smoothly and we arrive practically on the gate for the connection. Flight Amsterdam to Oslo is delayed about 15 minutes. On the way back, Oslo-Amsterdam goes well. Amsterdam to Luxembourg, they put us in the plane and announce there is a delay due to strike of Belgian air control, will take about 20 minutes, ends up taking 35, and then they discover a technical problem and call maintenance. Another good 20 minutes until they reset something, and we are good to go. Which means another 10-15 minutes plus long taxi.

770,T Henry,United Kingdom,2019-05-08,9,"My partner and I were travelling from Rome to Edinburgh via Amsterdam on 7/5/2019. Unfortunately, the flight from Rome was delayed due to factors outside of KLM's control, and we missed our connection. The KLM team were very professional and helpful. They apologised to us in person on the flight and advised us that we would be put up in a hotel overnight and rebooked onto a flight the next morning (there were no flights to Schiphol that night after our missed connection). The staff on the flight gave us instructions on how to use the appropriate self service terminals within Schiphol to obtain our vouchers for accommodation, transport and food overnight. Through the terminal at Schiphol, we were easily able to check in for our flight the next morning (already rebooked for us), select our seats, and print vouchers for a hotel stay, airport food and a shuttle bus to and from the hotel. The vouchers for food worked at the terminal and transport to the Ibis hotel was efficient and straightforward. On arrival at the hotel, there was a special check in desk for delayed KLM customers and we were served promptly and professionally, with a timetable provided for the shuttle bus the next day. Our room was pleasant and transport to the airport the next day was once again straightforward. The hotel stay even included dinner and breakfast, though we did not partake.

771,Dan Grew,Netherlands,2019-05-08,7,"I am a fairly regular and satisfied user of KLM in Business Class, albeit normally long haul. On this occasion it was a relatively short flight from Amsterdam to Malaga with my family. Check in was speedy but no notification was given that there was an aircraft type and configuration change (already known at check-in by the way). Consequently it came as a surprise when we boarded to find that some of us had been re-assigned. One could argue that we should have checked our seat assignments at check in. My excuse is that I have never experienced an unannounced seat re-allocation in all the 20 years or so I have travelled with KLM. Advance warning of the fact would have been welcomed. Lounge was adequate. Boarding procedure reasonably adequate. Comfort factor in Business Class was no more than one can expect on European flights these days! Cabin crew friendly but lacked concentration. In a cabin of 11 passengers the Purser somehow managed to forget to serve both my wife's and my meal. These things can happen, although one can question why in such a small cabin. If we were not regulars on KLM it could have left a very poor impression of the airline to a newcomer.

774,Marco van Zoest,Netherlands,2019-04-30,1,"I flew to Venice to enjoy a week of paragliding with some friends. When I booked the ticket, I had to pay extra for checked baggage (standard for most airlines) but KLM decided not to load the baggage onto the aircraft. This looks like a new little trick to make extra cash. Overbooking the bagage and then send it via the next flight. While we were waiting to board the aircraft, I actually saw my luggage being handled by bagage handlers, it was at the aircraft. KLM did not load my baggage, it was not by error or mistake, but by decision. Obviously I was very surprised that my baggage were ""delayed"". It took me 2 hours at the the lost baggage counter to complete the lost baggage claim form. I was traveling with two other persons, so they also had to wait. I'm not going to go into detail, but you can imagine the repercussion of this. The next day was Easter Sunday, not a single shop was open. I went to Italy to paraglide, but that's not an option if you don't have your paraglider. So in an instant my holiday was ruined. A financial loss that does not get covered by the airline or insurance. The complete lack of empathy of the customer service is amazing. Unwilling to do anything other than telling me I have to wait. Lying to me that the bagage will be delivered within 24 hours while they were fully aware it was a public holiday and nothing will be done. I offered to fetch the baggage myself at the airport, but that was too much trouble for the customer service employee to get that organised. So she just lied to me and said that it was not possible and the baggage is probably already on its way. It arrived 2 days later. I decided to file a complaint, hopeful that I could get a reason why my bagage was not loaded onto the aircraft. This is the most disgusting service I ever experienced. Basically they copy paste text from your complaint and add ""We are sorry for"" or even better ""I am concerned to read about"" in front of it. I had to ask the person to reread my complaint as their response made no sense. They offered me a 100 euro voucher which I turned down, what an insult. I don't measure how well a business runs, I measure them how they resolve a problem.

On the flight home the airline overbooked and were trying to get people to get on another flight, they also started saying they wanted to check in carry on luggage and one man working for KLM lied and said that we were all only suppose to have one carry on and not another small bag- just an item like a purse or an umbrella, not a backpack, I looked this up immediately after and could see clearly on the website that it stated we were allowed a carry on luggage bag to go in the top and another small bag (40cm etc) that can fit under the seat in front of you which means he definitely only said it because they over booked and wanted peoples hand luggage checked in which was a bit sly.

785,H Kim,South Korea,2019-04-16,1,"Beijing to Newcastle via Amsterdam. The actual flight was ok. Nothing special. But the worst part of this whole ordeal was the way they handled things behind the scenes. On my way to Newcastle they lost my bag. Ok no problem. Mistakes can happen. I get my claim reference number and then get a text the next day that my bag will be arriving. I go check for the bag they said they left at reception and it is the wrong bag. In my description of the bag I said that it is a hard shell gray suitcase. The bag that showed up was a soft black bag. I call KLM letting them know that the wrong bag showed up and they tell me that I have to bring the bag back to the airport. I tell them no because it was their mistake and why should I go out of my way on my 13 day vacation to fix their mistake. They apologized and said they would send someone over to pick it up. In my 13 days in Newcastle I probably called them over 27 times. Each time being told that they are still looking for the bag. I come back home after my trip to Korea and keep calling. Finally one component employee let's me know that they have actually put the search for my bag on hold because I hadn't returned the wrong bag. Mind you, this is over 2 months now and no one has ever mentioned this to me in my previous calls after the first call I gave them when they delivered the wrong bag. I told them that I have told a KLM representative to pick up the bag and they said that they would. They apologized and sent someone over and then a few days later my bag arrived. I have never been so stressed about travelling until this. I wasn't unhappy about them losing my bag, but was extremely frustrated with the KLM handled the whole situation. Each time I called, it seemed that the employee was more confused about my situation. My phone calls consisted of me asking them to open my case for the search which they said they would request their supervisor, but my case was only opened 2 months later. Each employee guaranteed the case would be opened, but it was all a lie. Communication is not a quality the company has within their team.

787,E Mandalesh,Canada,2019-04-09,2,"Amsterdam to Montreal. I had a bad experience during my last trip. I was supposed to initially board on an AtlasGlobal plane from Istanbul to Amsterdam, and then after 2 hours of layover get on the KLM plane towards Montreal.

Therefore, when we got to Amsterdam Schiphol airport we had only 20 minutes to pass security and run for the KLM flight. So had to run from 1 end of airport to the other (including running down the stairs). The plane was already boarded and we barely made it.

After going through a lot of forms and extra wait and stress we were able to file a delivery request for our baggage as we live in Ottawa which is 2 hours driving distance from Montreal The next day, after a long unhappy flight experience, we got another notification mentioning that our baggage is still on its way, and we should go to KL baggage service desk at ""the airport"".

Decided to upgrade during online check-in for a reasonable amount of Flying Blue miles because there were a lot of open seats left. Check-in at the airport went smooth and security check was a breeze. Decided to spend some time in the Delta SkyClub lounge but wasn't really impressed by the breakfast they had on offer. Some fruits and bread rolls but nothing fancy. The seating options and the views over the tarmac were fine though. Boarding started on time and immediately after taking my seat the purser introduced herself and offered me a welcome drink. The crew on this flight was great and everything was done with a personal touch. One hour after takeoff lunch was served and the meal was great. After lunch I was able to get a couple of hours sleep in the lie-flat-seat. Think it was pretty comfortable. A second meal could be ordered any time you liked. I decided to try the guilty pleasure burger which tasted good but unfortunately the meat was still cold. After notifying the crew it went back to the oven again and after a few minutes the burger was hot and perfectly cooked.

The first occasion consisted of 2 KLM connections and one IcelandAir. During this process, my checked in luggage was misplaced for two whole weeks. When it finally arrived after I travelled to Sweden, I checked the baggage tags and realised it never made it to Iceland at all (meaning one of the first two flights messed up: both KLM. They put the onus completely on IcelandAir (which is fine) and made no customer service attempt to help the customer (not fine). Now, today: we awoke for an international flight 4 hours before it departed, and found an email notifying is that our flight had been cancelled and that we'd been put on an 'earlier flight'. The flight's checkin closed the same time we woke up. Rude awakening to say the least. Our travel agent couldn't help because KLM had confirmed the tickets without getting our input, nor even attempting to contact us directly. Mind you, our notification came in at 12.30am (from our travel agent), and when we arrived at the airport, the ticket staff grilled us asking us 'why we were checking in so late.'

When I booked the flight it was nowhere mentioned that we would stop in Kuala Lumpur, as happened when I booked the flight from Amsterdam to Denpasar, that included a stopover in Singapore. That is not honest for such a “serious” airline. Therefore, in both flights we “lost“ around one hour and a half because of those stopovers. Besides, KLM’s system seems to be that of a third class airline since I was never able to change seats even though the system was inviting and “allowing” me to do it. Food in the Jakarta- Kuala Lumpur leg was indeed awful and in the rest of the trip was just bearable. After boarding the plane for the leg Amsterdam - Atlanta we observed something that was “strange”: the cabin crew in the back part of the plane did not show any interest in helping passengers solve their seat and hand luggage problems. The two crew ladies were very happy chatting aloud between themselves and showed no concern for the passengers. Poor service! We had’nt flown with KLM since a long time ago.

824,J Gillams,Netherlands,2019-01-06,1,We had a flight from Oslo to Amsterdam. Because of fog at Schiphol airport the flight was cancelled. I had to take another fight from Brussels the day after and my friend had important meetings the day after. We called the call center in Amsterdam but it was too busy. We could not speak to a call center agent. We decided to immediately book a new KLM ticket for the same day but earlier. This flight was not cancelled. The tickets were 355 EUR for a very short flight. We expected KLM to refund the tickets as the call center was too busy and because of the force majeure situation. In the plane we met people that took the same flight as us but initially booked the later flight like us. They went to the airport and KLM (in fact SAS) staff booked them to the earlier flight FREE OF CHARGE. We called several times with the call center the day after but they didn't want to refund the 710 EUR. They said we had chosen ourselves to make extra costs. But for the airline (apart from credit card charges) it wasn't an extra cost at all. There were enough empty seats and we didn't take the flight the day after KLM booked us on later in the evening. They said we could try to get money back from travel insurance. They offered 2 vouchers as leniency but this was by far not the 710 EUR we had to pay for a very short European flight. Apart from the issue described my plane chair was broken and could not stand completely straight. It was a very old aircraft and they did not invest in a new chair which is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE and UNSAFE. So for a price of 355 EUR I had to sit in a broken chair.

The lady behind the counter told me no, without additional expressions such as ""unfortunately"" or ""I am sorry but..."". She then threatened to rebook my flight. When I told her that I had already been delayed and that it would not be possible for me to catch a later flight she replied with ""that is not my problem"". When I told her that I would try to repack my bag, according to her own instructions, she once again threatened to rebook my flight, despite me having told her no once already.

My flight was originally meant to leave at about 8:25 pm today but because they overbooked people on this flight they downgraded me to economy class without my knowledge. I complained to the agent about my seat not being what I booked and paid for. They made me leave that airplane to sort out the issue all by myself. I spoke to one of the KLM agents and showed her my itinerary at the airport gate - who told me they were overbooked while another agent rebooked me on a business seat on another flight leaving tonight at 10:30pm after so much confusion and frustration. I called the customer service number and the Lady was nice but on getting to the lady supervisor on the phone with a three way call, she was rude, insensitive, inhumane to my plight for help after I and my wife explained the situation to her. All she kept saying was my flight was not confirmed and she can not help me even after the gate KLM agent told me it was due to overbooked flight. She went on to say the flight the KLM airport agent gave me would not work because she can not see it on the computer and she refused to talk to the airport agent at any time to resolve the issue after explaining to her the need to...so they could discuss their findings on their individual klm computers. My question to KLM corporate is why do some KLM clients have to go through so much stress and why did they choose me to be downgraded, inconvenienced and embarrassed? I would have appreciated if someone explained to me honestly what was going on instead of some KLM staff especially the supervisor being so so so nonchalant about the situation. However, I would like to commend the last KLM customer service rep my wife spoke to tonight on the phone. He was empathetic and understanding.

Drinks were regularly and proactively offered, and the food was excellent; one dish in particular is the best meal I've ever eaten on a plane, and was presented in such a way that you'd be impressed even in a restaurant. The IFE was great - a strong selection of new and old movies, and the screens were large and clear.

Finally we got a flight that will be the next day and with transfer. I think KLM is a big company and may stand and help their customers to have better easier experience. Send us to a motel where we were given the worse food ever. And that after waiting for shuttle bus for another 2 hours. I never complain, but here we definitely should have been treated better. Such companies must be better organized. Allow people to choose the options of flying on their own. Be able to get out luggage. Be able to let people have choices.

841,Kim Wheeler,United Kingdom,2018-11-23,1,"London to Jakarta via Amsterdam. It’s been a week now since I left the UK. First organising the dogs at Heathrow was a nightmare, four large bags, two large crates and two worried dogs did nothing to help my stress levels and then you add the complete incompetence of KLM that gradually got worse and worse. Iit took 5 hours to get the dogs and myself thru security and check in, had to buy a bigger crate for Bluebell and then the debacle of 'unsure if they can travel now as one crates much bigger than the other one, which only made their first comment of 'oh you have two different sized crates' slightly less irritating, all organised while standing in the middle of Heathrow as the world watched with eager if not a tad annoying interest. I landed at Amsterdam in near hysterics, almost lost it with the KLM staff who gave not one jot of help. I also had nowhere to go as I was told my next flight wouldn't be until the next day at 10am and where’s my dogs? I demanded again and again, finally I heard they were in a pet hotel (which apparently is good, but that didn’t really help my anger. Remember this was business class, I expected something a bit better, no I expected a whole lot better) but that didn’t change my rage. I was then told to 'go out of airport get a shuttle bus to such and such where there is a hotel' - this was when I completely lost it - apparently KLM are supposed to organise all of that rather than leaving this man with four heavy bags in the middle of an airport. I found a hotel in the airport and tried to relax, some hope, then woken at 5am with the phone ringing and a voice telling me, 'that my flight had been cancelled as they didn’t take dogs, next flight 18.00'. Then KLM rang an hour later saying last flight been cancelled and my new flight 20.50. 'How are my dogs, nobody seemed to know or care. So if you are thinking of traveling great distances with your beloved pets, think one hundred times before you make this decision, KLM have offered some apology and some money back, which I find insulting but I will take it. Not the start to this new life that I had so meticulously planned and still angry at the lack of concern throughout this entire journey and to add insult to injury a very valuable collection of my photographs/posters has disappeared and even after waiting for any response as when I might see this valuable collection, there has been no help whatsoever nor have I been paid the offered compensation.",,Business,Business Class,London to Jakarta via Amsterdam,November 2018,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,London,Jakarta,Amsterdam,Negative,-0.7383,  london jakarta via amsterdam week since left uk first organise dog heathrow nightmare four large bag two large crate two worried dog nothing help stress level add complete incompetence gradually get bad bad iit take 5 hour get dog thru security check buy big crate bluebell debacle travel one crate much big one make first comment two different size crate slightly less irritate organised stand middle heathrow world watch eager tad annoy interest land amsterdam near hysteric almost lose staff give one jot help nowhere go next next day 10am dog demand finally hear pet hotel apparently good really help anger remember business class expect something bit well expect whole lot well change rage airport get shuttle bus hotel completely lose apparently suppose organise rather leave man four heavy bag middle airport find hotel airport try relax hope wake 5am phone ring voice tell cancel take dog next rang hour later say last cancelled new dog nobody seem know care think travel great distance beloved pet think one hundred time make decision offer apology money back find insulting take start new life meticulously plan still angry lack concern throughout entire journey add insult injury valuable collection disappear wait response might see valuable collection help whatsoever pay offer compensation

843,Fionn MacKillop,United Kingdom,2018-11-19,6,"Overall this is a bit of a disappointment I have to say. I upgraded with SkyTeam miles (89,900 miles to be precise) from Buenos Aires to Amsterdam (my full itinerary was Santiago de Chile-Edinburgh, but only the previous segment got upgraded). I have been a customer of AF/KLM for well over 10 years, and have never been offered an upgrade or anything, which I believe says a lot about how they value their loyal customers. For this upgrade, I had to repeatedly ask the purser on Santiago-Buenos, then ground staff, before finally getting an answer! Which is still better than when you ask on Messenger or WhatsApp, and they just say 'no' without any kind of explanation--this also needs improving. Anyway, preamble over and onto the product itself. I was in seat 1 C, which had a not very charming view of a corridor leading to the flight deck, past the kitchen etc. There was also some foot traffic around here. There are only 2 toilets for the whole of Biz class on this plane, this is too little as there were queues, and also the toilets are no different from Economy, I believe they should have special touch to justify the increased cost. The seat had some pros, one being turning into lie-flat bed and various other comfy positions; there was a 17 inch IFE screen, but I didn't use it. The blanket was warm enough, and the pillow of good size. I did find the seat a bit dirty (lots of crumbs on the side) and scuffed in some areas. There was also too little storage space (I like having phone, tablets, headphones etc. in easy reach and there was barely enough space for that). The most annoying is the absence of direct aisle access, meaning the person next to you has to step over you or wake you up to get to bathroom etc. This is a big minus in terms of convenience/privacy. The staff were generally helpful, friendly and efficient, though they should come by more often to offer drinks etc. I got extremely dehydrated at one point. The food I'd say was average: a starter of prawns was tasty (though very few prawns!), while the beef mains was chewy and bland; the dessert was dry, and the cheese selection was very limited and not that tasty. There were some good wines (though a limited range), a very tasty cocktail (but awful, dry and not fresh nuts!). The breakfast was certainly better than in economy but a bit so-so too. Coffee was tasty enough. Good touch in terms of cutlery and crockery design, especially the Delft porcelain-style mugs and bowls, very pretty. The little present a Dutch house model filled with Gin, to take home and collect (there are 99 in total) is a sweet touch. Overall, I would keep my miles and spend them on a better business class. I slept poorly due to heavy turbulence (not their fault of course!) and an overheated cabin. The seating lacked privacy and convenience, and the business cabin decor, and food, are lacklustre.",Boeing 777-300 ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Buenos Aires to Amsterdam,November 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,,3,no,True,Buenos Aires,Amsterdam,,Positive,0.9878,  overall bit disappointment say upgraded skyteam mile mile precise buenos aire amsterdam full itinerary santiago de previous segment get upgraded customer well 10 year never offer upgrade anything believe say lot value loyal customer upgrade repeatedly ask purser ground staff finally get answer still well ask messenger whatsapp say without kind explanation need improve anyway preamble onto product seat 1 c charm view corridor lead deck past kitchen etc foot traffic around 2 toilet whole biz class little queues toilet different economy believe special touch justify increase cost seat pros one turn bed various comfy position 17 inch ife screen use blanket warm enough pillow good size find seat bit dirty lot crumbs side scuff area little storage space like phone tablet headphones etc easy reach barely enough space annoy absence direct aisle access mean person next step wake get bathroom etc big minus term staff generally helpful friendly efficient though come often offer drink etc get extremely dehydrated one point food say average starter prawn tasty though prawn beef main chewy bland dessert dry cheese selection limit tasty good wine though limited range tasty cocktail awful dry fresh nut breakfast certainly well economy bit coffee tasty enough good touch term cutlery crockery design especially delft mug bowl pretty little present dutch house model fill gin take home collect 99 total sweet touch overall keep mile spend good business class sleep poorly due heavy turbulence fault course overheat cabin seating lack privacy convenience business cabin decor food lacklustre

Terminal 2 was empty late at night and there was no queue for both business and economy class check in. Check in process was smooth and the ground agent was friendly and helpful. Immigration and security was also straight forward. In both terminals in Taipei there was no priority security lane for business class passengers. KLM uses an older China Airlines lounge in T2. Its basic but comfortable enough and I even prefer it to the flagship T1 lounge. Boarding had commenced when I reached the gate but there was a “Sky Priority” lane for all business class passengers. Once onboard a hot towel and selection of drinks (inc champagne) were offered. We were served two meals – dinner right after taking off and breakfast before landing. Dinner service was efficient so that passengers can catch up some sleep. The crew walked around often to refill champagne and wine which was appreciated. Breakfast was standard quality but after breakfast the crew came out with champagne and it was a nice touch. Overall the service was efficient and faultless although not as personal. Seat on KLM was actually very comfortable. I had a window seat and luckily the seat next to me was not occupied otherwise it would have been a task to step over the neighbour to go to the toilet.

847,A Danenka,Switzerland,2018-11-14,4,"Zurich to Gdansk via Amsterdam. Because we wanted to marry in a different country than we live in, I needed to transport my wedding dress on the plane. We bought the flight tickets for us both 8 months before the wedding and immediately asked KLM customer service if we could transport the wedding dress with us on board (it couldn't be sent as a luggage, because a) it would be destroyed and b) it could go missing because we had to change planes on our way). Customer service answered that yes, it's not a problem, we just need to send the exact dimensions of the dress a few days before the flight. We sent this information 3 weeks before our flight - and then it turned out that our request to take the dress has been denied because it was ""too big"". Of course before no one informed us that they would accept it just if it fits to a given sizes! Very upset and angry, we decided to buy an extra seat for the dress (which, because the flight was so already so close, turned out to be more expensive than the tickets for both of us together!) And then our request was denied once more. The reason: the dress is TOO FRAGILE. They suggested we put it into the luggage. You see, it was too fragile for onboard but apparently not too fragile to be sent with the luggage even though everyone knows how the airlines treat your luggage! Then we told them it's ridiculous and sent the request for buying the extra seat again, and again we were denied! This time they said that the dress is ""too big"" (even though it was smaller and much lighter than e.g. musical instruments, which KLM allows to transport!) We have requested again and again have been denied that it's too big and then we requested again, promising that we gonna bend it three times, so it will be smaller (which of course we were not going to do, because then the dress would be completely destroyed!) - and then finally we were allowed to buy our overpriced seat. Of course, when we were actually flying, the crew was surprised that we had been forced to buy an extra seat - because they were immediately offering us space in the storage closet, which we had requested at the very beginning! And of course no one was trying to force us to bend the dress and of course the dress fit the seat perfectly and wasn't disturbing anyone. What I do not understand, is: what do the people who make such decisions at KLM have against weddings? Why did they force us to go through all that unnecessary stress just before our wedding? The crews and the people from the customer service were really nice - why some decision making clerk, hiding behind the firewall of the customer service, was trying to make our life so unnecessarily miserable?

849,Kah Kay Au,Singapore,2018-11-12,9,"Rio de Janeiro to Amsterdam. The business class on KLM’s B787 Dreamliner is configured in a 1-2-1 arrangement in reverse herringbone layout. I had the window seat 2A. As the seat is angled facing the window, there is a lot of privacy in the window seat. Even in upright mode, a person of average height like myself at 178 cm is able to rest my legs on the ottoman. There is a small storage compartment at the side with a vanity mirror which comes in useful when you want to style your hair after waking up from sleep. A 3-course dinner was served shortly after takeoff from GIG. I opted for the cream of sweet potato soup which was delicious. For the main course, I had the grilled chicken with quail risotto. It was something unusual but nevertheless tasty. Courses were served course by course and the entire dinner service took almost 2.5 hours before I was able to recline into bed mode for a restful 6-hour sleep before breakfast. It was a very pleasant experience and do hope that KLM will have more aircraft with the reverse herringbone configuration in business class. This aircraft was wifi enabled.

856,M Jalena,United States,2018-10-24,9,"This was a Delta flight operated by KLM. I upgraded to business from economy for around $500 at the gate. I was a bit disappointed to find out that the equipment had been changed from a Boeing 787  to a 777 however I was looking forward to the KLM business experience. If you have Air France points always ask because the original price to upgrade was around $900 however just for being a member of the Air France loyalty program, the price dropped down to a little bit under $500 and I did not have to use points. Keep in mind you have to ask and hopefully find an agent that is nice enough to do it for you. Upon boarding, it was obvious that the 777 was old however it was well-kept. The bathroom was very nice and had Dutch themed wallpaper with all kinds of amenities inside. They serve you a hot meal that includes an appetizer,  entrée, and everything you can drink every two hours. They use beautiful china, glass, nice silverware, and beautiful linen napkins. Two hours before landing they serve you a  hot breakfast. They also give you a nice little Dutch themed ceramic house with liquor inside as a  gift which I thought was a lovely touch and your choice of chocolate. The seat was large, very comfortable, and with plenty of storage. The  amenity kit however was quite basic.

861,Nicholas Ward,United Kingdom,2018-10-08,1,"Humberside to Sydney via Amsterdam / Abu Dhabi. They simply did not care. I am a gold member of their loyalty program - I booked my flight on the KLM website - after specifically asking questions about benefits privileges and differences - as the flight was a code share - was told there would be no difference. Lie number 1. I booked the ticket and went to book seats online. I could book KLM seats but not partner (the message on screen said seating plan is currently unavailable try later) - Lie number 2. I called after booking to reserve seats and was told I needed to do this with Etihad, I called Etihad and they said it wasn’t possible and I needed to do this with KLM or at the airport: meaning that I would get whatever seat was available 3 hours before the plane would leave - for an 8 hour and a 14 hr flight that’s just not acceptable - and certainly not like for like with KLM operated flights. When I complained I was told I could cancel my flight at a cost. In the time taken going backwards and forwards between the many KLM service departments other flight costs had risen significantly and I was trapped. After this experience on the way out I asked about upgrades I couldn’t use points for the KLM part and I couldn’t pay for the Etihad part my option was to upgrade to business class which cost more than the original ticket. I have done many long haul flights with various operators - KLM included - some code share some not. I am now sat at the airport waiting for the check in desk to open, I tried on the KLM app where it was not possible, they advised to use the self service at the airport - that’s not possible. So I’m sat here until the desks open, thank you KLM. This is not as described when I specifically asked this stuff before booking.

871,Geoffrey Townsend,United Kingdom,2018-09-12,8,"Southampton to Strasbourg via Amsterdam. I chose to fly with KLM via AMS, with the return journey via CDG - by TGV train to CDG and onward with Flybe (Air France flight number). I made my booking with Expedia. Basically, everything was fine. The flights via Amsterdam were fine but the connection time was a bit tight because of passport control. The return journey was fine - Strasbourg station check-in was excellent, as was the TGV - I shall definitely consider TGV connections via CDG again. However, FlyBE is an experience I do without. Late. Appalling on board catering which they have the cheek to charge for. The flights to AMS and Strasbourg offered acceptable food and drink for free and the service was very correct. What did surprise me was the 40 Euro per checked bag fee in each direction. The Expedia site did not give a warning of this and it was not clear from the ticketing documentation - it came as a surprise at check-in.I hace flown a couple of thousand times and consider myself a seasoned traveller, I know that such fees are common with budget airlines like Ryanair, Easyjet and some US domestic airlines, but I have never experienced this with established airlines like KLM or AF, I normally fly Star Alliance (LH, TK, LX) or Aeroflot. So I was unpleasantly surprised. This represented a hidden charge of ca 30%, and it was not at all clear in the booking process. It would probably not have changed my airline choice or route planning, nut I would have liked to know in advance.

881,G Meares,Sierra Leone,2018-08-28,9,"Seoul to Freetown via Amsterdam. I think KLM has a great product in their new Business seats - fully flat, spacious, and well designed. Whilst the AMSto  Freetown  leg was in their old recliner seats, it was comfortable enough for a relatively short trip. I found staff consistently good - they are friendly, cheerful and fun, and they seem to enjoy their work. The second leg in particular was very attentive, proactive staff, who addressed passengers by name, and were generous with drinks and food. KLM has great tableware, and all of the meals were pretty good too.

882,R Gemirson,United States,2018-08-28,1,Budapest to Boston via Amsterdam. This is the second time I have had the wheels broken off my luggage by KLM or Delta Air Lines. On this particular flight I was traveling for business from Europe to the East Coast and my luggage never arrived. I had a conference to attend on Wednesday evening when I landed which I missed because I had to go buy work clothes. My conference ran through Thursday and I am lucky that I bought more than one outfit because my bag didn’t arrive until Friday even though I was told my bag would arrive the next day! Every time I called the baggage claims department it would take an hour to even speak to anyone. When my bag finally did arrive it was damaged and missing a wheel.  I had to submit two claims one for reimbursement of the clothes I bought and another for my damaged bag.

At the airport boarding was smooth and biz class passengers used their own door to enter (in YYZ only one door used for deboarding but they asked eco passengers to wait for us to get out first). The flight was fully booked but everything worked well and the crew had the nice touch of addressing passengers with their names.

In this morning flight there were no newspapers, their bubbly wine was of the cheapest possible kind (Codorniu, vs. actual champagne served by some airlines, and KLM longhaul), and the breakfast options ran out when they got to row 2 already (though the food I got was still okay, just nothing to choose from).

888,Kimberley Fijman,Thailand,2018-08-17,4,"Amsterdam to Bangkok. Whilst the flight was boarding and I was in my seat I noticed a sickening Sweaty feet smell. Someone had taken of their shoes and the smell was horrendous. I was trying to figure out where it was coming from. After take off when I got up to go to the toilet I saw the lady sitting behind me holding a tissue covering her nose and mouth. The man in 60b next to her was the one were the bad smell came from. I went to speak to the purser and told her the situation and she told me she had smelt it too but also didnt know where it was coming from. I asked her if she could please do something. She basically giggled and said ""what do you expect me to do or say about it"" that is not how you deal with a problem, especially not when you are a customer service manager. (they get trained for these situations) She went to the man and told him carefully about the smell and asked him ""could you please put your shoes in a plastic bag"" and left it at that. It didn't make it any better as the smell was coming from his dirty feet and socks too! After about 20min the smell still hadn't gone and when the purser walked by I told her that it still smells really bad. She said ""the gentleman had put the shoes in a plastic bag"" when I said it is not only his shoes that were the problem but also his socks and feet she basically gave me an angry look and walked away not to been seen for the rest of the flight. I among others were forced to sit in this smell for 10.5 hours from take off till landing. This is unacceptable. I felt super bad for the Thai lady behind me in 60a as she was squashed in her seat as the man was also very big and showed no consideration for her space plus the smell was even more unbearable for her. I think the way the purser went about it was ridiculous. She should have asked him to put his shoes back on and show a little bit more customer care. It is a long haul flight and to sit in that smell for that amount of time is unacceptable, especially if you have paid almost 900 euros for a ticket. I am very disappointed with this service. To make matters worse, after they served breakfast about 1.5 hours before landing the lady in 59c next to me started vomiting. I was handing her more sickbags from other seat pockets. In this time flight attendant walked by and didn't ask the poor woman if she was okay when she was clearly sitting with a sickbag on an aisles seat in full view of the crew passing by. I must say this has been the worst flight I have ever had. I am very disappointed in the lack of care of the crew and ground staff.

891,Paul Beardshaw,United Kingdom,2018-08-10,4,"Birmingham to Minneapolis via Amsterdam. When an airline has so many lost luggage claims that after 45 days, your claim still hasn't been started, you have to ask yourself ""Is KLM the right airline to fly with?"". I have no complaint about the the planes, the staff or the on board experience, they're all pretty good. Where this airline fails is when they delay your flights because of missing catering, lose your luggage, smash that luggage and I lost some valuables. All of this happened to me in one flight. Trying to get their customer care team to acknowledge my claim and begin the investigation is proving to be more difficult than landing a vehicle on Mars. The day after I arrived back, my luggage arrived at my house and it was broken beyond repair, and missing several items.  As I write this, it's been 45 days since I made first contact about this, and my claim is still sitting in a pile of claims, waiting to be started. Each time I call, my claim is being ""escalated to a manager"", only to find out the next time I call that this didn't happen. I've had every excuse available and not their staff hang up when I call. I have to use my colleague's mobiles so the support team does not recognise my number. If you are planning to book with KLM, only do so if you are only taking hand luggage with you, and you're prepared never to make a claim against the airline for anything else because, it's highly unlikely they will process your claim.

Many travelled complained since many connecting flights were not managed and people had to stay overnight in Amsterdam. While staying overnight I was not allowed to have my hand luggage back. In the end such hand luggage didn't reach the final destination and since the ticket on the suitcase was handwritten (done onboard as explained). I really doubt it will ever get back to destination.

907,C Tan,United Kingdom,2018-07-05,6,"KLM is a very efficient carrier in terms of its online check in and customer service interface. However the ground service at London was very poor, so were its lounges. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 4 was a nightmare. Despite being a Sky Priority member traveling on business class the queue was long. Later I realised there was technical issue with the luggage belt in the business class check in section. No explanation was given and there was no attempt to serve business class passengers using economy class check in. The Skyteam lounge in T4 was also very poor. It is a very boring and dated lounge and the F&B offers weren’t great. It was far inferior to the Plaza Premium lounge on the other side of the airport. It was very disappointing to see a substandard Skyteam lounge considering they have so many flights out of T4. The service inflight is what really makes KLM a reputable airlines. The crew were chatty and extremely friendly. Everyone received a warm welcome – not only for business class passengers. Breakfast served was decent – fresh juice, good quality yoghurt and warm pastry. Returning journey was as good as outbound. Skyteam (KLM) lounge 52 was large but very basic considering its KLM’s hub. It felt like a waiting room in a large train station. Gate at Schiphol was crowded and boarding was late, but ground staff were friendly. Crew in the cabin again was first class and very elegant.

910,G Simpson,United States,2018-06-24,1,"We flew as a family of four from Chicago to Cape Town in June 2018, with tickets booked on Delta.com in January. One among our teenage children is a minor. Apparently, we are required to carry a birth certificate for minor children regardless of being on a US passport, to enter South Africa. KLM did not inform us (1) at the time of booking with their Skyteam partner, Delta, on delta.com (2) during online check-in on klm.com and (3) during check-in at O'Hare. Imagine our shock when they did not allow us to board the Amsterdam to Cape Town flight! What followed was a 48 hour nightmare where KLM showed that they did not care about us as customers. Eventually, we did continue our trip after a lot of welcome help from Delta and a lot of personal cost borne by us. The true worth of an airline shows up when things do not go to script. KLM showed that it has neither the technology, nor the process, or the people to operate as a customer-oriented international airline in the 21st century. Shame on you, KLM, for not taking accountability for your deficiencies and for putting us through hell.

I do that each time now but this time was very different as the flight attendant actually directed me to the pilots before take off so that I could ask questions and talk to both (pilot and co-pilot). They asked me at which moment of flying is uncomfortable for me and they gave me some explanations and answered to my questions for 5 minutes.

For my trip from Prague to Moscow, March 14th, I had to make a quick stop in Amsterdam and therefore booked KL1356/KL3178 flights. However, before the flight, I got informed that Amsterdam lag will be operated by Transavia. As a consequence, no comfortable seats available. Such a change makes a big difference, given ridiculously small seat pitch at Transavia. If you value a basic level of comfort, you would avoid Transavia. Unfortunately, I was given no choice. During my online check-in at KLM websites I was also invited to “choose seat for free”. Just to learn, such a choice is in fact not available for me, given Moscow lag is operated by Aeroflot. Puzzled, I asked why it cannot be done given both KLM and Aeroflot are members of SkyTeam alliance. I learned that this is due to the fact that the respective systems are not interconnected as yet and ""choose your seat"" therefore no option. Expression ""as yet"" sounds real pathetic, given KLM is member of SkyTeam for already 14 years and Aeroflot for 12 years. Management of Sky Alliance must be real preoccupied by other issues if there was no time to implement such a simple feature like seat selection. In a summary, my KLM flight was no KLM flight.

During the flight I have been consequently approached in English, even when I returned in Dutch! When returning at Lyon airport I found out there was a power cut at the airport. There was a long queue of passengers who could not be checked in. Security was closed.

At the gate the airbridges did not work and all passengers had to embark after a short walk over the tarmac. Boarding was done manually by checking each passenger on a list.

As a consequence, I had to repurchase baggage allowance. I subsequently emailed both KLM and the travel agency through which I purchased our tickets to have my baggage allowance refunded. However, despite my persistence and an exchange of emails, I have been told by KLM to claim my refund from the travel agency, whilst that travel agency told me to claim from KLM! It is obvious that either one is lying! I am very disappointed to say the least.

My partner  checked in at Malaga as planned and informed the representative at the check in counter that I couldn't get back to Malaga so was going to meet her in Amsterdam.

It cost us an extra £92 on top of the flight which was already more expensive than other airlines. The flight was due to land at Leeds at just after 10pm. However the flight took off and then due to a technical issue had to return to Amsterdam. This is ok but no-one informed us of this, then after waiting we heard the flight the cancelled. Again no one called to say our son was safe, the chaperone we heard took our son to the KLM lounge and left him there with the lounge staff, neither the chaperone or the lounge staff thought to use the big folder around the child's neck to call the parents. Therefore we were running around Leeds trying to find out what was going on. We had called family in Amsterdam whom had return to the airport to see what was going on there also but no-one knew. Eventually at 01.30 we tracked him down to the KLM lounge. KLM never offered any apology or a hotel as thy are supposed to. Why didn't the chaperone or lounge staff call us. To me this is nothing more than neglect. KLM took 2 weeks to answer my email of complaint and then took 2 more to come back with an offer of the flight payment up to £250 plus £92 for the service and £100 family day if we paid for it first and sent them the receipt. The way they have been with us I am not sure they would do this so wouldn't spend that extra money on the off chance. I believe this is totally unacceptable as we are entitled by eu law for the flight money back so they for company like this to offer a £100 voucher for child neglect just goes to show how much emphasis they put on childrens well being.

After a quick coffee and a toilet break we left for the boarding gate. Well, even worse - there is a long queue for passport control. When we got to the gate it was already boarding time. The 777 was ok. Slightly angled seats with a tiny tiny foothold. I am 5.6 and my feet barely fit in it. When flat the bed is comfy but one has to angle ones feet sideways. The blanket is soft and warm. Service was very efficient but at times I couldn’t find any staff. Since it was a daylight flight I had to watch TV and eat. Food wasn’t great - beef curry was a reconstituted shredded beef without any flavour. The other choices were worse. Drinks were good. The pre-arrival snack was a dec3nt hamburger but it was cold. The amenity kit was poor - worse than most economy class. Just a pair of sock, toothbrush and toothpaste. And an eyeshade. We had a 1.5 hour delay due to a technical issue, which is not the airline’s fault, but still, they didn’t give us any drinks or snacks until after an hour. All in all, KLM has a lot to catch up on, even just within its group, to Air Feance’s standard. We flew AF in March, also business class, and it is a much superior airline. The French has a flair for service and food, while the Dutch has efficiency.

982,G Morton,United Kingdom,2018-01-01,1,"Dammam to Amsterdam. Watch out if you pay for an upgrade and are unlucky enough to either get downgraded or have a cancelled flights. You may find yourself in a position of receiving a email or notice on KLM's app that you can upgrade to a economy comfort or business class seat for anything between 50 Euros to 500 Euros. A word of warning if you do. 1- If you upgrade from your original seat and pay between 50 Euros to 500 Euros for the upgrade and then have your flight cancelled KLM will rebook your flights back to the original seat class only with no automatic refund on your upgrade. You have to go through a 2 week refund process which you have to initiate by applying for first with no guarantee of a refund at the end! You will be told ""the reason we could not rebook your upgraded seat is because these are not available on your rebooked flight"". But when I logged on to KLM's website or App I notice that the upgraded seats are still available. Only this time they are substantially more expensive to upgrade to, because they know that there are more people willing to upgrade because of the cancelled flights. If like me you check the upgrade as soon as you get your ticket and find the highest upgrade available is a economy comfort seat and you pay for that upgrade as soon as you can you may find yourself in a sticky situation if business class becomes available closer to departure time and you upgrade further. Because, and I quote a customer services rep on the phone ""It is KLM's policy not to refund any earlier upgrade to economy comfort if you then upgrade to business class"". KLM has already failed to honour your original upgrade from the day before, failed to give you a automatic refund and will keep your money for 14 days and then hiked the price of that upgrade to around $100 more for the same flight the next day. And now are refusing to give a refund for a lesser upgrade booked earlier which has been superseded by paying the premium price for business class upgrade. All in all KLM are  not customer focused and are only focused on your money, making it easy for you to hand over and hard for you to get back if anything goes wrong. Whilst flying out of Dammam we have had our flight delayed (above flight) due to fog, we watched as all the other airlines gave their passengers information, hotel, transport as it was very clear that we would not be leaving that night. It took KLM 15 hours to get their passengers out of the airport, and still we were not given any information.

994,Kazuo Yokoyama,Germany,2017-12-19,10,"Tokyo to Berlin via Amsterdam, and had an excellent experience. Though the first flight had a delay and we hardly arrived on time at the connecting flight to Amsterdam, the ground staff reopened the gate and let us in. At Amsterdam Schiphol airport there was bad weather so there were a lot of passengers coming late. Unfortunately our baggage did not make it in time which I totally understand considering the circumstance of a connecting time below 20 min. When we arrived in Tokyo Narita the ground staff already prepared a baggage loss claim form with our names on it and informed us that the baggage will probably arrive the next day but latest the day after the next day. So we went shopping to get some necessary clothes for the next day, assuming that the baggage will arrive soon. I got e-mails, facebook, whatsapp and sms notifications that the baggage is already on the flight to Tokyo-Narita. The next I called the ground staff to ask for any news and they could not say anything specific, but called back a few hours later to inform us, that our baggage will arrive in the evening between 5 and 10 pm at the place in Tokyo, where we stayed. About half past 6 the baggage arrived. Excellent. Then I filled in the compensation form for the clothes I had to buy, and got a response within 2 days that the total cost of about 110 EUR will be refunded within 2-3 weeks. With Etihad I am still waiting after more than 1 month for any response for the reimbursement after I had a flight cancellation with a nightmare experience. With KLM I  felt that all the people are very concerned about any detail that is relevant for the passenger experience. Problems always arise at some point but how an airline company deals with it, makes a difference. From a passenger perspective, I really don't know, what they could have done better.

I left in early August and now sitting at the airport waiting to go back to LAX (now December 18).

Anyhow, I arrived 3 hours early and I still did not make my plan flight and now KLM has to buy me another ticket out. The worst part is the service. I'm not one to complain and make a scene.

997,S Cooper,Netherlands,2017-12-12,2,"Flew Copenhagen to Amsterdam. Good if nothing bad happens. Overall KLM offers a good service and has a great flight network. However, as soon as something goes wrong, don't count on this airline. I have now experienced it for the second time that a flight has been cancelled due to bad weather conditions and KLM just did not manage to provide any support. There is a busy hotline and the fact that you may miss your original connection once bad weather hits is totally understandable. The way how KLM reacts to this, however, is incredibly bad. In both cases, the airline sent an e-mail telling us that they would contact us within the next three hours, but in fact, they never (not even after two days) write or call back. You cannot reach the hotline (you get disconnected after one hour of waiting) or their Whatsapp support. When I tried to re-book online (which they offer for free under these conditions and advice you to do in their cancellation e-mail), the online-system aborts the re-booking process and displays a random error message. What worked for me last time is to book a flight with another airline and ask for a ticket refund at KLM. In sum, the airline just dumped me and didn't manage to provide any support.

I boarded the plane with trusting them. They delayed my luggage (4 bags 23 kg each).

Flew KLM in 2013 and noted that 4 years later in 2017 KLM new Y seat of B777-300ER is narrower than the seats of 2013 and there was no footrest anymore which makes the long range travel less comfortable.

After lunch duty free sales with great selections at attractive price (cheaper than Airport Bangkok). Unlike other airlines after lunch and duty free sale most of crews were still on duty and came often with soft drinks and ice cream during the rest time. Before landing at AMS we got 1 cold meal. After landing KLM crews still on “enthusiasm service” helping passengers took out the cabin baggage/ saying thank you and goodbye with smiles.

If things go wrong, you face an upward battle against limited options (flights), limited resources (costumer services, customer assistance). I paid 1700 euro for a comfort seat and they left me stranded in Amsterdam. No duty of care to be sure that I reach my final destination from the KLM side. Out the door the EU legal requirements.  The plane out of Houston has an issue, KLM needs to get it fixed. Paperworks and repairs take 4 hours. Most passengers already miss the connecting flights before departure. Staff at the gate scare people away which see the issues coming because of their prior experiences. Before we fly, they have to get some drunken passengers of the plane including the one sitting next to me. Not even a Sorry Sir. Service degree as in nineties, AC dripping, cold all night, no new water bottle - I will fill it up for you Sir (really in comfort).

1012,F Kraatz,Germany,2017-11-03,3,"✅ Verified Review   
My customer journey with KLM left an incredible impact that marketing specialists can only dream of. It kept going on for over a month longer than my actual journey with KLM and created a number of lasting memories. The actual journey, however, never quite unfolded its full potential like a butterfly that's stuck in his cocoon. What a shame, I've heard many others say that KLM is a great airline. I can only verify this partially as out of the 4 flights I booked with KLM, I ended up only taking one. Here is why: One day before my departure from Berlin to Osaka, I received news that my connecting flight from Amsterdam to Osaka was cancelled. During the darkest hours of the night, some courageous customer service worker managed to put me on a Finnair flight which turned out to be a more than decent replacement. However, my chance to experience the Dutch Air Hospitality that KLM is renowned for was delayed. Talking about delayed, let me tell you the story of my flight home. The long haul from Osaka to Amsterdam was the only one out of the 4 KLM flights that I ended up taking. Once you manage to actually catch a KLM flight that's not cancelled, you receive warm and friendly service by the crew, decent-tasting food and a wide range of the latest cinematic enterainment options plus games and series. They even had some automatic kind of window blinds that turned the windows into a dark shade of blue (instead of the typical plastic blinds you get). This was very nice. I only wish I'd stayed up in the air for longer because as soon as we touched down in Amsterdam Schiphol, the chaos resumed. My flight to Berlin-Tegel was cancelled and I had to search for a replacement along with the numbers of other passengers who experienced a similar fate on that day. I arrived at Schiphol at 2 pm. The following hours included: me waiting in line - me being booked on a Lufthansa flight - being sent back from Lufthansa boarding because my name didn't get forwarded to Lufthansa - waiting in line again - being put on the waiting list for the KLM flight to Berlin later that evening - being sent back from boarding again because I didn't make it off the waiting list into the plane. Gotta mention that the customer service at Schiphol was very helpful the whole time, going through all possible options with me (I was disappointed that a rental car wasn't one, though!). You should have seen the look on the lady's face when I came back after the second failed connection around 9 pm. After 7 hours of from-A-to-B at Schiphol I resigned and agreed to a train connection the next morning and a hotel stay. These worked out. Unfortunately, my backpack got stuck in the loop at Schiphol and couldn't be given to me while I was there. It had to be claimed as ""missing"" and mailed to my address afterwards. Turns out the claim became real. My backpack really went missing and I had to wait 3 more weeks for it until receiving basically my whole wardrobe and souvenirs.

1014,Aart de Vos,Netherlands,2017-10-31,8,"✅ Verified Review   Amsterdam to Billund. This trip was made in conjunction with the phase out of the Fokker F70 in KLM Cityhopper service. I deliberately booked this flight as a last salute to one of my favourite aircraft in which I logged almost 150 flights in the last 10 years. The outbound flight from Amsterdam to Billund was with a KLM mainline Boeing 737, nothing special, on time departure and arrival with the standard onboard service of a coffee and a snack. The return flight, in this case the very last Fokker 70 flight from Billund to Amsterdam ever started as a complete let-down at the gate, business as usual, just a bunch of absolutely unfriendly gate agents. However when boarding the aircraft everything changed totally. The aircraft cabin was decorated with little flags and once all passengers boarded, the captain entered the cabin and welcomed all passengers and explained why this flight was a special event. It was also the entire crew's last flight on the Fokker 70. Upon departure to the main runway we received a water salute from the Billund fire brigade, followed by a very powerful take-off and a low-level bye bye pass over the airport. Onboard service during the flight was standard but the cabin crew did everything to make the flight memorable, well done! Landing in Amsterdam was on the rarely used Eastern runway which is the runway used in the past by the Fokker company to test fly and deliver their aircraft to their customers. Upon disembarking all passengers were personally greeted by the captain and both cabin crew. We will miss the faithful little Fokkers!","Boeing 737, Fokker 70",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Billund,October 2017,3.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,,4,yes,False,Amsterdam,Billund,,Positive,0.775,  verify review amsterdam billund trip make conjunction phase fokker f70 cityhopper service deliberately book last salute one favourite log almost 150 flight last 10 year outbound amsterdam billund mainline boeing 737 nothing special time departure arrival standard onboard service coffee snack return case last fokker 70 billund amsterdam ever start complete gate business usual bunch absolutely unfriendly gate agent however board everything change totally cabin decorate little flags passenger board captain enter cabin welcome passenger explain special event entire crew last fokker 70 upon departure main runway received water salute billund fire brigade follow powerful bye bye pas airport onboard service standard cabin crew everything make memorable well do land amsterdam rarely use eastern runway runway use past fokker company test fly deliver customer upon disembark passenger personally greet captain cabin crew miss faithful little fokkers

1017,B Ridgewell,United Kingdom,2017-10-24,1,"✅ Verified Review   Manchester to Antananarivo via Amsterdam. My new husband lost his passport 2 days before our wedding, 5 days before flying to Madagascar. After a  passport office appointment they said it would likely be done by Mon/Tues when we were meant to be flying Monday. On Monday we were home waiting for the post hoping the passport would arrive before our evening flight that we booked with lastminute.com (spoiler alert, it didn't.) First thing we rang lastminute.com  to ask the costs for changing flights and get advice on the best options if it didn't arrive, after being on hold for a whole 60 minutes they said not their problem they wont help and we need to ring KLM . So we rang KLM and the first person said they didnt know how much but it wouldn't be a problem to change and they would email the details through, so we waited a while. Then rang KLM again who said not sure whats happening but they would email again, then they of course didnt. Then rang KLM again who said not their problem we should ring last minute.com Long story short we bounced between lastminute.com and KLM and not a single person we spoke to would help us or point us in the right direction. Now we treated ourselves with an expensive holiday for our once in a lifetime honeymoon but we are by no means able to just throw money away, and as noone would help after 6 solid hours of ringing people, we drove to manchester airport to see if anyone on a desk there would help. Turns out as i stand there making a fool out of myself sobbing my eyes out at the KLM desk they won't help us either and told us to ring the KLM number. So I had to make a decision, as we were unable to see if our flights could be changed to another day for a reasonable cost and in a panic of not being able to afford new flights for both of us I checked in myself and left him behind to sort this mess, in the end he just had to buy completely new flights, which also meant he couldn't fly back with me. I appreciate this whole mess was caused by a stupid mistake of my husbands, but seriously how hard is it to talk to someone about a change of flight . And even if it isn't something you can help with, how hard is it to not lie and say you will help but then don't, or even how hard is it to treat people with a little empathy and kindness. Every single person i have had to deal with from KLM, from the phone, helpdesk, check in desk and flight attendants were rude and looked like the last thing they wanted to do was do their job properly.

1018,Loay Osman,United Arab Emirates,2017-10-24,9,"✅ Verified Review   DXB-AMS-UIO and GYE-AMS-DXB. Dubai to Quito and Guayaquil to Amsterdam, 3 legs in B777-200 and last leg in B777-300. It is the first time I have travelled with KLM and I must say it won’t be the last. I am really impressed with the quality of everything: fantastic clean aircrafts, comfortable seats, leg space which is the largest in the industry I believe for economy class, very experienced Pilots with smooth take offs and landings (in the Andes Mountains to be specific) amazing entertainment with Arabic movies and Halal food options on the Dubai legs, but most important I have to praise the flight attendants. They might be mostly above the 45 age range but they were all very active throughout the 4 legs I had with KLM, even the 12 hrs flights and they handled the situation of the delay due to the technical error with a lot of experience and patience and never showed any attitude to any passenger even the Humble Andean old ladies sitting next to me. They were very friendly and helpful especially to me to make me catch my connection in Amsterdam and they let me go first off the plane. They kept me informed about my Dubai flight situation. Even when my luggage didn’t make it to my Dubai flight the situation was handled in a very professional way. I arrived in Dubai and headed to the lost luggage desk to be surprised that the agent was emailed by KLM about my luggage situation and informed me that my luggage would be delivered on the next flight which was emailed to me as well by the airline. My luggage arrived safely and was delivered to me followed by another apology email for the incident. No wonder KLM is the oldest airline still in service and celebrating 98 years.

1025,M Hogan,United Kingdom,2017-10-06,1,"✅ Verified Review   Bahrain to Cardiff via Amsterdam. As customers we have to except that cancellations do happen & that more often than not the decision to cancel is taken with our safety in mind. Every airline can run well under normal circumstances but a good test of a airline is to see how they cope with situations like these. KLM were aware of bad weather & by the time my flight had arrived had already cancelled a lot of flights, with this in mind you would of thought that a large business would ensure that they have enough staff on hand not only in the airport but also online & on the end of the phone to cope with the very predictable customer demand that would inevitably ensue. Not the case with KLM. Arrived in Amsterdam to a flight board of mostly delayed or cancelled flights, then had to virtually beg to get into the Crown Lounge with a Petroleum card despite being fully entitled to enter, I was later told that KLM staff were trying to reduce the amount of people in the lounge due to the cancellations. What is the point of issuing loyal customers with a privilege card if you are not prepared to give them the privilege in the first place? Upon being emailed & texted that my flight was cancelled I was given a link to click to re-arrange my flight, brilliant I thought, not brilliant as the link took me to a blank page. Not a problem I will go to the customer service desk & sort this. I (together with a lot of other people) had to wait for over 1hr and 30mins just to be seen, by which time all other seats were taken & waiting lists were at least ten deep for that days remaining flights. Not a problem, as I (& many others) hold a privilege card this takes my to the front of the ""waiting list"" for last minute seats, this is one of the major selling point of the privilege card system. But apparently when you most need this service KLM are not ready to honour it, leaving you as a loyal customer with no extra benefits that KLM had previously promised you in order to get your business & loyalty in the first place. 3 hours later I managed to re-book my flight, 5 hours later I managed to get to the hotel, to be far after this everything seems to be running ok. However, when you compare this airline to how other airlines cope with disruption KLM falls well short of just achieving basic organisation let alone good customer service. When you have your flight cancelled with KLM you will receive a voucher for 15 euros off inflight duty free which was not valid on my flight as my flight is under 70 minutes in duration. Or 2000 air miles credited to your account but only after you learn to read Dutch to decipher the voucher you have been given & then post in all your boarding passes & receipts to a international address, which will probably cost you the same in postage as the miles are worth. This is after you have tried to re-book your flight using one of the three online services they advertise, non of them worked & no response was received from any for over 12 hours. So in all likely hood you will have a 1 hour 30 minute wait to see a (understandably) fed up customer service rep.

I was assured it would be put on the next flight and would be delivered to me at my hotel. Sad to say this never happened. On contacting the baggage handlers at the airport, they again assured me the item would be on that night's flight and forwarded to me etc. Again it did not happen and this was repeated for the duration of my stay in Israel, from the 9th until 14th of Sept. It is now the 25th of September and despite being assured by KLM that my missing baggage would now be forwarded to my home address, it has not happened.

I chose KLM for this trip because of an extremely attractive price offered at the time of booking. The price was so good I upgraded to Economy Comfort which I believe is worth the extra cost.

After using the facilities and finding an open seating area for some relaxation and online activities, I discovered that my cell phone in its clip-on holster was missing from my belt.

1050,G Damarelo,Germany,2017-08-21,1,"✅ Verified Review   Barcelona to Lima via Amsterdam. The overall experience with KLM was a nightmare. We arrived at the airport in Barcelona and Transavia was not able to print our boarding cards for the second flight (Amsterdam - Lima). Due to bad weather, we had to sit for 90 minutes in the aircraft, waiting to take off. Due to the delay, we had 15 minutes to make it to the second flight in Amsterdam but since we had no boarding cards, we had to rush in to the transfer desk. At that point the Schiphol airport was already a completely chaos. Queues everywhere. Not info at all where should you start queueing and so on. We lost our flight and had to wait in line for 8 hours to get a re-booking. KLM told us that the next flight (the following day) was full, but we could fly via Bogotá to Lima. We didn't want to do another connection but KLM said that they would only cover the hotel for one night (August in Amsterdam, not a lot of budget options to stay overnight). Our agent in Schiphol was extremely rude. I can understand that she had an awful day, but waiting in line for 8 hours is neither fun.

The following day we took the flight and landed in Lima without luggage. Nobody knew where it was. When contacting KLM they said that they were not responsible for our accommodation but Transavia and that regarding our baggage, we had to contact Avianca, the airline which brought us from Bogotá. 64 hours later (plus an overnight in Amsterdam with our luggage locked at the airport) we just received our bags.

While Premium Economy (which is offered by other airlines) is usually a different service class with more generous seats and slightly better service, Economy Comfort seats are standard economy seats with more legroom and 50% more recline (on long haul flights). The service is exactly the same as in Economy. However, Economy Comfort seats are usually much more affordable than Premium Economy seats.

On almost all other airlines you an choose an emergency row seat when you are lucky enough to be one of the first to check in. But on KLM, no way. If you do not want to pay extra then you are stuck in the seats with less than 30 inch seat pitch. Now I am 196 cm tall where most of my height is in the legs, so a 30 inch seat pitch is just far too little. KLM won't even let you move after the freight has started unless you pay. On most other airlines I have never complained about this because I had a chance to choose an emergency row seat, but I am a really strong believer in the fact that I should not pay more to have the same kind of comfort as a person only being 170 cm.

For the most part these were good quality KLM transatlantic flights, with on-time departure/arrival, comfortable seating (Economy Comfort leg-room is well worth the extra outlay when you're flying long-haul) and a friendly cabin crew.

Crews were polite and attentive. Eco comfort seating was lovely. Their European catering is strange, but since there is a full bar service, not much to be unhappy about.

1067,O Janssen,Netherlands,2017-06-15,7,"✅ Verified Review  Amsterdam to Toronto with KLM in 787-9 Dreamliner economy class. It was a while ago flying a long haul flight with KLM and I was a bit concerned after many good flights with Singapore Airlines in recent years. But I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, service was much better than my last KLM long haul flight to Dar es Salaam. The crew were friendly and pretty attentive. Secondly, the food was tasty. It started with dinner (evening flight), finished with cheese quiche and ice cream in between. No problem to get more food if you left hungry and ask for. Enough drinks including wine, beer etc. Last but not least, the aircraft and IFE. For an 8 hour flight the seat width and pitch are reasonable. The electronic dimmable shades do work, mood lighting is nice and cabin noise is relatively low. In my opinion the biggest advantage of the 787 is the increased humidity compared to older aircraft. Nice IFE touch screen. However, if you look at the details my previous A350 flights with Singapore Airlines scored better on almost every aspect. KLM 787-9 is lacking a separate IFE control unit (for people who like gaming) and the screen is not adjustable, there could be more lavatories and it would be better if it had manual shades. Also the A350 cabin is a little bit wider. It would be nice if KLM replace their plastic cutlery for metal and replace the paper hot towels for cotton. The efficiency of meal service could be better as well (it was not very organised). Overall I was satisfied.

In both Amsterdam as well in Norwich I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. The Crown Lounge in the Non-Schengen area of Schiphol Airport was crowded but well stocked for breakfast. The lounge in Norwich is a contractor lounge with limited amenities but featured a reasonable WIFI network. The flights were the typical KLM Cityhopper regional service. The outbound flight was delayed with approx. 45 min and the return flight with almost 2 hours. On both airports the ground staff had chosen to provide their passengers only the bare minimum of information about the delay. I only learned from the captain on the return flight that today's delays were due to faults in the underground fuel system at Amsterdam Schiphol airport. On both flights, the onboard service consisted of a pre-packed waffle and a pre-packed cup of water. To my surprise on the flight to Norwich coffee or tea were offered considering the 30min. flying time. The outbound flight to Norwich was a Embrear 190 substituting the usual Embrear 175 while the return flight was operated by a Fokker 70.

I requested a vegan meal which did not go through to them, so I was left with no options on the flight for food - the flight attendant just offered me an apple when I brought it to their attention - this was a mistake of the airline. I accidentally left a jumper on the plane and contacted KLM immediately. They were quite hard to get a hold of - I waited on the phone for ages before giving up and messaging them through facebook which they have finally responded (slowly). In regards the the jumper they told me to contact abu dhabi airport and when I did, abu dhabi told me it was the responsibility of the airline if I left it on their plane.

A long trip by any standard, made further complicated by KLM routing me via CDG when there is a direct flight from AMS to EDI! Firstly, check in at Lima was a mess, taking an hour in a badly organised queue with people getting angry. Then departure was 40 mins late with no explanation given. Also, despite checking in as soon as check in was open, KLM did not let me choose a seat ('unavailable' for some reason) and placed me in a middle seat, between 2 strangers! For a 12 hour flight. The seats were very hard on the Boeing 777, and the food was quite bad, at the level of hospital food or worse. IFE showed the same films I'd seen on the way there (with AF, a better experience). Then, arriving in AMS and tired after a long trip, I asked if I could not be put on the direct flight to EDI so as to save time and hassle; I was given robotic answers that this was 'impossible' with no explanation. After that, I find out that the Amsterdam to Paris flight is 30 minutes, then 1 hr late, making me fear I'd lose my connection! I barely made it, having to run in Paris CDG. Of course, luggage did not make it.

1097,Suryaputra Wijaksana,Indonesia,2017-04-07,7,"✅ Verified Review  It's always a pleasure to fly with KLM on this route from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. Check in and boarding is always easy and hassle free. Enough information was given before the flight-boarding time, gates, etc. The ground crew were efficient and friendly. However I was not aware the departure time was 16.20, as I remembered it being 17.10. But no matter because we have reached the gate early. On board, the FA's only serve veggie pie which was not delicious. Beverage selection was great with wine served on request. The airline should seriously consider to change their ""veggie pie"" menu.

1099,M Larter,Germany,2017-03-29,9,"✅ Verified Review   Frankfurt to Curaçao via Amsterdam. I had read a lot of negative remarks that we chose KLM rather resentfully, but the itinerary from FRA was more convenient than Air Berlin. For Curaçao, there was no other reasonable choice. This little competition makes the tickets rather pricy in comparison to flights to Asia. Their website is awful in many respects (I would have to fill pages, so I don't write why), that made our expectations not very happy either. We were very surprised that none of our prejudices turned out to be confirmed. Not a single delay, on the contrary - we reached all destinations up to 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Friendly staff on ground and in the air. On both long hauls, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful - we are accustomed to Asian Airlines and have become quite fastidious about service, but this reached the same level. Our prebookings of gluten free and Hindu meals had been lost by their sappy website, but the staff did their utmost to compose some convenient replacement food for us and re-ordered instantly our meals for the return flight (with success). The quality of the food itself was average but edible. The movie entertainment consisted mainly of stale news, mainstream thrillery, or animations which I preferred because the screens are not good enough for any dark scene in a normal movie - you see nothing but a black screen. Because of the cheap earbuds, acoustics qualities are very low and it was hard to understand much of the dialogues in English (English subtitles would help a lot!) - and there were few films in German. Seats were okay and there was enough legroom, so that we could even slide down a bit and sleep.

1101,Laurence McCarthy,Malaysia,2017-03-25,8,"✅ Verified Review   London to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam. First flight with KLM and was a bit apprehensive, as connection from London was very short. The SkyTeam Lounge at Heathrow is adequate, enough space to sit and have a quiet drink and a snack. There is WiFi. Catering OK, but my usual carrier is Etihad, so the experience was a little different, no a la carte table service. Flight boarded at T4 from the gate opposite the Lounge, very convenient. At Schipol we had just about 50 minutes from touchdown to the onward connection, which was enough time to have a quick drink, find our way to the gate and immediately board the next flight. With such a short connection I was worried our luggage wouldn't make the flight, but when we arrived at KUL there it was! The new World Business Class is very open and comfortable. The seating is great, save for the fact that you have no direct aisle access for the window seat. If you are travelling as a couple this is fine, for solo travellers it might prove tiresome. The on-board service was great, the staff were attentive and extremely helpful. The catering was OK, very Dutch shall we say! The drinks were good quality, but a bit mean. Nothing that one could really grumble about. The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new and classic programming to keep me entertained until bed time! The bed is great and I slept like a baby. Even though they are older aircraft I like the sense of space you get with the Boeing 777, which somehow you don't quite feel on other aircraft even the 380. The price was comparable to Etihad (about GBP 300 more) but the flight is 1hr to AMS, a 1hr layover and then a 12hr leg to KUL. Reverse journey the same timings. For EY you have a 3 or 4 hour layover and now they have adjusted their timetable you have to either leave UK early in the morning or arrive very late to KUL. The KLM timings are much friendlier.

The flight was scheduled to leave Houston at 15:35 and the day of the flight an email was sent out stating there would be a delay until 17:00, this was fine. The delay was ""due to operational constraints"", which I understood as issues with the plane's usual functions. At the rescheduled time of departure, one would expect that the issue would be resolved. This was not the case. The pilot was able to explain to us that one of the engines was having mechanical issues and an engineer would assess the situation. After an additional hour or so of delay it was decided that the plane was not in suitable condition to fly. I'm grateful for the discretion here. The passengers were asked to leave the plane and given no direction afterward. They offered hotel accommodation for out of town visitors as reparation. After exiting the secure area of the terminal the crowd of passengers could not find anyone to help us. I personally heard four contradictory statements on who to contact to reschedule the flight. After calling the number provided to me by an unruly ground worker for KLM, I was put on hold for a Delta helpline and the call was lost.

Because of the problems with engine, we had to land in Chicago. After this unexpected rupture of the flight, my friends and I had to wait for more than two hours to receive hotel vouchers. KLM personnel told us to wait outside of the airport for a free shuttle to get to the hotel, but the shuttle never arrived (we were waiting for more than one hour). We were calling and calling the hotel, but it never responded. After we took a taxi and reached, finally, the hotel, it turned out there were no vacant rooms for us there. The hotel's personnel sent us to another location (another taxi on our expense), and we were lucky to find vacant rooms there - it was about 3 am. Overall, it took us about five hours to have finally a rest after we landed.

So, until I arrived to Frankfurt, I did not know whether Aeroflot would take me or not, Thanks God, it did.

Angry protests via their Facebook page and over the phone have elicited nothing beyond 'come to the airport to find out your options'. That will take at least two hours and may be pointless, but since they will not confirm whether or not I will be able to take the flight before tomorrow evening, I have no choice. Also, because it leaves at 19,00, so if they do bump me, as they apparently intend to do, all other alternative flights will have left, and there will be no chance of getting away before 19th - at the earliest.

1160,M Peters,United States,2016-10-26,1,"✅ Verified Review   Flew Houston to Hamburg via Amsterdam with KLM. The plane was very old, the entertainment system didn’t work, had to be reset for the entire plan, and still went out halfway through the flight. Clearly the crew were aware that it was a recurring problem. If you know your entertainment system is not working, you should disclose it in advance. Also, 8,000 points is not adequate compensation for it not working. If you listed a seat for sale and disclosed the fact that the entertainment system didn't work, you would have to offer more than an 8,000 point discount for someone to purchase it vs. a working seat. The plane in general was old, seats did not recline and return properly. The complete disregard for these obvious issues made me wonder what other, less visible, ways the maintenance of the plane was neglected.

1170,Stepan Hrobar,Austria,2016-09-29,8,"✅ Verified Review   Flying KLM from Taipei to Amsterdam. The original flight scheduled for September 27 was cancelled because of typhoon hitting Taiwan, but KLM informed us even the day before (they cancelled the AMS-TPE flight as well) and they sent us new boarding documents immediately. As our schedule has been postponed for 24 hours, I contacted the KLM support via Facebook, which was very effective and friendly option of customer care, they even offered us another flight on the original day of departure with China Airlines, but we chose to stick to the original rebooked flight mostly because of the typhoon (the CI finally departed with a huge delay). The Facebook support also helped us arrange the seats we wanted to, very good way to communicate with customer! The flight itself was just OK. Their B777-300ER in the original configuration (no new economy class) feels very cramped and a little outdated, the seats are not very comfortable, IFE has a great selection of movies, but is very slow and only controllable via remote (which sometimes did not work properly). We paid a little extra to get the coupled seats in the rear of the cabin, and it was definitely worth it, but still for a 13 hour flight it wasn't ideal.

1171,Deborah Renay,Belgium,2016-09-22,6,"Our first experience with KLM was certainly not optimal, but they have their subsequently excused themselves. Hopefully this was a one-off less pleasant experience. We left with KLM from Brussels to Amsterdam Schiphol to switch to another KLM flight to Bangkok. At our first flight was already wrong: technical problem with the brakes, impossible to leave. After an hour delay we left, and we find out onboard the plane that just connections after 18h (we left at 17:45) were possible. We finally came to Amsterdam to 17h15, where we walked fast with the whole family (traveling with two children) to be told at the gate that we were rebooked via Kuala Lumpur. First of all, we have never asked this but eventually I assume KLM does this only with good intentions. Yet when we were at the gate with children and luggage, the plane was still there, and more people were still boarding and we were not allowed on the plane! KLM decided us to book via Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok, adding a lot of time to our booked journey. The reaction of the staff on the spot was not friendly at all. Eventually, we have to abide by their decision, we were not allowed on the flight, so we went back to the KLM information counter. There they confirmed we had an extra few hours waiting to catch the flight to Kuala Lumpur. When you take such a long journey with children and you book in advance your seats on the plane, we then discovered that we could not sit together as a group of 4, but the staff was able to keep us places 2-2 adjacant in the middle row with 4 seats and 2 seats next to us free so that we would have more space . How do you explain to me that we cannot sit side by side with 4 seats, but with two and two empty seats?Leaving Kuala Lumpur again a technical fault with our plane to Bangkok, again more than 30min delay.

The general feel of the airplane was that it needs to be updated. The food was ok, the seat and leg room were ok (although the reclining seat was clunky and didn't work very well), the staff was great, but the entertainment part was definitely behind, and there were no plugs for smart phones or computers. First, they didn't provide ear buds. I came prepared and had my own. Even if you have your own, you need to ask for an adapter, precisely because of the age of their entertainment system. Their entertainment system is old (think probably from the early 90s). The colors on the screen were awful and you could barely see anything. I skipped all the major blockbusters in the selection, because watching them in such poor conditions would be ridiculous. The choice of movies was ok, but quite average compared to other modern airlines. On top of all that, my unit was not working properly for the whole beginning of the trip, and because of that, the call button for the staff was also not working. Eventually, I was able to grab someone from the staff and they had to reset the unit.

I traveled with a second person and we bought our tickets a month before the date. We started at Baltimore and got assigned seats for our Baltimore to New JFK flight as well as the flight from New York JFK to Amsterdam. When we landed in Amsterdam for our travel to Stockholm we were told that we weren't guaranteed a ticket and that we had to fly standby. This made no sense because we had bought our tickets a month ago and because we checked in to all our flights more than 24 hours before the flight to Stockholm. After much drama and waiting, we ended up getting seats but not sitting together. After more than 24 hours of travel and hundreds of dollars spent on these tickets it was a huge disappointment to not be able to sit next to my partner. We definitely were not the last ones to buy the tickets or to check in at the airport. The staff didn't have a good explanation and while they were friendly and courteous I am not inclined to fly with this airline again due to their incompetent way of assigning seats. This was too stressful and there are dozens of other airlines to choose from. In summary I felt cheated - I did not get what I paid for when traveling with KLM.

I enquired why and he said that in business and first they are on the seats and I'm flying in economy where they are never given out prior to departure. Weird that I have always had them before waiting for me (so did their sister air France). The worst aspect was the seat. Absolutely no leg space.

I fly on a weekly basis and annually board long haul flights multiple times and have never experienced such discomfort on a plane.

The inflight service was excellent - good catering (both Japanese-based on the recipes of the famous Yamasato restaurant at the Okura in Amsterdam and western), and portions were copious. The atmosphere in the 787 cabin is very pleasant. However, staff hinted that there was little space for them in the pantries and that this hindered them in providing the desired service levels - not noted by me, at least. The flight departed on time and arrived 30 minutes early. With the upgraded cabin lay-out in its old 747s and its 777s, KLM is now scoring high among its European competitors.

1221,Mike Bowen,United Kingdom,2016-06-23,10,"✅ Verified Review   Quick weekend break to Madrid and a wonderful experience of KLM. The price was outstanding via a travel website. Ground staff, in Newcastle, Amsterdam and Madrid were  friendly, proactive and efficient. Onboard, cabin staff were possibly the most friendly I've encountered. They couldn't do enough and  never seemed harassed. The seats were more than adequate for 2-3 hours. On the shorter Newcastle sectors we were served a small cake and a drink, and the longer hop to Madrid a hot pizza. Bags were rapidly delivered. They were trialling the new AirFi system on the Madrid route - it wasn't internet access, but streaming entertainment, games and news loaded on which you could access with your wifi device - a great idea.

1223,M Ratrime,Switzerland,2016-06-19,3,"✅ Verified Review   Guayaquil to Lyon via Amsterdam. It has been the first time I flew Business class on KLM and my experience was somehow disappointing mainly because of the seat confort and the disappointing onboard gastronomical experience. Very surspisingly KLM didn't offer on this 11 hour flight a full flat seat which should be a standard today for a 4 star airline. The seat did not completely recline in horizontal position, which made sleeping very difficult and unconfortable. As I complained to the cabin crew, they told me that on various KLM planes there are still the old business class seats (as the one I was in). So, be aware when booking KLM business class because you could experience a very unconfortable night flight without much sleep as I had. I also found the catering experience disappointing. The food quality of the main course was not good, meat was dry and hard. It looked like an economy class meal, just heated up and presented in nice porcelane. I don't like neither the way food was served in business class as flight attendant serve it from the usual economy class trolleys and they still serve you a plastic (I guess it was hard plastic) tray on your table. I found it a real lack of class, KLM should really improve the way they serve this dishes to its guests in the business class. The quality of the coffee served on board was undrinkeable. IFE should be updated to todays standard. Its not user friendly, it looks old and the choice could be better. The staff is very friendly, helpful and caring about its guests, they really like to interact with the passenger. The quality and personnality of KLM flight attendants is probaly what makes KLM so unique. On the short leg from Amsterdam to Guayaquil everything was perfect. A good and tasteful light meal was served and again the staff was very nice and caring. VIP Lounge in Guayaquil is of really poor quality. It looks old, somehow dirty, food choice is not that much great as there is a lot of junk food and you have to pay for alcoholic drinks. However KLM offers a welcome beer or a glass of wine to its passenger which is very appreciated. To summarize I would say that KLM has a very good product for shorthaul and transatlantic economy class whic defeats many of its competitors. However KLM should really speed up in updating its Business Class experience because they do not have a competitive product today.

1255,C Rogers,Hong Kong,2016-04-09,9,"✅ Verified Review   It was such a joy to realize that Bali to Singapore has a KLM route and that business class is so affordable. Captain walked through the business class cabin, looked a little tired and dour, but thought nothing of it. The replacement crew for the Singapore to Amsterdam leg was seated in business class with us, creating a sense of calm and well-resourced and relaxed crew. Seats are the new World Business Class with full flat bed. I didn't use that feature, but definitely clicked it down to about 60 degrees to rest after my third glass of wine. The cabin amenities are great. Good food. Wine selection is incredible. I chose an Argentinian red that really kept its spice at 35,000 feet. Weather looked like we should expect quite a few bumps, but we emerged from 10,000 climbing out of Bali and captain immediately took off the seat belt sign and we cruised along quite smoothly and silky for most of the two hours of level flight. There was one moment of lightning and big hammer tops, but captain and first officer artfully wiggled around them picked up speed and got us into Singapore 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Cockpit messages were brief and not very informative, but that's okay. Professional and cool and was happy that they were clear and gave all the details about arrival and weather. For the most part this is just a lovely luxury shuttle from Bali to Singapore.  I felt relaxed, calm and really satisfied with the service. I've used it three times since I learned about this route. Something about being in those big blue planes makes you feel respected and appreciated. Cabin crew was great and ratio of passenger to flight attendant was good.

1256,Caroline Howe,United Kingdom,2016-04-09,8,"Leeds to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam return, and a very good experience with KLM. We experienced very good customer service from the KLM social media team who resolved an issue with a inexplicable change to our inbound flight very quickly, and they were extremely responsive and helpful. The outbound flight was very good - we found there was more leg room than on a lot of flights. The entertainment was excellent with latest movie releases and good TV system. The staff were efficient and food was fine. With our inbound flight, we received an email 24 hours before the scheduled flight time stating that our flight from KL to Amsterdam was delayed by 4 hours - meaning departing at 0320 and missing our connecting flight from Amsterdam to Leeds - not good. The email stated nothing about what KLM were going to do about this, so we immediately phoned the customer service team. The lady we spoke to very quickly made alternative arrangements for us - by booking us on a completely different flight with Malaysia Airlines to London and then BA from London to Leeds - this solution meant departing at the same time as the original booked flight, and getting back to Leeds slightly earlier than with the original booking - so we were delighted with this solution and the way it was arranged so promptly, with email confirmation coming through straight away. Our only gripe is that fact that the original email was lacking in information and we had to call the customer services team rather than them proactively communicating the alternative option to us.

1272,Kurt Wahlstedt,Sweden,2016-01-24,1,"We were rebooked on this flight from Amsterdam to Lima due to late incoming flight from Stockholm (not KLM fault), so we missed the direct flight to Quito. Our final destination was Quito. In Amsterdam uninterested staff in the transfer area. We could not get our Boarding passes from KLM for the flight from Lima to Quito with TAME, a carrier unknown to us. Our luggage was to be sent directly to Quito with the same flights. Onboard this KLM flight, the cabin was old but the service was OK. Inflight we were told that a person would meet us and help us with the transfer in Lima. Nobody turned up so we had to find the gate for TAME by ourself. That was not open so we went to KLM gate for the returning flight, they knew nothing and were not interested to help us. Eventually we received our Boarding passes at the gate, Economy class as this was the only provided, we were not informed of that. In Quito, were we arrived 7 hours later than our original shedule, our luggage was missing so we made a search with help of a serviceminded person of TAME. The day afterwards we e-mailed KLM and asked them to contact us, they did not. Next day I called them and was told that our luggage was not their business any more but it was up to TAME to find out were it was, they did not intend to follow-up on this. In our hotel we had wonderful staff that called the airport a lot of times and at last, 40 hours after arrival we got it delivered to the hotel (sent from Lima by LAN Chile). The baggage tags were left and we could see that KLM had not redirected the luggage, no wonder that they were not transported properly.

1293,Timothy Wills,United Kingdom,2015-12-17,6,"I have just flown my outward leg of a short break to Hong Kong and have mixed feelings about the journey. I should have left Manchester at 7.50am but the flight was apparently oversold so got bumped to a later flight which was actually listed as the 5.50am earlier flight that was delayed due to a technical problem. Given how empty this later actually flight was, I think it was more the case of me being bumped because I had no status with the airline and KLM simply moved all their Gold and Silver members to my flight. I was supposed to be connecting to a Xiamen Airlines flight (AMS-XMN then XMN-HKG) in AMS but after pointing out that I might make the connection but my baggage definitely wouldn't, the check-in staff agreed and rerouted me. The only way I could get to Hong Kong was to be rebooked onto KLM's direct flight leaving AMS at 5.45pm so had nearly 6 hours layover in Schipol airport. However I was offered 120 euros as compensation so wasn't too depressed and it meant not having to go through the nonsense of immigration at Xiamen despite being a transit passenger. The first leg of the journey (MAN-AMS) left after 9.30am and was not helped by whoever's decision it was to refuel it the plane only once all the passengers were on-board the aircraft. I ask you, this aircraft had been sat empty for at least previous 3 hours! The flight itself was comfortable with decent seat width/pitch plus crew came around with a snack and a drink. Once at AMS, I found the KLM desk and managed to bag an exit row for the 11 hour flight and was delighted until I discovered that the plane (B747-400) had no in-seat USB power in economy unlike the new Xiamen Airlines B787 Dreamliner (which is partly why I booked with Xiamen Airlines in the first place). Boarding was smooth but I was surprised how tight in width the seats were. However once into the flight, I could really understand why many airlines are now ditching the 747 in favour of more modern planes like the the 787 or the A380.  However this KLM flight did have one redeeming feature that was the staff who worked hard the entire flight. The toilets which I was sat close to were cleaned around 4-5 times and crew offered drinks throughout the flight. The food offerings were beef or pasta but by the time they reached me, the pasta had run out and I thought I might be missing out but was brought along a vegetarian Indian style meal which was rather good. As we were descending into Hong Kong, I discovered my seat was broken and could not return to the upright position. One of the crew came around and fixed it but a few minutes later, I could feel it had gone again when I leant back. Given we were so close to landing, I just leant forward instead and kept quiet.

1294,F MacKillop,United Kingdom,2015-12-13,4,"Amsterdam to Hong Kong. This is probably the last time I take KLM, especially for long distance; I only did because I have flying blue and wanted the miles (not that being a FB customer for 10 years has brought me any tangible benefits). KLM is basically a low-cost, Ryanair style carried which pretends to be a proper airline. On this 10-12 hour flight, the seat in front of me was broken, so the guy was basically in my knees, as there is no legroom to start with on these horrid, narrow seats, where you will also jostle for the armrest. Food was simply awful, though less bad coming back from Hong Kong; I know the Netherlands are not a culinary hotspot but they could have made an effort, this was canteen food, everything shrink-wrapped in cellophane and unappetising to say the least. There was also way too little food on the way back, and no advertising of the measly sandwiches available in the galleys (only one choice though, slightly musty Dutch cheese and butter, healthy!). The stewardess seemed reluctant to give them away, does she take them home at the end of service?

This is not a case of his arms resting on the shared arm rest but a case of the arms coming past the armrest into my seat area.

It then took KLM 5 days to deliver the luggage to the place we were staying, two hours away. I called begging for my luggage every day and even offered to come to the airport, but they would not allow it. Our vacation was a long one lasting a full 3 weeks. I got back to Germany and sent paperwork to KLM for 200€ of reimbursement for the clothes and toiletries we needed to buy in the 5 days that the luggage was not delivered. KLM, responded saying that they did not receive the claim within 21 days of the luggage being lost, so they simply did not care and would not do anything for the horrible experience they put my family through.

1325,Linda Evans,United Kingdom,2015-10-17,4,"I agree entirely with the reviewer who was disgruntled with KLM business class between Moscow and Amsterdam. The outward business class flight (Amsterdam-Moscow) had been with Aeroflot, and I was initially disappointed to learn that it wasn't going to be KLM. I shouldn't have been! The Aeroflot experience was really good - we were greeted on arrival with a choice of sparkling white wine, orange juice or water, we were given a proper menu for lunch, and were served with a linen tablecloth and napkin. We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one. There were only two seats per row, which meant they were really wide (though there's nothing separating you from your neighbour). The return, with KLM, was very disappointing. As the other reviewer mentioned, the seats were the standard narrow ones and they'd simply left the middle seat empty. That didn't bother me too much because it was only a medium haul flight, but the level of service and the quality of food was far inferior to Aeroflot. There was a choice of two main hot dishes, but no printed menu, and they had even run out of choice for the gentleman sitting behind me. He complained - justifiably - and whilst the steward serving the meals didn't seem to grasp the significance of a business class passenger not having his choice, the senior attendant did, and she was very apologetic and gave the passenger a gift of two small bottles of champagne to take with him on landing. But the hot meal was served in what was so obviously a microwaveable-type dish, with the foil cover left on it. We had been given a choice of orange juice or water on boarding - but no sparkling wine - and not until all the passengers had boarded (to be fair, the size of the plane would've made it difficult to serve us drinks as the aisles were filled with a stream of boarding passengers, but the absence of sparkling wine was disappointing - and they didn't have the finesse to give us napkins). There was no facility to watch a film. Basically, it was a standard flight that they'd just tried to 'tart up' a bit. With the Aeroflot flight, in contrast, you felt like it was a proper business class flight - we had even got toiletry bags, blankets, and a gift of speciality tea to take with us on landing.

I like the earphones that are supplied, they fit over the ears and are suprisingly comfortable with good audio.

1344,Antonio Gallardo,Sweden,2015-09-19,2,"The KLM change from free luggage to surcharge is a huge mistake, considering that KLM fares are still very high. Their meals onboard are often sub-standard, a cheap sandwich or some unknown mixture of pennes bathing in oil. Their wine is drinkable, but nothing to hang on the tree. Beer offered is their ""national"" Heineken. The seats are adjusted to let as many people sit in the aircraft, which means that people who have long legs or are wider than average can't sit comfortably. Their measure for leg room must be people of 1.70m (5.7f). Yes, you can pay for more legroom. Crew is professional and friendly, no complaints there. Ground crew smashed our luggage beyond repair, most airlines have deals with suitcase shops that a claim is dealt directly. But with KLM you have to send them photos, proof of purchase, a shop's confirmation that it's beyond repair, and ten other things to their HQ. The claim then takes months to be processed.

Everything was clean on boarding, and the crew were welcoming from the start. The plane feels huge inside, although economy can feel a bit cramped in the 3-4-3 layout. I sat in a window seat, which felt far from the aisle. The seats are fairly standard for economy, anyone taller (i.e. more than 5'10"") may feel a bit cramped but the pitch is generally OK.

1366,Eric Decamps,Philippines,2015-08-27,8,"I flew with them for the first time in more than 4 years and once again, it was a nice experience. The price was good so I gave them a chance after being disappointed several times by a major Middle East airline. The flight was good. The food is very light but that's actually a good thing since it's a night flight (people just want to sleep). The service was very quiet and peaceful: light is not bright and crew are not running up and down. For that reason, I will fly with them again if I have a long haul night flight. The in-flight system was defective: the flight tracking system didn't work after we took off from Tapei, which was annoying in such a long flight but the crew was nice so that's fine. KLM now plays with a strong Dutch identity (Dutch snacks, Dutch symbols on the food packages and even on the plastic cups), that really gives a charm that made that flight even better than the one I had 4 years ago.

Excellent food and choice of wines particulary the Dutch white, also the ruby port. The new flatbed seats I found spacious and speedily adjustable. The flight back was OK but lacked the personal and efficient element of outbound which is why I didn't give full marks. Staff friendly but I gained the impression staff just wanted passengers fed and watered as quickly as possible and many things were forgotten, from cognac to museli, everything was a rush. To confirm what others have said, boarding chaotic at Schipol which was nothing to do with security, just the insistence of moving children with associated buggies, people with special requirements and business class all at the same time. BA stagger boarding in that order which is more sensible as one might have priority boarding but you have to climb over everyone else in the waiting area which is so small.

I headed to AMS where I checked in via a self-service kiosk and I dropped my bag at an self-service drop-off point. After that I had to go through security, it was the first time that I used the new central security filter at AMS which opened in June. It went really well. A nice and smooth process. AMS is being renewed, lounge 2 and the Holland boulevard were one big construction site. There were some improvised shops but it wasn’t the AMS standard, I was a bit disappointed that some facilities were not available, for example the Airport Library and the Aiprort’s mini Rijksmuseum. The boarding process took some time but it wasn’t too bad. When we boarded it was a bit chaotic, but the cabin crew were doing their best to get everyone seated as quickly as possible. We had a 2 hr 20 min delay due to a malfunction in a toilet and a late arrival of the aircraft due to delay in LAX. We took off smoothly from Amsterdam Schiphol. Headphones were distributed followed by a non-alcoholic drink and some salted cashew nuts. After that the crew distributed a hot towel. 45 minutes after departure, the first meal service commenced. There 2 options: chicken with rice or Italian penne pasta. I had the chicken and it was delicious. The meal came with a bottle of water and a drink of your choice, beers and wines were available for free as well. After the meal the cabin crew passed by to collect the empty trays and to serve a cup of coffee or tea with a liquor. Afterwards the lights went out to give passengers a chance to take a nap, immigration cards were handed-out. Half through the flight vanilla ice cream and a cup of water was distributed.

No decicated queues for frequent flyers or Comfort Economy. Once onboard, the seats showed their age and lack of comfort on a night flight. In-flight entertainment system is very old, with ancient games, tiny screens, not easy to operate. Choice of films is not too bad. The food was, simply put, inedible. Hardly any drinks service on the night flight - or maybe I missed them as I was trying to sleep. Sleeping is barely possible, as the seats in Comfort Economy are still narrow, even though the legroom is okay. The cabin is noisy. Cabin crew impoite, even rude at times - did not feel welcome. Once in Amsterdam, we learnt that both our connecting flights (to different airports in different countries) had been cancelled. No help from ground staff whatsoever.

We had two hours for the connection in Paris, which was tight since we had to retrieve our luggage and register them again.

Because of chaotic conditions in Corfu (widely understaffed for the first big summer vacation week end since Covid), we departed 2 hours late.

Since I purchased the extra insurance to cover any travel interruption  he told me that their mission was to take us and our luggage to the final destination.

1430,S Kudriavtsev,Netherlands,2022-05-14,2,"Flight started with severely disorganized and chaotic boarding process. We had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight (at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards, but WTH?) The boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight. As a result, the entire passenger queue, already after passing the passes control, has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded. Obviously, no cleaning of the plane has been done - we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats, those were extremely uncomfortable. They did have an average leg space for a low-cost, I'll give them that, but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either. The armrests could only have been raised halfway, so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders (normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without). I've even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats. Now I'm writing this from home with severe back pain that I've experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and I blame the seats. For the reference, the specific plane was PH-HZX. Curiously enough, the first flight (AMS-SVQ) didn't have these issues - the only thing I can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport, but I expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway.

1431,Vincent Percival,United Arab Emirates,2022-05-12,1,"I have never been so offended by a service provider as this airline. First off, does this company even exist, as far as customer service is concerned, apart from over the phone? There is certainly no customer service at their counter at Schiphol airport. I was just told to get in touch by phone. A ticket I had purchased with them allows me to rebook my flight any number of times during a period of one year. The flight was initially booked for December 2021 but had to be rebooked when the Netherlands went into hard lockdown. I could not rebook the flight for the desired date of December 2022 as the airline had no flight schedule in place for the winter 2022 season. I was therefore forced to rebook the ticket to an unwanted date (March 2022). Come March 2022, their schedule was still not out so I had to rebook to another unwanted date (April 2022), so as not to lose the ticket, incurring extra charges on both occasions, all for no purpose. As the (unwanted) flight date drew near, and, with a winter 2022 schedule still not out and no more available dates left to book past April 2022, I contacted the airline to ask for a voucher/credit but was denied one, resulting in the ticket being forfeited. A customer forfeiting a ticket because of administrative issues i.e. being forced to book unwanted dates only to forfeit the ticket? I have a right to a booking, to hold on to that booking, and to rebook my flight to the desired date. None of those rights have been respected. International flights can be booked a year in advance, apparently not in this instance. What do you call it when an airline forces you to book unwanted dates and incur extra charges only to forfeit your ticket. I have a term for it. Let the reader judge. What makes it worse is their agents’ unprofessionalism and/or deliberate evasion of the subject matter. When I asked them for a voucher and pointed out there were no more dates to rebook their responses, included, for example: ""I understand your situation, however, as per company policies we won't be able to offer you a voucher. Our winter season flight will be out towards the end of April. However, once (they mean “since”) the flight is booked for tomorrow, if you do not want to lose the ticket, please change the route and date of your ticket. You can try and change it for October, so you do not have to change it again before the winter season flights are out.” This is just one example of the astonishing drivel I have received as a response. How can I change the flight for October if there are no flights in October, the subject matter being the Dubai-Amsterdam leg? How can I even “change it again (in April I assume) before the winter season flights are out” when there are no more flights dates left to rebook to? And even if there were, just to incur unnecessary costs? Is this deliberate evasion of the topic or lack of knowledge or what? Not only am I unnecessarily out of pocket, I’m without recourse, having contacted every relevant body. Thank you Transavia. I’ve been flying with you annually for the past 7 years.

1444,Ieremias Athanasiadis,Netherlands,2021-05-22,1,"I arrived at checkin at 08.30 with the flight departing at 9.15. The employee receiving me at the waiting line informed me that he can't let me proceed to the check-in desk because it is closed. I objected letting him know that it is 45 minutes before the flight and that there is still time to board the plain. I later found out at the Transavia website that the formal SLA is 40 minutes, so he had no right to deny me entrance on that excuse. I convinced him to let me proceed to the desk. While waiting in front of the desk for a decision there was a lot of back and forth between the employee appearing to be in charge next to the desk and the boarding gate. They finally reached the decision to let me in as I was on time. Upon inspecting my PCR test (as an email on my phone), the employee at the desk clicked on a link directing him to the Dutch government website instead of the attached PDF containing the PCR test. In this confusion his instinctive response was to tell me that Transavia doesn't accept this test, although he wasn't looking at the actual PCR certificate but a government web page. I complained saying that I had used Transavia's services 3 months ago with a PCR test from the same authority. Without any sign of self-doubt or hesitation he informed the person in charge that my PCR was invalid.  I was directed to the help desk and talked to the employee there. She asked how much I paid for my certificate and where I had received it. She then proceeded to acknowledge that my PCR was valid and we went together back to the checkin desk. After, informing the staff that they had bounced me off for no reason 10 minutes ago and that they should have let me in, they reverted back to the argument that I had arrived too late anyway. Of course at that point it was indeed too late. So, I guess from my point of view I arrived 5 min before the checkin formally closes with a valid PCR certificate and was denied a service I had paid for. The worst part is that nobody seemed to bother too much about it let alone utter an apology. They were behaving like it is another day at the office and that it sucks for me but rules are rules. Bouncing off people like that might be ok if we are talking about trains or buses because you can catch the next one.

I tried to do that, but it wouldn’t go through. So I arrived at the Orly airport at 4:00am ready to fly, and when I showed the confirmation of our flight was told “ It’s not your fault. There is no flight to Dublin today. It’s tomorrow. Your boarding pass is correct, but there is no flight. Go to the Transavia counter.” There we were told to call a number to get a refund after 8:00 am. Our phones were not connecting in France, so impossible, and there is no public phone in the airport. And a refund was not what we wanted. We needed a flight to Dublin. So after pleading for help from the Transavia agent she used her personal phone to find us a flight to Dublin that day on AerLingus. We TRULY appreciated her help. Of course this flight cost 5 times what we had paid to Transavia, and also left from Charles DeGaulle airport. So we took a bus there costing an additional €40, and managed to get to our destination in time to spend a night in Dublin and catch a Norwegian flight to the USA the next day. I still have not received any communication from Transavia regarding this change of schedule. It’s like it didn’t happen from their end. That’s not all! As a previous reviewer wrote, the week before our Transavia flight from Dublin to Orly was cancelled due to the controllers strike (understandable) but again no assistance. We ended up flying to Brussels on Ryan Air and trained from there to Paris, once again at great expense. So two for two, and we’ve never boarded a Transavia plane!

Overall a good flight the only thing I was quite unhappy about was that the counter for bagage check in only opened two hours before scheduled departure yet airlines tend to advise us to arrive well in advance (I was at the airport about three hours before the flight was due to leave).,Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Paris Orly,April 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,,4,yes,True,Dublin,Paris Orly,,Positive,0.9442,  flew dublin paris orly quick efficient take minute late arrive time front seat 2f comfortable good leg room board service efficient friendly food drink purchase reasonable price opt pain au chocolat coffee breakfast 4 euros baggage already wait clear immigration slight wait immigration appear handle much well last time pass orly overall good thing quite unhappy counter bagage check open two hour schedule departure yet airline tend advise us arrive well advance airport three hour due leave
1496,A Herbert,France,2018-03-10,3,"Amsterdam to Paris Orly. I have flown the Orly to Amsterdam route on Transavia a number of times, and generally it offers good value for money on a short flight. However, at least 1 out of 4 times there is a inexplicable delay and their logistics tend to be non-existent when this happens. For the morning Amsterdam to Orly flight on 8 March, flight was delayed at first for 30 minutes, so the gate was moved to a bus-out gate in the basement of Schiphol airport. Counter-intuitively, there was another flight leaving from the same gate at the same time. Of course it was absolute chaos, further delaying the flight. This also meant that there was not enough seating in the gate area, coincidentally the only bathroom was closed for cleaning, and there was no access to food or beverages except for a vending machine requiring coins. If you value your time and a basic level of comfort, I would avoid this airline if possible. It’s a fine airline when everything goes as planned, but extremely poorly managed when there is any type of problem, and quite often there is a problem.",Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Paris Orly,March 2018,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3,no,True,Amsterdam,Paris Orly,,Negative,-0.5688,  amsterdam paris orly fly orly amsterdam route number time generally offer good value money short however least 1 4 time inexplicable delay logistics tend happen morning amsterdam orly 8 march delay first 30 minute gate move gate basement schiphol airport another leave gate time course absolute chaos delay meant enough seating gate area coincidentally bathroom close clean access food beverage except vend machine require coin value time basic level comfort avoid possible fine everything go plan extremely poorly manage type problem quite often problem

1498,Willem Frederik Paul,Netherlands,2018-02-15,3,"Alicante to Amsterdam. I have to say this is just a terrible airline. From the moment we arrived at the airport in Alicante to the moment we left the airport in Amsterdam everything went wrong. There was a 100 meter queue at the checkin desk with only one person working. We contacted transavia about this and they said they were unable to help us. Then the boarding took extremely long, the plane was fully booked and there was no space to fit bags in the overhead compartents. As a result, the crew asked people to check their bags as we entered the airplane. The whole process took very long. The seats were extremely small, much smaller than any economy i've flown with. Then to top it all off, it took at least an hour for our luggage to arrive at the baggage claim.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Alicante to Amsterdam,February 2018,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Alicante,Amsterdam,,Negative,-0.0352,  alicante amsterdam say terrible moment arrive airport alicante moment leave airport amsterdam everything go wrong 100 meter queue checkin desk one person work contact say unable help us board take extremely long fully book space fit bag overhead compartents result crew ask people check bag enter airplane whole process take long seats extremely small much small economy flown top take least hour luggage arrive baggage claim
1499,Catherine James,United Arab Emirates,2018-02-05,10,"I flew Transavia in November 2016 and I forgot to add my review. Better late than never! I knew it was a budget airline and I knew it was going to be a long flight. Dubai isn't exactly close to The Netherlands. I was very happily surprised. The staff were friendly, the plane left on time. We were told we may stop over to refuel halfway there but we didn't need to. We landed on time and without any issues. Yes you need to pay for your food and drink and yes the trolleys take a while to get to you if your at the back of the plane. But as long as you are prepared for the wait and maybe bring a bottle of water on board and a sandwich, packet of crisps, you will be more than fine! I am flying with them again in March 2018 and this time with my boyfriend. This time I'm bringing a shawl and a neck pillow and my laptop so we can watch a bit of TV while we fly because it can be boring without these things. The seats are comfy enough and the overall experience has left me feeling more than happy to fly them again. It was a safe flight (and I'm a terrified flyer by the way). I wont forget to review them again this time - so wait till the end of March and I will add my 2nd review.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Amsterdam,November 2017,2.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,,5,yes,True,Dubai,Amsterdam,,Positive,0.9044,  flew november 2016 forget add review well late never know budget knew go long dubai exactly close netherlands happily surprise staff friendly leave time may stop refuel halfway need landed time without issue yes need pay food drink yes trolley take get back long prepared wait maybe bring bottle water board sandwich packet crisp fine fly march 2018 time boyfriend time bring shawl neck pillow laptop watch bit tv fly bore without thing seat comfy enough overall experience leave feel happy fly safe terrify fly way wont forget review time wait till end march add 2nd review
1500,S Bahele,Spain,2017-12-29,1,"Madrid to Paris. If there is any trouble with your flight, you are left alone at the airport. Transavia has not representation (or so they said) and refused to help travellers or even talk to us. We had a flight from Madrid to Paris on the 14/12 at 15:00, which was announced 2 hours late. We quickly saw it was getting worst, but they then had us wait at the gate, not providing any information. There was no Transavia employees but only the ones from the own airport that would not say anything: ""will we even fly? We don't know."" We were there until 22:00 at night, they said there will be a flight and suddenly it got cancelled. From 13h30 to 22:00 in an airport for nothing. They told us we would have a flight the next day at 14:00. Already 24h lost on your trip, great. Next day, no flight at 14:00, again no information from Transavia, they did not care to come and talk to us. The flight left at 18:30 with a different company no one never heard about, there was no food or drinks inside the plane as it was not supposed to leave. Over 4 hours late on a flight that was scheduled the day before. They gave us a 3,5€ voucher for food that was not even working in Madrid! And refuse to compensate us for the second flight, which was 4 hours late on the scheduled hour. We basically arrived with 27 hours late on the original schedule, getting in Paris at 20:00 on a Friday instead of 17:00 on a Thursday.  Yes they are cheap, but it also comes with these negative sides. I would rather spend a bit more money and not waste my whole holidays for an incompetent, terrible company. Will not recommend to fly with them to anyone.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Paris,December 2017,,,,,1.0,,2,no,True,Madrid,Paris,,Negative,-0.8555,  madrid paris trouble leave alone airport representation say refuse help traveller talk us madrid paris announce 2 hour late quickly saw get bad us wait gate provide information employee one airport say anything fly know night say suddenly get cancelled 13h30 airport nothing us next day already 24h lose trip great next day information care come talk us leave different company one never hear food drink inside suppose leave 4 hour late schedule day give us voucher food work madrid refuse compensate us second 4 hour late schedule hour basically arrive 27 hour late original schedule get paris friday instead thursday yes cheap come negative side rather spend bite money waste whole holiday incompetent terrible company recommend fly anyone
