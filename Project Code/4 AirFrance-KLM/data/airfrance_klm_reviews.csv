0,L Neiman,United States,2023-11-15,1,"Air France lost our three bags, someone was in my seat on the plane. The woman who tried to help us fill out forms about our missing bags could barely use the touch screen, so we had to do it for her completely. We had to wait more than three hours after we got off the plane to get our bags at our destination after they were left in Paris (our layover). The aircraft’s wheels were exceptionally squeaky, and they screeched loudly constantly while we were on the ramp. Also, the food was terrible. It was a sloppy cream cheese and cucumber “sandwich”. It was barely edible. They forced us to check our bags in the first case despite there being plenty of open seats and thus, room to carry our bags onto the plane like normal. They needlessly created the conditions to lose our bags and followed through and succeeded in it.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Rome,November 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,False,Amsterdam,Rome,
1,Derek Northcutt,United States,2023-11-15,2,"Very disappointing and that has become the normal experience with Air France. Poor catering on board, and on a nine-hour flight no one came to offer more drinks. I went to the back to fetch my own but found that the cabin crew had sealed off our compartment (limiting 16 rows to one toilet) with locked curtains, so they can be alone. Upon arrival, there was no wheelchair for me (and this happens all the time at CDG airport). I have an artificial leg and it is difficult for me to walk long distances, yet they have me walk up the boarding bridge to the lobby, then walk outside to catch their van, where it drops you off at another terminals and you have to walk up steps and then an elevator and then a longish walk to where they have their wheelchair staff. If you wish to fly with this group, choose KLM who are efficient, they have wheelchairs available when you arrive, take you to where you want to go. We flew to Bucharest, and there has never been a wheelchair waiting for me so I guess they do not do that there. My last three trips with AF/KLM have resulted in delayed suitcases of up to a week.

4,C Huang,United States,2023-11-09,1,I’ve been on “bad” airlines and even though the amenities may be lacking the customer service was at least decent. This cannot be said for Air France. After struggling to find room to store my luggage I had to squeeze my way up and ask the flight attendant for assistance. She told me “you need to figure that out yourself” along with “I don’t know how to help you”. I kept telling her that I wasn’t able to find bin space and that I needed help moving stuff out of the way (I’m 4’11 I can barely reach the bins) along with lifting my suitcase into a bin but she kept saying “you need to figure it out on your own”.

5,Catalin Alexandru Glavan,Switzerland,2023-11-08,3,"I recently booked a round-trip flight from Zurich to Antananarivo with Air France, and the experience was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, it was a series of mishaps and poor service that left me deeply stressed and unsatisfied. The outbound flight from Zurich was delayed by more than 30 minutes. This delay put us in a precarious situation, and we were forced to rush to catch our connecting flight at Paris CDG. The stress of almost missing our connection was certainly not the ideal way to begin a vacation. On the return journey, the problems persisted. The flight from Antananarivo to Paris CDG experienced another significant delay, causing us to miss our initial connection to Amsterdam. While we were rebooked on a later flight, the flight from Paris CDG to Amsterdam was delayed by 30 minutes. In an attempt to ensure we caught our connection in Amsterdam, we requested assistance from a flight attendant, only to be met with a disrespectful attitude and a dismissive response. Upon arriving in Zurich, the troubles continued as our luggage was nowhere to be found. Three of our bags were stuck in Amsterdam, and one in Paris CDG. We were left waiting for over 2 hours and 30 minutes for our luggage from Amsterdam to arrive in Zurich. This was particularly distressing because two of us had another flight scheduled for the following day and were uncertain whether our luggage would make it in time. As a result, we also missed our train connection from Zurich Airport to Thun. To top it all off, the in-flight meals provided by Air France were subpar at best. On the way to Antananarivo, the tomato salad had a rotten taste, and for a 10-hour flight, the meal options were shockingly limited. On the return journey, the meals were disappointing, with the second meal consisting of bread with some sauce, a cold mini croissant, a jam, and a yogurt. In summary, my experience with Air France on this trip was marred by delays, unhelpful staff, lost luggage, and inadequate in-flight meals.  I expected better service and reliability for the price I paid, and this experience fell far short of those expectations.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Antanarivo to Zurich via Paris,November 2023,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2,no,True,Antanarivo,Zurich,Paris

My most recent was however not a pleasant one. Neither leg of my roundtrip flight was enjoyable and felt like more of a budget airline. We are frequent travelers and book specific seats. we know which seats are not good. a month before they changed planes, and we were forced into seats that we would not have choose as they do not recline as much as the rest of that class. Well, we were stuck and had no other seats to move too. On top of that my seat was broken and the footrest could not be used. So not only did I have a seat that did not recline like the rest now I had a broken footrest. The only option was to move to a middle seat away from my family and sit by strangers. I might have just sat in economy because the premium was really not premium. The staff is amazing as always and so very nice, but wow the food was absolutely horrific on both flights.

We boarded on time at 3.30pm for a 4.05pm departure from BEY to CDG, and shortly after pushing back we were informed of a technical problem. We returned to the gate and were told one hour later that it was fixed. However shortly after pushing back again, the pilot announced the problem was still not fixed and that the plane's radar was out of order. We were then offered to fly to Athens as the weather there was good and ""didn't require a radar"". Another AF flight would then take us to Paris. However half the passengers decided to leave the plane. I decided to stay but after more than 5 hours, we were still stuck in the plane with no food or drink served. Then the pilot said the flight was canceled because the weather had changed! A hostess started shouting at us with conflicting instructions about disembarking and then returning to our seats - a complete chaos with children crying. After disembarking it was a total mess a no one knew on which flight they would be rebooked. We ended being sent to a cheap hotel at midnight. It was impossible to get any help from AF's call center as it is based in North Africa and their totally useless staff were not even able to provide accurate information (they said there was no flight before 2 days later while I managed to get a booking the next day by talking directly to the airport staff).

A small bag with candies and fruit juice was served before landing, unlike some full service carriers who serve two full hot meals on such long flights. No power socket, only USB plugs - quite unacceptable for Premium Economy. No wifi.

14,J Borgen,United States,2023-10-14,3,"Strike among air controllers in Paris caused particular problems due to delays. Sitting in an Air France plane waiting during delayed boarding is torture given the NOISE that is played. Made by a 12 year old who knows three chords and got his hands on a synthesizer? Awful. Same mind numbing noise if you call AF. Flying in “comfort” Premium Economy for $3,660 RT is horrendously overpriced given the food and lack of attention. This was a fairly common Business Class fare. Except for a seat that is less uncomfortable than in economy and a pouch with a toothbrush etc., there is nothing to justify the price difference. Dinners were served, both ways, with a main dish in a rectangular box hidden in mashed potatoes. Return flight I chose duck. Sounds nice, right? More like pre- chewed something mixed with, or hidden underneath, mashed potatoes. On neither flight (to and from Paris) did anybody stop to ask if I would like another wine or more water. No drinks before dinner. Nothing to differentiate this “Premium class” from economy. Stewards steamed backwards with cart returning from economy without so much as looking sideways to quickly reach the sanctity of the galley between business class and the Premium Economy. You will not get any kind of service or attention that differentiates you from those in economy seats. It may be Air France’s intention that there should be a difference, but I have on my three flights with AF this year seen none of it! None. While there are three or four bathrooms provided for business class in front of you, you will in the Premium section have longest walk to a bathroom of any passenger onboard. True! As I saw that many passengers (especially couples) are in their 60s and 70s this is another reason this Premium section does not warrant its price. The walk back through the economy section in the dark with pillows, blankets, and feet in the way is no fun. In reaching the very back of the plane there were three thin brown sandwiches in a large box waiting, together with a few chewable candies also in a large box and two stewardesses far less interested in engaging with a passenger than in talking among themselves. And it is especially here that KLM has a leg up on Air France. More often, but not always, do KLM personnel seem more friendly and engaging. With reference to my observations in the above, try KLM premium and compare for yourself. The Air France lounge is nice, but if given the opportunity, check out KLM’s main lounge in Amsterdam. Also very nice. Conclusion, suffer economy for 8.5 to 10.5 hours and treat yourself (with the significant amount of money not wasted) to a nicer hotel and great and expensive meal upon arrival! And, on this particular flight, you will guaranteed be closer to bathroom if you book an economy seat! I personally prefer KLM, but when I need a flight on short notice it is usually AF that have tickets. For me, a Delta flight involves a stopover in the US, and is typically more expensive to boot.",Airbus,Business,Premium Economy,Oslo to Houston via Paris,October 2023,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,,1,no,False,Oslo,Houston,Paris

18,R Habasi,Morocco,2023-10-02,1,"Disappointing Business Class Experience on Air France. My wife and I recently flew with Air France in business class from Rabat to Manchester, with a connecting flight in Paris. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience that did not meet our expectations. On September 28, we boarded our flight from Rabat to Paris. The business class seats were barely an upgrade from economy, with limited recline and lacking amenities. The meal service was lacking - a small cold pasta salad and no appetizer or dessert. Upon arriving at CDG, there was no priority boarding or fast track security for business class passengers. We waited in a long queue for 35 minutes to board our connecting flight to Manchester. Again, the business class meal was mediocre - a small cold sandwich. On our return journey on October 1, we decided to fly economy class. Our flight from Manchester departed 15 minutes late. We were anxious about missing our connection in Paris due to the delay. The food was disappointing. Our flight landed in Paris 25 minutes late, giving us under 40 minutes to catch our connection to Rabat. We rushed through the airport and reached the gate just in time. However, upon landing in Rabat, we were informed that our checked luggage had been left behind in Paris. We had to return to the airport at 11:30pm when Air France sent the bags on a later flight. Overall, Air France's subpar seats, lack of amenities, mediocre food, and mismanaged baggage handling made this a terrible experience.

21,H Martin,United Kingdom,2023-09-21,1,"The quality of Air France is disgraceful to the point I won't fly any sky alliance flights again. We were flying back to Johannesburg for our wedding and so wanted the experience to be slightly more special. Paid for an upgrade to business class at the airport for Paris to JHB. Firstly, we received better drinks service in economy coming back than going out in business class. After our boarding drink was poured and we were in the air I asked if I could get a drink, twice, to once be told they would be with me soon, and when we were still ignored my partner then asked for a whiskey and he was told you can wait till after dinner. I understand that if you have been drinking prior to your flight and appear intoxicated, then you are not going to be served. However, we had just gotten off of our flight from Edinburgh to Paris which we had not drunk on. This flight was delayed. We were unable to make use of any of the time in the airport lounge which had been included in our flight upgrade, so hadn't had anything to drink during our time through CDG either.  Also, this doesn't even include WiFi. Secondly, at check in we were unable to upgrade on our return as the flight was full. When I discussed the delay on our last flight and our missed opportunity to utilise the lounge included with our previous upgrade she shrugged and said she didn't know and I should ask someone else. The food was bad with no in flight options provided. Only veggie, with both main and side vegetables overcooked. There is zero quality for the economy class customer experience which is ironic considering they were the most expensive of the three airline options between us and our guests who either flew British Airways or Qatar. We paid (not including our upgrade) £650 per adult return in comparison to £600 for BA and £500 for Qatar (all EDI to JHB). And again, despite being the most expensive, this included no checked baggage. Finally, my decision to never fly Sky Team again was cemented when I realised that I had not packed my toothpaste into my hand luggage on the economy fight back, so asked a stewardess if I could please have some to brush my teeth. Initially she told me they don't carry any toothpaste on board. When I didn't walk away she finally agreed that yes they do have toothpaste on board in the Business class flight bags but these are only for business class.

They give during the 10 hours 40 minutes flight less than a liter of water or any other kind of fluid and when you ask they give you paper mini cups of water. And you almost have to beg them. They only give two times something to eat. They last food round what's less than an hour and a half before landing of the flight so you have no time to eat properly because they barely give you your food and they already come to pick it up.

I was so happy to see all 3 agents working in ""Priority check in"" free. No customers to serve. I approached one agent, she asked to see my ticket which I showed her. I told her I want to upgrade. She replied, with a stern look, and said ""come back at 7"". The time was 6.15 pm. She would not listen to anything I said thereafter ignoring me as though I did not exist. Another client arrived who was scheduled on an earlier flight, she allowed him to check in an extra luggage for free. I responded by saying that was such a nice gesture on her behalf, and it would be appreciated if that kindness spread to others like me....to please give me a solution. No response. I went to the next agent who was a little more helpful and told me to try the upgrade on the machine. (Even though there were no other customers to serve). I went to the self-operated check in machine and succeed to find the seats I wanted but it would not accept any credit card and redirected me to the counter. I went back, again all 3 agents were free. They said they cannot help. I became angry. Another client came with the same situation. Yet that client had already her business class tickets. She was treated the same way. She said she had “never” seen such service. Ok now its 7pm. I am waiting to enter priority check in-no one is there to serve the clients! The economy class is whizzing by, the ones in “Priority are waiting to be served. I approach the second agent I see walking by to ask her what is going on? Clearly, I was very upset. Rather than answer me she threatens to call security! Are you for real? She claims not to like my “tone”! Question: Air France: Why are you putting agents such as these in “Priority” check in? Please I need to understand! I am on a seven-week European vacation with my husband. I was so happy and then this? Do your clients happiness matter to you? Finally, I wanted their names which they completely refused to give, therefore I photographed them so that you can identify these rude agents and retrain their customer care service skills, or better yet give them a job that they do not have to deal with people.

A few weeks before my flight, I called Air France to check on the seating and meal arrangements for my daughter to ensure everything is confirmed. The 2nd time I called Air France was the day before my flight to make sure again if the seating and meals were confirmed. Both occasions, I was given the assurance that my daughter's child meal was confirmed and for seating, it is a priority she is in the appropriate seat next to me. During the flight, the attendant came to me and said the child meal was not booked when I did it 2 times. The 2nd issue is my seat was faulty.  I only realized when I was extending the seat, that it jammed and couldn't become a bed. I got off to check and saw my daughter's foot was stuck in this big gap as you see in the picture, by the metal piece stretching across the seat. This piece was visible and the cushion was falling off. I called the attendant and she quickly informed the chief steward who came and pulled the cushion away to seal it back to cover the metal piece.  Throughout the flight, the cushion kept sliding and I had to get off the seat to refit the cushion. Before landing, I couldn't fully recline the seat back to original position because of this big issue. The attendant had to put in a lot of strength to ensure the cushions fit correctly while reclining the seat. Finally it went back to original position but the belt was stuck and I couldn't pull it to secure myself for the landing. I had to sit on my daughter's seat with her on my lap for the landing.

The airplane has been in service for 24 years, but extremely well-kept. We had an hour delay due to a technical issue with one of the navigation instruments however Air France allowed us to stay in the terminal and not on the plane, something that I extremely appreciate. I was very disappointed, however, with fellow business class passengers for giving the crew a hard time because we were late due to the fact that they were trying to fix one of the navigational instruments. Really? You get upset because the delay is a safety issue that they are trying to fix before we take off on a 9 hour flight? Thank you Air France for ensuring that safety came first. I would have gladly waited as long as I had to! Once up in the air, the business class service was nothing short of stellar, the meals were all gourmet by a three star, Michelin Chef, the in-flight crew was warm, welcoming, personable, and genuine. I have to say that after this experience, the business class product on Air France for me, comes in at number 2. Qatar obviously still holds the 1st place for me. This airplane had been upgraded to the new business class configurations 1-2-1. I had a window seat (7A) and even though overall, I am not a big fan of the new “business class pods” industry wide, the seat was very comfortable with plenty of storage, and the entertainment options were very good.

55,P Jackson,United States,2023-07-16,1,"Air France is a terrible airline with deceptive advertising and unresponsive customer service. We remain without fair compensation ($100 offered off a future flight). They made a significant change to my flight itinerary that I deem as an unfair or deceptive practice. The departing inflight entertainment service did not work for all three passengers. We were not informed until the flight was in the air, or we would have re-booked with a proper flight. Furthermore, I purchased these tickets with the promise that we would be served the menu prepared by Chef Mashama Bailey (our co-chef through the James Beard Foundation), but I received horrid food that was still frozen, not her menu or as advertised. Additionally, the staff lied numerous times when questioned if the food was vegetarian, they said yes – only to come back and inform me that they served eggs with chicken. We are strict vegetarians, which caused harm. On the return flight from Paris to JFK, again, I purchased the beauty of an Air France flight with all of its luxury and had a significant change of my flight itinerary that I deem unfair or deceptive practice to a Delta Flight. This flight lacked the services, food by Chef Mashama Bailey (or the Delta Business Class menu – we were served the economy class menu), wine, airplane, and staff that was purchased. The food, wine, flight accommodations, and staff were significant changes to the flight itinerary. This was terrible!

56,Leonardo Cunha,Germany,2023-07-09,1,"I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent flight experience with Air France. Unfortunately, my trip was marked by a significant delay, inadequate accommodations, and disproportionate treatment regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. First and foremost, my flight experienced a 2-hour delay, which resulted in a missed connecting flight at CDG to AJA and disrupted my plans. The lack of effective communication and frequent updates on the flight status only exacerbated my frustration and discomfort throughout the waiting period. Furthermore, the accommodations provided by Air France were extremely disappointing. The hotel where I was accommodated was of inferior quality, with poor conditions and lack of air conditioning. The unbearable heat made my stay even more unsatisfactory and affected my rest before continuing with the journey. Lastly, I would like to mention the excessively strict attitude regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. I was surprised by a severe reprimand from the airline staff due to just 700 grams over the limit in my carry-on bag, even though it was the same bag I boarded with in MUC. This disproportionate approach and disrespectful treatment left me extremely disappointed with the service provided. As a customer, I expected a comfortable and professional flight experience, but unfortunately, Air France did not meet my expectations. I request that you review your customer service policies with the aim of preventing other passengers from going through similar experiences in the future. As a result of this negative experience, I categorically state that I do not intend to fly with Air France again. I hope that this situation will be treated seriously, and appropriate measures will be taken to remedy the situation.",,Business,Premium Economy,Munich to Ajaccio via Paris,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Munich,Ajaccio,Paris

59,Pieter Scholtz,South Africa,2023-07-03,1,"I have flown with Air France regularly because it is the only direct flight from South Africa to France where I study. I have always been surprised by how poor the food and service are on the route I take, but my last trip took Air France's utter disregard for passengers to a new level. After the plane was in Johannesburg for a whole day (available to be inspected and to make sure that everything on the plane was working) the flight got cancelled when we were already all boarded and ready to go when the pilot announced an issue with the air conditioning system. Even though I believe this was ridiculous already given all the time they had to check the plane, the worst was yet to come. The pilot gave a very unsympathetic announcement after we were sitting on the plane for two hours already that the flight is cancelled. Nothing else. The cabin crew advised us that the ground crew will assist us. Except that there were no ground crew when we got off the plane. One lady behind an obscure desk had no idea what was going on and a gent with her merely said to all the passengers that they should sort themselves out with accommodation, food and travel to the accommodation and then claim back. If all of this was already ridiculous, the worse was yet to come: trying to process a claim is a nightmare! Air France booked me on another flight 3 days later - without any correspondence with me. If I had taken this flight I would not have been able to graduate this year as I would've missed a key class in my studies. I urgently had to book another flight via Kenya to get to France in time for my classes. The whole process was so badly done that it proofed impossible to cancel the substitute flight without cancelling my return flight as well. There was no way of contacting anybody at Air France to assist in cancelling the replacement flight, but not cancel the return flight. No way to phone or e-mail. Air France doesn't even have an office area in Johannesburg where one can ask for assistance. The website is terrible and the AI used clearly doesn't cope with anything that is not stock standard. I am still struggling to try and process my claim. I have still not managed to connect with anybody at Air France that can assist to sort out the cancelling of the replacement flight. They claim you can connect with them on Messenger or Twitter, but don't be fooled, the AI chat bot doesn't work well and the supposed operators don't contact you as promised by the chat bot. Even the African Airlines are better than Air France. The customer service on Air France is terrible and it is clear they have no intent of actually providing a decent customer experience. Not on the plane, on the ground, on their website or in Charles de Gaulle airport.

62,S Nemec,Czech Republic,2023-06-26,1,"Absolutely terrible experience with this airline. I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don’t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don’t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it’s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company.

If you go over even 2kg, as in my case, you cannot pay for extra weight. You have to pay 60 euros for hold baggage, and that means that you have to use the machine and then hold the line to load the hold baggage. (Ironically, since my bag was 10kg, less than 12kg, they asked me if I wanted to carry it to the check in). The line got very long, between the weighting line, the hold line, and the check in line, and I almost lost the boarding time. They could just let me pay for my 2 kg extra on the place, and it would have been a normal process.

65,vincent pace,United States,2023-06-19,2,"First a comment about Premium Economy on Air France. It's a joke. I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a ""Property Irregularity Report."" Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags.

The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges.

Took for ever to get a cup of mint tea after the ‘dinner’ service as all bar one of the crew disappeared.

We were greeted by enthusiastic cabin crew and shown to our seats. I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle – especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline.

When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ‘It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in’.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed.

I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted.

Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""?

After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me. The nightmare continued in CDG when I was told I was not in Air France systems, so I cannot fly to LIS. However, the lady at CDG counter immediately escalated and resolved the situation.

At both stations it didn’t take me more than 3 minutes with zero queuing time. At the same time queuing to normal check in desks would have taken good 20 minutes (also quite bearable if you arrive on time). My first flight was delayed by 1 hour. The delay was managed perfectly. Push notification and email on the mobile phone with new estimated boarding time and gate number, instant update of the boarding pass via app and proper announcement at the gate. Inflight information on missed and rescheduled connections was sufficient and clear. In the air they have managed to serve small snack with round if drinks (tea, coffee, soda, beer, wine). I purchased inflight internet access. The price was ok, speed was fine for browsing websites. If you need just messaging you can get a free plan for the whole duration of your flight.

I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result.

After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"".

145,L Karson,United States,2022-08-09,6,"We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back.

We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags.

We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address.

149,Y Burns,Canada,2022-08-02,1,"Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir.

151,A Marler,Germany,2022-08-01,1,"During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached.

The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you.

I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter). Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF.

176,C Barker,United States,2022-06-26,1,"My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety.

We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them.

Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong.

202,George Howard,France,2023-11-12,2,"My experience was a nightmare. After having a poor experience, some years ago, I decided to give KLM another chance. My first flight was in July from Paris to Manila via Amsterdam. It was “OK,” but nothing to write home about. In August I was traveling to Athens with my family when a flight was changed and I was shuffled to KLM in order to be able to connect with an ongoing flight to a Greek island from Athens. On boarding in Paris, we were told that my granddaughter’s infant seat could be used on the plane. However, when we got to the plane, the infant seat was basically seized and we were told that it had been gate checked. It was not. It did not arrive in Athens for three weeks. Moreover, the other five suitcases that we had checked did not arrive either. It was exasperating, because we had rented a large space and were expecting seven other people to join us the following day on the island. Although I realize that “it is what it is,” the baggage experience with KLM was crushing, really depressing. Although we were late for our connection to the Greek island because of the lost baggage, which required filing immediate claims, KLM refused to cover any expenses of our overnight stay at a hotel. After we arrived on the island of the following day, which required buying five new tickets, the telephone numbers and email address provided by KLM to check our baggage never answered one single inquiry, and there were many – more than 10. We finally found the baggage ourselves, because my son was traveling with an Apple AirTag. However, we could not inform KLM of that because no one was answering either phone or email. We finally received five of the suitcases on the fourth day of our trip, and the infant seat on the last day of the trip, weeks later. If there had been even the slightest caring message, or concerned response from KLM, I would not be writing this review, but throughout, the KLM response was shameful.

Swissport rarely answer their support phone line and never respond to emails sent to their support team. Over a three week period I attempted to contact them over 20 occasions, having received 3 responses. Impossible and frustrating. After 31 days the luggage was considered lost and I was told by Swissport that they would no longer help me find our luggage. I was told to raise the problem with KLM. The nightmare continued KLM as you try to engage with a support representative. Eventually when KLM are ready to engage with you, you will get to communicate with a support person and progress is made.

I have previously had good experiences with KLM and it's usually my airline of choice to travel to Mexico from Europe. However this last trip was simply a nightmare. After only being informed of delay 1.5 hrs before departure (even though all flights had already had delays that day), I of course would miss my connecting flight to Mexico so I called the customer service line to help me find a solution, they first simply told me that there were no more flights to Mexico so there was nothing they could do. After spending 54min on hold they finally offered to re route me through a BA flight leaving later that night. The purpose of my travel was already ruined and I would be missing the event I was traveling for but I accepted this as the only option of still making my trip. 3 hours before the BA flight was set to depart the flight was cancelled without reason provided. When speaking again to the re-booking agent he said he understood he would cancel my booking at this stage and just claim a refund for me, I continuously asked on the phone if I would get a full refund since the flight delays and cancellations were not on my behalf and I had not taken any of my flights, which he assured me should be the case and I should expect a refund for all of the flights. A few days later I received a refund only for tax and government fees (about 10% of total ticket cost) claiming that I had voluntarily cancelled my flight which is so wrong! Since then I have tried multiple times to speak with a customer representative to understand the policy and situation, this has been impossible! Website is constantly malfunctioning and customer service lines just hang up the line! It is so disappointing and has turned me from a loyal customer to never wanting to travel with KLM ever again.

220,Théo Denys,Belgium,2023-09-16,8,"I took a Flight with KLM from Amsterdam to Shanghai. Here’s how it went. Price: 800€ Return Class: Economy ## 1) Boarding I started my journey from Brussels. After a couple of minutes looking for the KLM desk at the Brussels Train Station, I finally found it. Although the online check-in didn't work, the physical check-in was seamless as it only took 5 minutes. I then took the Thalys train to Amsterdam. My train arrived late so I had only 1h45 before take-off. For some reason I had Priority, so it sped the process a bit. After security check (with automatic passport check w/ facial recognition!), I went to the boarding deck. I still had to wait 20 minutes. Then I could finally board. ## 2) Plane experience For this let's just do a positive-neutral-negative points list **The good** - Free *Wi-Fi* allows messaging with limited image sharing. *Large screen* with movies, a dozen games, music, video destination guides and even a Google Earth tool ! *Food* was great. Quality-wise is what you would except whit pre-cooked meals. (I had raviolis, with a slice of bread, actual cheese, olives and Piment stuffed with some kind of cheese.) Quantity-wise I found it satisfying. I had one meal at around 6:30 pm EU time (GMT+1) and one at around 2:00 pm or 8:00 pm on the local schedule. *Toilets*: clean, spacy, often available. **Meh** - *Leg-room* was sufficient but getting in and out was really an hassle. (I'm 1m89). Being in the middle, I always had trouble to get to my seat. *Sleep quality*: First, I wished we could move the table up and down. The only way I can sleep is putting my head on a table. But since there's no place to stretch, I have to put it around my chest level. I had to pile things up. Secondly, I wished the screen could be locked. So you don't power it on when you rest on it. **The bad** - *Provided earbuds quality:* I didn't expected them to be that bad. I'm not asking more than those school/ office headsets or quality of a 100$ smartphone. But with those while music was logically not possible (that's ok) but even listening to movies was painful: either bump up sound to uncomfortable level or miss parts of dialogues. Sparse subtitles availability didn't helped. Since airline loves charging extras, why not one for ""quality"" earbuds? Poor *decline* ability. Couldn't fall asleep on those. Not much informational *media* offerings. While a handful of podcasts were offered, there very few episodes of those. Additionally, there is no (virtual) newspaper platform. ## Conclusion : I honestly think for the price it's not that. But it's my first intercontinental and my third flight overall, so my judgement doesn't worth much.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Shanghai via Amsterdam,September 2023,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,True,Brussels,Shanghai,Amsterdam

223,Arthur Anthony Williams,United Kingdom,2023-09-03,1,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with my recent experience with KLM Airlines, specifically concerning flight KL1527 on August 28, 2023. This ordeal has left me deeply unsatisfied and dissuaded from ever considering KLM as a viable airline option in the future. On the mentioned date, I received a text notification informing me of flight cancellations, which led me to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Upon arrival, I was met with the bewildering situation where the KLM customer service desk was closed, leaving passengers in the lurch. Instead of providing proper assistance, KLM staff merely offered basic advice and handed out disruption information letters. According to the initial information provided by KLM staff, my flight was cancelled due to UK traffic control problems. I was instructed to book accommodation on my own and assured that my flight would be rebooked within an hour. Following their advice, I made the necessary arrangements for a room and returned to the city centre via train. However, to my dismay, I did not receive any rebooking notification within the promised timeframe. After waiting in vain, I decided to contact KLM customer care, only to be put on hold for an excruciating 40 minutes. When someone finally answered, they abruptly cut off the call, displaying a complete disregard for the passengers' concerns. I had no choice but to call back, and to my utter disbelief, I was informed that my flight was, in fact, operational, contradicting the previous information given by KLM staff. This inconsistency resulted in a mad scramble to return to the airport and barely make it in time for my flight. Furthermore, despite numerous attempts, I have not received any response from KLM's customer complaints department. To make matters worse, when I revisited the KLM customer service desk at the airport, I encountered an extremely unprofessional and rude agent. He displayed a dismissive attitude and attempted to evade responsibility by suggesting that my flight must have been cancelled at the time, which contradicted the information initially provided by KLM staff. His behaviour was unacceptable. This entire experience has demonstrated an astonishing lack of communication and organizational competence on KLM's part. It is disheartening that an airline with such a long history of operation would fail so miserably in providing essential customer care and accurate information during a crisis. In comparison to budget airlines like Ryanair and easyJet, KLM's performance during this situation was abysmal. In conclusion, I am deeply dissatisfied with KLM Airlines and will never consider flying with them again. The ordeal I endured, along with the lack of proper communication and professionalism, has left a lasting negative impression.

We boarded KL695 on the 23rd June from Amsterdam to Toronto and arrived with one of our checked in baggages missing since then.

The timeline of events include our flight being cancelled and rescheduled, unavailable business class upgrade on the rebooked flight, unexplained loss of checked in baggage, several trips to Toronto airport office only to receive lack of empathy and disdain. Some other passengers also mentioned same experience. I believe KLM does no due diligence to trace missing baggages and feels neither remorse nor accountability for inflicting emotional distress and financial loss as a result of people’s personal properties.

My booking information and passport were both checked and I was informed that I wasn’t even on the flight and that she could do nothing about it, I was told to go to the immigration and check with them. The person at the immigration office was nice, he informed me that I could go to the other KLM counter and they would help me with my boarding pass. I was greeted with the same unprofessional, rude, unhelpful and unknowledgeable KLM counter staff lady with major attitude, I was told I would have to take a number and wait. What would’ve happened if I had an earlier flight with less time to wait?! And that’s what I asked her - she ignored the question and looked the other way. I asked another counter staff if there was a way if she could check about my baggage being put on the plane while I waited to speak to someone about my boarding pass. She said I have to wait my turn. I did not ask her for any special treatment, I just asked her if she could check my baggage tag on the computer since she wasn’t doing anything. Luckily, my flight KL1407 was in a few hours, so it was OK for me to wait. I finally got my boarding pass. I had to change airlines to go to France, I again requested another KLM staff to check my baggage tag to make sure that my bag would be put in the airplane. She said it wasn’t necessary, and she was sure my baggage would be in the plane. She didn’t bother to check the computer to make sure that my baggage would be in that plane. I waited for another 30 minutes and went back to get somebody else to check if my baggage was on the flight. A Male staff on KLM counter checked on the computer saying it was already in the plane and that it would get to the destination along with me. Fast forward to me reaching Montpellier Airport. My baggage did not arrive as promised. Air France office Montpellier, the lady told me my baggage wasn’t on the plane and a claim report had to be made to solve the issue.

It felt as my hands could only go on the table or that I would need to cross them, in order not to touch the other person. Also seats were lacking padding, they were pretty thin.

Long haul entertainment is extremely limited. Bring your own device and streaming service. They have little on offer and any tv series are never from the beginning. What's the point in starting a new show you've not seen before on Season 4, Episode 8? Flights are nearly always delayed (again I fly with them almost every weekend). Almost without fail.

However, they're second lounge for non Schengen is very good and praise where praise is due. I just wish they'd stop discrimination against people with food allergies.

But 5 months after purchasing tickets I received an e-mail from KLM with totally new flights schedule that devasted my original plan, hotel reservations, date of return etc. But, ok, it was still in advance and I rearranged all the things including the newly appeared overnight stay in Amsterdam on way back to Zagreb. On the very beginning of our trip at flight from Zagreb to Bergen one of our bags was lost so we spend the first day in Bergen without our warm clothing. But real horror is coming at our way back from Bergen to Zagreb via Amsterdam. On March 17, 2023. we were supposed to arrive from Tromso to Bergen by Wideroe flight at 12:40, and then continue to Amsterdam by KLM flight at 14:20. We were (online) check-in for flight from Bergen to Amsterdam. Flight from Tromso was slightly delayed (for 30 minutes) but still more than an hour before departure of KLM flight. While waiting for baggage I immediately try to contact KLM agent at Bergen airport to ask for advice how to continue our trip but there was literally nobody from KLM to help us, only automatic check-in machines and ""people-less"" baggage drop-in counters. It was 60 minutes before departure of KLM flight from Bergen to Amsterdam. After baggage was delivered we try to check in for Bergen but automatic check-in machine rejected our tickets, although I made on-line check in 30 hours in advance. I was continuously trying to contact KLM service desk at +47 22 64 37 52 and by WhatsApp to get help or advice, but was waiting in the queue and connected to agent only at 14:19. Suggestion was to contact KLM agent at Bergen airport, but there was no / any KLM agent at Bergen airport at that time.

Alternative was to stay and wait (for what?) at Bergen airport… After returning from the trip, calvary with KLM Customer Care Service, is continuing… After tens of repeated messages and inquiries and 2 months, I manage to get refund for overnight stay in Amsterdam and small 'compensation' for lost baggage, but no chance to resolve issue with ""no help, no service, no agent"" at Bergen airport and forcing me to buy new, extra expensive tickets for the flight that we already had tickets and were check-in. ""Customer care agents"" replied to my web form inquiries and claims (replied only from time to time) that they are not authorized to ""interfere with decisions of other department""  and just give general ""psychological"" help, express ""general understanding and regret"", but not solving the issue.

257,Adrian Pritchard,United Kingdom,2023-06-26,9,"I'm a big KLM fan so my review is slightly biased. I'm probably unusual in that I actually enjoy an 11 hour flight with them-even if squashed into Economy. This was a full flight, 425 passengers, all expecting to be fed, watered and presumably pampered, down at the other end of the plane. The crew dealt with the vast numbers of people well. KLM staff are generally pretty friendly and this flight was no exception. One massive plus point I've noticed with KLM over the years is they match your formality level. I'm quite relaxed and the crew match that by calling me by my first name etc. Food was adequate for such a long flight. There was a main meal not long after take off followed by a mid-flight snack and a sandwich just before landing. The beverage trolley was wheeled out a few times. Usual tiny airline food portions however but was quite tasty-aside from a horrible coconut type dessert thing. KLM give bottled water instead of those weird plastic pots with the foil lid that guarantee you will drench the passenger sat on your lap in Economy. This is good. IFE with KLM is always slightly disappointing. Yes, there's a lot to choose from but the vast majority is American rubbish! Why the fixation with US content?? You're a Dutch airline. Show some European solidarity. I can't be the only one who doesn't want Americans screaming at me for an 11 hour flight-if I did, I'd fly Delta!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Johannesburg via Amsterdam,June 2023,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,5,yes,True,London,Johannesburg,Amsterdam

What followed next showed an airline that was not only trying to nickel and dime its passengers at every opportunity, but also had no clue what the rest of the industry was doing! On the day of my departure, I received an email informing me that my flight was cancelled and that I would be rebooked on a different flight soon. When I saw the message displayed an option to change flight or request refund, I followed the link. Then I realized KLM would charge me extra to change my flight. How ridiculous! You cancelled my flight and asked me to pay more to make a change! When I called the service center, I was told that the flight was not canceled and everything was on schedule. So I went a ahead and checked in online. But when I arrived at the airport (LCY) the next day, the billboard showed my flight was indeed cancelled! And I had been rebooked to al later flight. On the day of my return, my flight was delayed. So I wanted to catch an earlier flight at the airport. And I had to do this at a service center where there was a long line. My Sky priority status made no difference, although KLM displayed two queues--Sky priority and General Boarding. I took my number and waited, and waited. 30 minutes later the line hardly moved. So I decided to give it a try at the gate. When I reached a KLM gate, I was told I would have to pay a fee to change to another flight. How ridiculous! You delayed my flight and forced me to stick to the same flight, unless I am offering some extra money. And the gate agent could not change my reservation and I would have to go to a transfer center somewhere far in the terminal. And there was not other flight available. In sum, I don't remember I ever ran into problems on both flights of a round trip and also was told to pay a fee to change a flight even if it was not my fault.

The flight I was supposed to have was now full. A ticket is no guarantee to actually fly! What makes it worse; it's business as usual, so as a passenger you just have to deal with it. Employees were disinterested and even completely unwilling to help at Schiphol. Was stunned that KLM's service level had dropped to this level. Finally got in touch with customer service; apologies and the message that I did arrive at destination so that's why they don't apply compensation. They also indicated that it was normal that a flight was overbooked and that you could be placed on standby. Wanted to speak to a manager, but they said they would close the case and stop responding to my emails. Horrible start to the holiday and cringeworthy service.

Wat het erger maakt; het is de gewone gang van zaken, dus je hebt het er als passagier maar mee te doen. Medewerkers waren ongeïnteresseerd en op Schiphol zelfs totaal niet bereid te helpen. Was verbluft dat het serviceniveau van KLM naar dit niveau was gedaald. Uiteindelijk contact gehad met de klantenservice; excuses en de boodschap dat ik wel op bestemming was aangekomen dus daarom hanteren ze geen compensatie.

265,Robert Warren,United States,2023-06-18,3,"We were flying from Washington, D.C. to Cardiff in the UK.  The trouble began when we were about to board a connecting flight at JFK in New York City: the flight from Amsterdam to Cardiff was cancelled literally 30 minutes before we boarded the flight out to Amsterdam. We were held at the gate while they rebooked everything, and we nearly missed our flight. The flight to Amsterdam was rough: we wanted to sleep, but there were very loud passengers behind us, and they wouldn't be quiet for a minute. Once in Amsterdam, we were routed to Edinburgh in Scotland, then flown to Cardiff on Loganair. We were told we might have additional baggage fees, but we lucked out and this didn't happen. We got to Cardiff about five hours late, and we were exhausted by then. We had to fly back on KLM, and the fun started again. The plane was held up on the tarmac in Cardiff after they realized the plane was leaking deicer fluid from the wings, and we sat there in a hot plane for about 90 minutes while a technician tried to fix it. At one point, they announced the plane would not be able to fly. However, they were able to fix it somehow, so we weren't forced to get rebooked for another flight and spend hours waiting around Cardiff. The flight from Amsterdam to Dulles in D.C. was relatively harmless, although I found the flight attendant we had rather rude. She lectured me at one point because I had put some trash in a plastic water bottle. Finally, we made it back to D.C. and through passport control. And we started waiting for our luggage on the carousel, and we waited and waited for one large bag, because, as it turned out, it had been left behind in Amsterdam. So, we had to file a claim and wait two more days until our bag finally showed up. My wife was taking another trip and only had a day to do laundry afterward. I wasn't impressed overall.

Last but not least, our last flight was delayed by two hours and the only offered option instead of our actual transfer flight was to stay at the airport for 10 hours, again no offers of food or lounge without going to the counter and waiting in line for an hour. What took the crown was that our automatically rebooked flights and human rebooked flights were all still in the system with no tickets reissued. That meant that we were unable to check in, unable to reserve seats, unable to get the seats we payed for and altogether made it impossible for the lady at the counter to understand what was going on without calling KLM directly.

After having completed so many surveys for KLM where they wanted to know how valued and special I felt as a customer, now they seem not to care any longer at all about their customers. I used to be a flying blue gold member, almost reached platinum and now I am still a silver member. Despite this, the way KLM now treats me every time I fly with them is worse than the cheapest of the airlines. Their staff do not appear to know or understand the applicable benefits for each of their membership levels. It clearly states on the website that silver flying blue members have priority check-in, baggage drop-off and boarding. However, every single time I go to any of those lanes I am told extremely rudely that I am not allowed to use either of these services. Even when I show them the current KLM flying blue website / the KLM App that clearly states that silver members have those benefits, I am told that it no longer applies. In February 2023 KLM left us stranded in Tanzania for 24 hours due to allegedly security threats. However, when going to the official Dutch foreign ministry advice for travelling no alerts were provided for the area we were in. After I finally returned home, I filed a claim to KLM for compensation which was denied with no explanations. Then I filed a claim for reimbursement of expenses (namely 1 extra day at the hotel and 1 extra day at Schiphol long term parking) and I only received a refund for the hotel. I asked at least 25 times to KLM via all the channels they have (email, website, KLM customer service support at Schiphol airport, Messenger, flying blue phone number) why I didn’t receive a refund for the parking expenses.

Ticket bought from Ticket.com and easily handled online on KLMs homepage. Check-in online with success, but it does not reduce check-in time in Airport, so it just wastes time. Luggage checked in the whole way and delivered perfectly in Kigali. Seat choice functions well and is free to Flying Blue (elite) card holders. As both flights became almost full, I had to change my seats accordingly; eventually I got a (5 cm only) more spacious “Economy Comfort” seat which almost reassembles “Premium Economy”, which is a class higher. On the short haul I picked a declinable exit seat and had the whole row to myself. Lounges in Copenhagen (Aviator, 2 choices) and in Amsterdam (4 choices) are both nice and provide excellent breakfast. They open as early as 5 am, which made use possible. In the KLM Lounge 52 in Amsterdam, there is a new hype with their extremely popular Mimosa drink (champagne with 25% orange juice, blended, not stirred). Full catering service onboard on both flights, even the short haul to Amsterdam. FAs were good and energetic, particularly on the short haul. On the long haul, however, some cabin crew tend to patronise the passengers. Onboard supplies are quite sparse, unless one pushes. Call buttons are only answered after long time waits. Long haul rendered 2 hot meal services, but the food is not good, apart from the starters (Mediterranean Mezze). I tried both main dishes offered at lunch and they were both disappointing. They offer hot and soft drinks but also Heineken and (cheap) wines onboard; however, the red wine is somehow good (Shiraz from South Africa). I brought along my own glasses as I refrain drinking from paper mugs. Cutlery is made of wood. IFE (only longhaul) is good; bring your own headset. Conclusion: Recommended. All flights on time. Value for money. As usual, luggage was handled correct. Catering is clearly subpar compared to other legacy carriers.

When I arrived to the check in gate in Houston I was told that I had been downgraded from Premium Comfort to Economy because of a change in aircraft and that my baggage allowance had changed. I had packed my bags the night before and then woken up early to drive 3 hours to Houston to catch the flight. Needless to say, I wasn't willing to throw any of my luggage in the trash. I told them there wasn't any way that I would have had time to re-pack my bags (now noticing that I had received an email at 3 am notifying me of the downgrade.) After much discussion I was finally permitted to take all my luggage with me. The rudeness and lack of understanding at the counter was disgusting. On the plane the staff were perfectly friendly.

On the return flight I had the opposite problem - my meal plan had resurfaced but the food I'm allergic to was very present in the dish. I notified the staff that I had an allergy and was there anything else I could possibly eat? I'm not picky, I just don't particularly want to break out in hives. She very begrudgingly searched around until she found something but she wasn't happy, saying that I had requested a specific meal. I acknowledged her, and said yes I had, but the ingredients aren't listed when I select it and - I have an allergy. For the next meal she brought me the dish again, with the food I'm allergic to, and smiled when she handed it to me. Oh joy. The smile on her face made me stare at the food in disbelief in front of me. I accepted it and just didn't eat. How could she smile like that? I had submitted a request for the refund fare difference for the first flight and it was accepted but I was told that I needed to resubmit it again after all flights are finished. I guess because they can't keep track of it for a week? The service I received was atrocious. The red tape ridiculous.

My traveling companion uses a wheelchair. KLM said they would assist us from the Lounge to the airplane and, when we arrived at IAD, from the airplane through customs to the baggage area. Sadly, the assistance did not come. I had to somehow make my way with carry-on luggage while pushing the wheelchair. I am over 80 years old and getting wheelchair assistance was exactly why we purchased business-class tickets. When we got to the gate at Schipol, the attendants did assist us getting onto the plane. On arrival at IAD, however, we - and the other wheelchair passengers, were told to wait in the aircraft until our wheelchairs came to the door of the plane. This took close to an hour! There were not enough assistants to push all the wheelchairs. So, we were all left sitting at the gate for the plane with the passengers who were getting ready to board the plane staring at us. Finally, as a group, we told the few attendants who were assigned to us that we should proceed.  We asked the assistants to help the weakest and those of us who were stronger, slowly proceeded to customs. When we got to customs, there was a separate line for wheelchairs. This line was shorter and moved more quickly than the line for able-bodied passengers. Unfortunately, our wheelchair assistants left us saying they had to go to assist other handicapped people. We all helped each other to the customs inspectors. I realize KLM is not responsible for the wheelchair assistance at IAD but they did leave us standing unattended having deposited us off the plane in plain view of the next group of passengers who were waiting to board the plane for the flight back to Amsterdam.

During this process I have spent approximately 8 hours on the phone and been ""disconnected"" four times without a return call. It seems KLM just ignores the customer in hopes they go away. They put all the work on the customer rather than take charge. This has been the worst customer service I have ever seen. I hope KlM provides further training for their employees.

283,Anders Pedersen,Rwanda,2023-04-19,6,"Flew KGL-AMS-CPH with KLM 16 April 2023 on A330-200 and B737 aircrafts. Economy Lite ticket was quite cheap, bought from an OTA and easily handled online on KLMs homepage. Perks as Flying Blue gold card holder was given throughout from priority, lounge, selecting preferred seat, etc. Check-in online did not work – wasted time on several attempts. However, the check-in KGL was quick and hassle-free. Got option to select a better seat as the flight was full; I chose an exit seat, 30B, which was a real winner and one of very few seats with gorgeous leg space. Such a seat costs 300 EUR if prebooked, but was offered to me during check-in free of charge, likely due to my gold card. This seat, given to me in the last moment, saved my trip as the original seating had changed; the flight had become completely full and I about to be given a seat in a very crowded section near toilets. Access to KLMs 3rd party Pearl lounge was granted due to my Flying Blue gold card. The lounge is well supplied, but of sparse offerings. Departure from Kigali became 4 hours delayed; however, all delays were properly informed on monitors, by email, and by SMS. That caused me missing my flight in Amsterdam, but I did not stress: just went to the KLM lounge and printed out the revised BPs for the last leg to CPH, which was scheduled ambiently. Enjoyed a solid, nice breakfast in the impressive KLM “52 Lounge” in non-Schengen sector. Passport control and security check took more than an hour; not acceptable. The serious delay, arose from a wheel puncture while the aircraft stopped over in Zanzibar. It was explained in detail by flight crew and from cockpit. A new flight crew had just boarded in Kigali; they were fresh, well groomed, and well rested. Service was fine, but food provided was very little, though included a small, hot airy pizza (no alternative). The wines offered were of RSA Cape origin: The red wine (Shiraz) was good, while the Chenin Blanc white wine was undrinkable. They were served in well labelled mini-bottles which are a nice touch. The cabin crew differed tremendously in attitude, ranging from the typical, surly, patronising classic Dutch crew, to more modern and empathic types. Initially, I was not recognised as status flyer, but later they found out and provided me a full amenity kit and a Dutch ceramic mini-house as souvenir. Disembarkation in Schiphol was tedious by using busses from a remote stand. Last flight to CPH was briefly on time, and service onboard was fine. Luggage handled correctly throughout and arrived in CPH timely, despite having been rebooked and re-labelled. The experience with KLM was good. The serious delay from Africa was well handled: professional and faultless.

I called KLM customer service again and told him about it and he suggested to pay and when I go back to the States, I can submit a request for refund and compensation. After I did so and traveled back to the States and immediately filed a claim, KLM refused to honor their promise and every time came up with different excuse like 1- we did not cancel or change your flight, you did- when I gave them proof they came up with 2- you did not pay us, you paid your travel agency, get your money from them, when I told them I had spoken with KLM customer service in Dubai and he promised me that, they came up with 3- give us an evidence that you called KLM and a recorder that he promised you and we will investigate?

And to make matters worse, they put us on a connecting flight on my birthday, which only added insult to injury. It's obvious that they have no regard for our personal needs or preferences. The fact that KLM Airlines can't even provide basic reliability and customer service is truly disappointing. It's difficult to imagine a more frustrating and inconvenient situation than having our travel plans disrupted at the last minute, especially when it comes to something as important as a birthday celebration. In conclusion, I would strongly advise against using KLM Airlines for any future travel needs. Their inability to deliver even the most basic level of service is a clear indication of their disregard for their customers. If you value your time and sanity, I suggest you steer clear of this airline at all costs.

This necessitated leaving a family get together and extra charges for an airport hotel, and taxi. I claimed those expenses from KLM. After over three months, KLM replied, saying that as I had booked online on the KLM website, KLM had no obligation to notify me, but I had an obligation to keep checking for changes in the schedule.

I have been travelling with infant numerous times between Europe and South America (KLM, Brasil) and between Europe and Asia (Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways, Lufthansa), and it has never been a problem getting an infant bassinet - until now. When purchasing the tickets, I always follow up by talking with a real human to ensure my request for an infant bassinet is registered in the booking. I then repeat the request upon check-in as soon as it opens (typically a day before departure, depending on destination). KLM has not delivered on our 3 last intercontinental flights, leaving us with an infant on our laps for 14 hour flights. All the while, we can see the seats where infant bassinets can be utilized are occupied with passengers not travelling with infants. Children grow quickly, and I doubt we will have more children.

Equally with the baggage handling companies, whose personnel is not well paid unfortunately anyway. Now with air traffic resuming to pre-pandemic levels, that same personnel is impossible to come by. Of course they have found more reliable employers as there is a general labour shortage anyway. As a result and to be fair, KLM is caught in the middle. KLM has had to drastically cut back on flights and occupancy, in a time where it was hoping to make up lost revenue during the pandemic. Customer service is therefore swamped in claims, while staff there too is undoubtedly in short supply. This is sad to see because the on board service is excellent and the seats in business class are good and can recline fully.",Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Amsterdam to San Francisco,September 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,True,Amsterdam,San Francisco,

As a result, I had to be rebooked arriving a day and a half later. UK law obligates them to a partial refund, but they are denying the request saying I was a no show, not acknowledging that the flight was missed du to their itinerary change and lack of communication.

349,S. Jackson,Canada,2022-10-26,4,"Coming back from Europe on KLM was not pleasant, after a lovely holiday. I've happily flown KLM Economy many times in the past, but there is a definite decline in the service offered now! The one thing I will say is that there was good leg room and I am 5'7"" tall, so that was a positive. they do not carry any pillows now for Economy passengers. You do get the see through blanket and a bottle of water. Meals: first meal of dinner was fairly tasty, a chicken curry. However, they offered bread rolls, and when I told the cabin crew that I had no butter on my tray, she said that they found out about a month before that butter had been deleted from meal trays .. they only knew because so many passengers were asking for it! Dessert was handed out later, a tasteless yellow cake in a plastic wrap. The cutlery is now made of flat balsa-like wood, stamped into shapes of knife, fork and spoon. Like eating with hospital tongue depressors. The second meal was unidentifiable .. a boiling hot piece of a pizza like sandwich with no discernable filling, and a sloppy salad, beige and liquid with nothing really to tell what it was. The staff were delightful, but these little ""economies"" by KLM have put me off flying with them ever again.

350,A Garner,Canada,2022-10-24,1,"Booked these flights months in advance. From Edmonton to Athens with a layover in Amsterdam in order to catch our flight to Egypt to meet our tour group. KLM changed our flight times without even notifying us (this is not acceptable), we happened to look ourselves and realized that 3 weeks prior to our departure date we would not be able to make any of our connections (panic!) My travel partner spent hours on the phone with KLM sine I was working - she would be put on hold 15 minutes at a time by the agent who was nothing but rude and unhelpful and she was told vague different reasons for the flight changes from different employees. It seemed like they were trying to get rid of us or it was a hassle to assist us. KLM offered to place us on new flights that were not reasonable and eventually after hours agreed there were no reasonable flights and would refund us our tickets. We then had to rebook our flights which cost more as we were now only 3 weeks away from leaving and took us on a completely different flight path. This caused us to have to cancel hotels and re-book others. On top of this we were informed our refund of about $1400 would take 3-5 MONTHS! I understand these things happen, but I believe we should have had better communication and assistance. They also changed our flights coming home as well and I had to take another day off work, but I'm not even focusing on that. Based on what I have read in the air passenger protection regulations I do not think they abided by code.

351,D Karson,Netherlands,2022-10-24,2,"Poor impersonal service in economy class, far from what KLM wants its potential clients to believe with their marketing campaigns, delivering a excellent service and life long loyalty, we fly together, you feel at home with us etc., etc. I had the pleasure of spending 10 hours with KLM. The seat in economy comfort, ample leg room, but horrible comfort after 6 hrs. you do not know how to sit comfortable. Just after the start you get bottle of Spa water with a small package containing a small tissue to clean your hands, it is the only one you get during the flight. Thereafter you have to wait 1-1,5 hrs. to get your 'exquisite' dinner, a choice between vegetarian or chicken, this is served with a large basket which seems to be a salad, all served on a tray with non-slippery top side, which tends to move over your seat table as no anti-slip is installed under tray. so you have risk that your complete meal including beverage ends up in your lap, Regarding the taste of the food served, the chicken meal is neutral/ ok, but not very tasteful, the salad which seems to be a highflyer by KLM, is too awful to further describe, it tastes horrible, KLM should be ashamed to serve this to customers. the piece of bread which comes with dinner is though and hardly eatable, the piece of cheese sticks to its plastic packaging. The 'exquisite' dinner is served with one beverage, no further beverage service during or afterwards. After dinner you wait another 45 mins to get coffee and the famous cake, which KLM is proud to serve. This cake is very very sweet and again without any taste, except the sweet, overall it is just a tasteless piece of cake. After the coffee, you have to wait couple of hours for any further service is provided, This time a hump of bread served which seems to be cheese and some kind of sauce and a bottle of water, no other choice of beverage. The bread again is tasteless! Just short before landing the last service is done, again the famous tray with anti-slip topside, but no anti-slip underneath the tray, so large risk that the content of tray and your beverage will end up in your lap. This serving is a hump of dough with some cheese and sauce, which KLM calls a pizza snack, the dough, sorry pizza, is so tough it is difficult to swallow. Again some kind of salad is served, again tasteless and some kind of dessert, which turns out to be cream with some cookie crunches and caramel sauce. With all the food being served no salt and pepper is provided, also no hygiene tissues are provided. No announcement is being made that in case you require additional beverage and/or snack you can go to one of the galleys Summarizing the food and service on this KLM flight was horrible and it is a full disgrace what they are offering for food. KLM was once solid consistent quality performing airline, but now they are completely lost, no more focus on the customer who pays top dollar to fly KLM, instead they focus on social community aspects. Management or whoever is in charge of cabin / inflight service have totally forgotten about their customers and/or try to force them into sustainable, vegan, vegetarian options which might be high on the agenda of KLM, but not always high on the agenda of their paying customers. Although it is not easy to say, this KLM and its service is far from the KLM it once was.

However, the whole flight was disrupted and the airline informed us that both the outbound and the return flight would be at a different time. This was a hard thing, but I understand that some changes are unavoidable. So I booked new seats again, since flights and aircrafts were not the same as before. It was difficult to have changes with more than 6 hours, but well, this happens. However, what I do not understand is: What happened to my money spent for booking the initial seats? Of course I tried to get the money back (""refunds""), and I invite everyone who is reading this to try and see what happens when you try to get your money back: nothing. You are directed to an online form which is literally impossible to complete - as, for example, you must find out your EMD number, and I can only wish you good luck for this. In short, I assure you, you will never succeed. The information asked from you is so complicated that you will never find out what they want from you.

I had to keep the trays with food on my table because the wife was holding the baby and it was impossible to eat both at the same time, when I returned my tray faster so that my wife could eat, I heard a comment from the flight attendant that you all have problems with your children. KLM, if you change seats a few hours before departure, give at least one free seat to the family with a child. Especially since you took a place with a cot that had a lot of space. Giving the reason that the plane was not full and we had to change to a smaller one. Eating also on the return flight is a massacre, free snacks were terrible on the flight to Brazil, although there was free cola beer or sandwiches on the return flight, only very bad cakes and water.

Delta was great with our first flight to Atlanta, and everything went downhill from there. When the time finally came to board our long flight with KLM, our excitement immediately fizzled. We arrived in Amsterdam and had a 24 hour layover, which we understand happens .... finally after trying to sleep in the airport overnight, it was time to board, at that time the staff announced our flight was delayed due to ""short platform staff"". After about 30-40 minutes they canceled it completely! At this time the staff at the gate would not help, we were sent across the airport, a good 10 minute speed walk, to a self serve kiosk to try to rebook our flight.

We try to find a KLM help desk, there was only Air France who refused to help as the connecting flight they booked us for was Loganair,  we were directed to a Gate for Loganair, where there was not a sole to help. Needless to say we were stranded!! We found a customer service desk for swiss airlines, and even though she does not work for KLM or Logan she tried her best to help, gave us KLM's customer service phone number and let us use her phone. after 30 min of hold time someone finally answered and said the next available flight wouldn't be until the next day, after we told him our situation he told us to just get someone at the airport to help .... the airport that had no one to help. Mind you we are how losing 3 days of our vacation! Money thrown out the window so to say. We were advised we should catch a train, the lady from swiss helped us find our luggage and we spent $123 per person to get a train. While we stood there waiting for our luggage to come down to us, we heard about 5 more horror stories on how KLM canceled and screwed them over with no help from staff! We lost 3 days of our 6 day vacation, that's money we lost for our previous hotel booking and car! Then New hotel charges out of pocket, and food for 2 days, as well as a train tickets to our actual destination.

I was stranded in Kuwait with kids in tow for 24 hours. Missing luggage: no surprise when we land in Mumbai, the kid’s stroller and car seat didn’t arrive. Appalling customer service: I filed a claim online for flight delay-missing connection and missing luggage in June. There's no way to contact a human agent.

With their children in tears because they couldn't sit with their parents an airline worker said ""well do you want to fly or not?!"" to the parents.

Turns out they had re-assigned them to all middle seats throughout the plane to upsell aisle seats and paid no attention to the ages or that it was a family.

This is unfair and very unprofessional totally disrupting the whole family plans and events that have been cancelled due to non arrival of baggages.

408,C Pearce,United Arab Emirates,2022-06-27,2,Customer service is very poor. I attempted to purchase cabin baggage and after 3 attempts to call I was told I must wait and purchase at the desk on the day of my flight. They would not provide me with a price either. Upon arrival at the airport for my flight I was quoted a price of 95 Euro for 23kg. I would not have taken an extra bag if I was provided this price before traveling to the airport. There needs to be better customer service where a customer can be provided with this information ahead of time. By taking this additional cost into consideration it would have been much more affordable to travel with a different airline that allowed cabin baggage at an affordable price.

In 8 hours. The purser mocked saying crew don’t organise taxis either. Dumped passengers in Vancouver. No ground crew. It was survival of the fittest. The usual ‘can do’ attitude of KLM was changed to we will ignore passengers. 2 1/2 hr delay was a cost avoidance exercise by KLM corporate to get a full plane.

Because of the 1 hour 45 minute waiting time in Amsterdam, everything was looking good for me. I went to Mexico City airport 3 hours ago because of the precaution of some long waiting times, but check-in and baggage drop transactions were extremely quick. I am really appreciative for that. However, when I went to gate for boarding, boarding had not started. We have waited so long and after 1 hour 30 minutes from original departure time we have departed. When we were in flight, the hostess announced please check your e-mail, sms or mobile application for the connecting flight update. When we landed in Amsterdam, of course my other Frankfurt plane has gone and KLM checked in for a soonest Frankfurt flight for me and for this flight they gave me sky priority. Because of the sky priority, I had also tracking bags section in mobile application. When I tried to track my bag, there was only one notification for check-in, after that nothing happened. I had understood that probably they lost my baggage. After we landed to Frankfurt am Main, I have waited for my baggage and it did not come. I went to lost baggage desk and she said to me my baggage is still in Amsterdam and in 1-2 days we are going to send your baggage directly to your home address and because of the 1-2 days situation I was happy.

Flight was late arriving to Geneva and I was supposed to fly to Ghana from Amsterdam so missed my connecting flight. There were no flights that day so had to fly the next day. I was told in Amsterdam I would get a refund for the delay and also had to take a covid test as the one I had would have no longer been valid, which I was also told I would be reimbursed for. This was on 10 Dec 2021. After following up regularly I was told each time that my claim was being processed which I now know was a not the truth as on 10 June I received a message saying ""Thank you for your communication dated 11 December 2021. I regret the unintentional delay in responding to you"". Today I received a response saying ""the flight was delayed due to the late arrival of the incoming aircraft as a consequence of adverse weather conditions"", without further explanation, and as such I was not entitled compensation, or refund for the covid test which on the KLM website would be considered as ""unforeseen expense""(which you could claim for). I am highly confused as to what the adverse weather conditions was. They simply sent this one line after 6 months of my follow up without providing any evidence even though as per the EU air passenger rights it says ""To be exempted from paying compensation, the airline must prove that: i) there is a link between the extraordinary circumstances and the delay or the cancellation, and ii) the delay or cancellation could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.""

Check-in online did not work – likely due to summer-overload of passengers in Amsterdam which causes disruptions and delays on the entire route-net. However, the check-in KGL was quick and hassle-free. Access to KLMs 3rd party Pearl lounge was granted due to my Flying Blue gold card. The lounge is well supplied, but of sparse offerings. The arriving aircraft in Kigali came in 1 hour late. The KLM staff called all passengers to gate; after wasting an hour in the gate they came back to the terminal and lounge due to further delays: the aircraft had got another, now technical problem (a clogged engine filter?), which they manage to fix in the airport. However, this added to the delay by another 2 hours. The now 3 hours’ delay followed us the whole way to AMS where most passengers eventually lost onwards connections. All entering and exits to aircrafts were by foot and stairways. Onboard, flights were full, haven’t seen this since before the pandemic. KLMs flight crews onboard are in general patronizing and surly, but they managed well. Food was surprisingly good, seems improving with 3 hot meal options for dinner. Hot snacks provided before landing. Managed to sleep 3 hours on the longhaul. IFE worked wel with individual, tiny screens with movie choices. Headsets provided. WiFi not working? In Amsterdam it took 45 minutes to vacate the aircraft which was taxied to a remote area of the airport. Huge queues in Amsterdam due to summer peak and staff shortages. I was fairly lucky to be rebooked on next AMS-CPH flight departing 2-3 hours later. Lounges in AMS are good, spacious and modern. Despite the delays the last flight and arrival in Copenhagen went well and smooth. CPH airport is a breeze. My inscribed luggage arrived to perfection, despite rebooking, delays, and transfers.

Once I left the restroom, a flight attendant was waiting outside and immediately asked “where is your seat?” After I explained my situation and even apologized for using the restroom, she rudely said “you were in there for 10 min. You can’t be here and need to stay in your class, we don’t make exceptions here. Please return to your class.” I am hoping that in the future, exceptions can be made in such cases, as I would think that an economy passenger using a business class restroom in an emergency, would be more pleasant to both passengers and staff, than the smell of vomit / cleaning up after a sick passenger.

It’s been 5 days now and still no sign of our luggage. Many phone calls later and being on hold for hours no one is able to give me a timeline on when we can expect our luggage or information about some sort of compensation for having to buy new clothes, toiletries etc. for a family of 5.

I was told that I had to pay the price difference between the new and the old ticket, which was another 800€. I had no choice so I gave them my card information to pay the price difference, but when I got the price overview on mail I realized I had been charged for all fees 3 times - so pretty much 400€ too much. I called customer service right away, and was told I could fill out an online form after my trip. I tried this when I was back home, but the form didn’t work because “i had already used my ticket”. Now it’s been 1,5 month and I have still not succeeded with claiming my money back. I’ve been told they haven’t received the money (something my bank said they have), I’ve been told to send an email to this address that never responded, and in customer service I’m just being sent around.

443,Joe Mcdaid,United Kingdom,2022-04-22,1,"KLM pre pandemic were a good airline. However since covid they have become worse than the budget airlines. My most recent flight really sums up the mess that is KLM at the minute, they lost my bag in Schiphol. Ok this happens and they used to be very good at getting it to you but I guess as a cost saving exercise they’ve switched to a budget courier, so I land Tuesday 19th April without my luggage after I dozens of phone calls, WhatsApp messages I learn it’s somewhere in Schiphol. Once they locate my bag the ship it to Leeds and hand it off to what I can only assume is a man with a van. The companies name is Eagle aviation and at first glance on their website they look professional but once you try and contact them it all goes wrong. They have a premium rate number to call that leaves you on hold for 10-20 minutes then cuts you off, their website has a tracking feature showing an ETA but once this comes and goes how on earth do you get your baggage when they don’t answer emails or calls? I know this is a review of KLM and not the courier company but by giving this company a contract they are by extension a representative of klm and the responsibility lies with klm. A very quick Google search and 2 minutes reading the reviews of said company tells you all you need to know about them yet KLM clearly didn’t do this as I suspect they were just the lowest bidder. So back to klm, after reaching out to them about my bag because I have nowhere else to turn to I’m just fobbed off with “we will look into it and pass your concerns on to the relevant department” I’m really at a loss so I need to start driving around the UK looking for my bag at courier depots?

When we arrived to Amsterdam, our luggage (and about 10 other groups of people) was not on the carousel. One of the other passengers made a comment that this same thing happened last time she flew KLM but she figured it was a fluke and gave them another chance. We are now six days later. There has been absolutely no update. Initially we were promised our luggage later that evening, which seemed reasonable as there were six more flights from Heathrow to Amsterdam that day. As of today, they will give us no update, will not tell us any information about the luggage searching process, and today hung up on me when I asked why we had to fill out the bag inventory again (we completed the inventory and have a confirmation email with the completed form).

I tried to book an award ticket after being a long time passenger with KLM. Nothing wrong with the flights and they are nothing special, business or economy, KLM pretend to be better than they really are, but generally the flights are ok. I wanted to book an award ticket and didn’t succeed as the app kept gave an error on the payment page. It kept doing it. So I tried to call them. To have them book it that way. As it’s an award ticket that has to be with their ‘Flying Blue’ desk. They were closed at that time. So I tried to use KLM’ WhatsApp option. No answer, till this very day. So I tried to book the ticket again the next morning, required points had gone up double!! So I try to call again to have the issue solved. Automatic disconnection of the call as waiting times to long the voice said. So I tried a day later, points gone up even higher. After 40 minutes finally got a hold of the FB desk. To have them tell me they can’t help me and the points required are what they are and I should have called earlier! They should have picked up the phone earlier they mean. What a terrible service and no solution offered. So their app doesn’t work as it should and you can’t get a hold of them and they don’t help and say you should have called earlier. They basically say, “tough luck and all not our fault, can’t and won’t help”. Very very disappointing and I will think twice before I book any ticket with KLM again.

Their internet interphase works nicely in every aspect with full access to the booking. Luggage was a bit overweight and was labelled “Heavy”. It was inscribed to final destination where it arrived in good order. Boarding / de-boarding were easy and on jetbridges, except at final destination where a bus took us 150 meter (no carbon prize!) from aircraft to arrival hall. I chose to travel to AMS a day earlier than strictly needed to be sure to catch my onward morning flight AMS to KGL. The trip became a relief due to full utilisation of gold card privileges. This trip costed me less than 500 USD, and the return legs still remains. Extremely good value for money – and it earns me 46 X-points toward retention of my elite status at KLM. Was given a huge luggage allowance, 2 x 23 kg) that I decided not to fully use. CPH->AMS Aircraft was a newer B737-8. Saturday evening flight, not many passengers – I got myself an entire 3-seats section. The service onboard was good and snacks and plenty of drinks were handed out generously (incl. wine and beer). Two-three drink rounds were provided within this 55 Minutes flight is fine. Call bells addressed instantly. Can’t fault this airline – as good as it gets in economy. Lounges on the way… KLM offers 2 lounge in CPH: the third-party lounges Carlsberg Aviator and Aviator Apartments. Both were nice, tidy, and airy. Good view of tarmac. The draft beers (3 kinds) in the Carlsberg lounge tastes for some reason better than those poured in town. Upon arrival to Amsterdam I chose the non-Schengen KLM Lounge 25, which was more than OK and presentable though no without any extravagancy. They closed at 10 p.m. For the night I found a sleeping area until morning where I went to the Sky Team “Lounge 52” in non-Schengen area. Impressive design, views. Amble space. Showers. Breakfast was outstanding with fresh, hot delicious breads. AMS->KGL A330-200 aircraft. Flight arrived on time, though departing 20 min. late. Smooth seating and embarking procedures. Onboard, I was greeted by name and offered an upgrade for 64k Flying Blue miles which I declined as economy offers amble space these days. Premium economy was offered for 14k, but the armrests can’t be lifted so economy is a better deal when economy is only 65% full. KLM provides only a single meal service on this 7 hours’ flight which is too little. While a lunch is served at 12 o’clock, there is no supper prior to landing in Kigali, where one has to deal with lengthy immigration and Covid-testing procedures. The food was passable. Drinks were served reluctantly and only offered upon firm requests or by walks to the galley. Bell for service calls were rarely addressed. Symptomatically, I was offered hot drinks only once on this long-haul flight. IFE has improved since last year and more options offered. Screens are tiny, less than half size of those on Qatar Airways and Emirates. It seems that KLMs long-haul services suffer from excessive cost-savings on services and attempt to reduce all kind of intakes to a bare minimum.

I’m on the phone as I type this trying to get to them and I have been waiting for 53 minutes now. I don’t even think my request is this complicated as I just want to change my flight schedule. I called last week and an agent confirmed the change but mentioned that a recalculation would have to be done and that I would get an email after 24 hours. I waited for 72 hours without any feedback so I proactively reached out only to be told that we should be reaching out to our local KLM office for the change and was given a contact number which never gets answered for 24 hours straight so I called again and this time a third agent said it appears the first agent never sent any email for the recalculation and confirmed he has sent the email and that it will take 96 hours to hear back. I asked what if I don’t hear back after 96 hours and he replied I would have to call back. At this point, I am not really comfortable so I ask for a contact to the local office. He gave me another number to contact our local office which unsurprisingly doesn’t get answered. I finally was able to get through after some google search and this agent has no idea what is going on. I have to literally tell him my flight schedule and everything. I wonder if all the agents use the same system. It’s ridiculous and with the frequent long silence during the calls without any prompts, you wonder if the agents know what they are doing.

Due to existing plans in Geneva that day, my only option for rebooking was at 7am — which meant that I needed to be at the airport at 5am. Needless to say, after packing and traveling to the airport, I didn't get more than an hour or two of sleep that night. It was awful. After arriving in Geneva, I received a notification that I could request compensation for the cancelled flight. So I followed the link and did that. I received a total of €269.12 back.

When I called, they told me that when I applied for compensation from my previous flight cancellation, it automatically cancelled my return flight. KLM then told me that I would need to buy my return flight. Currently, that costs €1,659. So, to sum up: 1) KLM cancelled my flight 2) KLM offered €269.12 compensation then cancelled my return flight 3) KLM tells me I need to pay €1,659 for the return flight.

The only good thing I have to say about them is that the seats are OK and they have half-decent food. My initial flight from Leeds to Amsterdam was smooth enough (it was too short for them to mess up), but then the flight from Amsterdam to Nairobi was delayed by over an hour. We were not given any explanation beyond ""unforeseen circumstances"". I expressed concern to a stewardess about my connecting flight to Mombasa very soon after takeoff (I would have done so earlier but was ignored multiple times when I tried to get the attention of cabin crew members). She said it was too early to know if there would be an issue with me making my connecting flight and that we might make up a lot of time during the journey. However, when we landed, I had under an hour to get through passport control, collect my bags in Nairobi, go through customs, walk to Domestic Departures, go through security and get onto the plane! I expressed my concerns to another stewardess as I was leaving the flight, and she assured me that staff on the ground would help me. However, in practice, I ended up having to be proactive and beg members of staff for help. I ended up making it onto the connecting flight 10 minutes before departure purely through my own efforts. It was the last flight of the day. I do not know if I would have had any help from KLM had I missed it and been forced to spend the entire night in the airport in Nairobi. I had zero intimation from them that I would have received any kind of compensation or been booked into a hotel for the night.

They claimed that updates had been sent, however no message had reached our inbox or spam folder. In our online KLM portal on the website, the original flights were still scheduled! So how could we have known? After a very stressful day, we ended up getting on a next flight. Our meal that we had requested for dietary reasons, as well as our selected seats, were not available on this flight. For our return, they offered a different flight which would leave us with a full day layover in the Calgary airport. Or a flight a day later than planned. We had to decide quickly as the lady on the phone said we had to. We ended up selecting the flight one day later. After submitting a complaint for the lack of communication, they replied saying it was beyond their control and a compensation for our trouble, stress and having to rebook, was not possible.

473,S Kersen,United States,2022-02-01,1,"Visited Tromsø, Noway (TOS) Dec 2021 to see Northern Lights. Checked into my return flights (TOS-BER, AMS-AAL) on Dec 29 online about 10am for a Dec 30 departure; and everything looked good. Midday on Dec 29 (ie less than 24 hours before departure) I got email that one of the flights (AMS-AAL) had been cancelled and that KLM were looking at options. We could not extend our hotel and could find no other hotel options in/near TOS (it is a relative small, and VERY remote town) so I immediately tried to contact KLM (Holland #) to determine flight options. I got an automated message that ""We have more than 45 min wait time; please try your call later"", and call was disconnected. For the rest of the day, I called about once an hour with same result. In the mean time (around 6pm) I got another automated email that they had rebooked my itinerary on Jan 2nd. This was complete useless for several reasons. There were no hotels to be had in TOS, and we had flight back to US on Jan 2nd that we would miss. Finally that evening I called KLM # in US and was put into a call que. After 1.5 hour wait (at huge long distance fee), I got through to an agent and explained situation, and the agent essentially said ""tough luck"". KLM would not help find hotels in TOS, nor help us get out of town; eg if KLM had left my first two flights intact we would get to AMS, with lot better chance of finding a hotel and there were several options to get to AAL from AMS the following day, but KLM would not budge. I then asked KLM to switch me to nearly destination airport (BLL instead of ALL) and we could take a 2 hour train ride from BLL to ALL. KLM's own system showed such a flight with 7 seats available on Dec 30. However, KLM wanted more than $1000/ticket to make the change. When I insisted that KLM do something to help us out - leaving us stranded in TOS for 2 days without hotel rooms, wasn't really an option, they hung up on me. In we end we ended up buying completely separate ticket on different airline (SAS) at $500/ticket for Dec 30, and we are now fighting with KLM about getting a refund, which a different (and also not a happy story) What really got to me, was that KLM had several good options that they would have deployed:  KLM had a flight on Dec 30 to a nearly airport that would work, but they wanted completely unrealistic change fee (around $1000/ticket). They could have put us on the Dec 30 SAS flight (cost about $500/ticket) - same flights that we purchased ourselves. They could have flown us to AMS on Dec 30 and put us up for one night and completed journey next day) - I would even have been willing pay to hotel, however, they cancelled complete itinerary without talking to me and refused to reinstate the TOS-AMS portion",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,December 2021,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,,,

We arrived at the gate (E69) at approximately 5:30 am and were told that our flight was canceled due to severe weather and that TAP automatically rebooked us on a KLM flight for the following day, January 30, 2022. As we had not received an email or other notice communicating the new itinerary, I asked the agent for an itinerary with our new flight information. I also expressed my concerns regarding covid documentation requirements for our new connection in Amsterdam as I had only prepared documentation for a connection in Lisbon, Portugal. While sympathetic to our situation, he informed me that he was unable to provide additional information or print off our itinerary and instructed us to speak with an agent at the KLM service counter (where passengers can check baggage). Per his suggestions, we went to the KLM desk at approximately 6:15 am. After communicating our situation to the agent at the service counter, we were subjected to non-compliant behaviors by the agent. Inability and reluctance to provide pertinent information to us regarding our travel reservation. When I requested our new itinerary, she stated “the counter is closing I will not do that.” I informed her that the agent at gate E69 directed us to this counter for help. She continued to say that there are no more flights and that she did not need to be there. After continuously expressing that we were auto booked and don’t even know our flight numbers, she reluctantly printed our itinerary. Furthermore, we communicated that we did not know the travel documentation requirements for Amsterdam. However, she only stated that the US requires a negative COVID test. We showed her our passports, negative antigen tests, and documentation of recovery. She was unwilling to tell us what documents were needed for our route.  As part of the US entry requirements, we were prepared with official documentation of recovery documents that met the CDC guidelines. These documents were verified by multiple travel agencies and licensed physicians and met all requirements for documentation of recovery. She refused to acknowledge that these met the US guidelines and stated “No. It is my rule, I decide what is accepted and what is not accepted. This will not be accepted.” When we offered to show her the CDC checklists for airlines, she threatened to cancel our booking and began scanning our passports into the computer.  Refusal to escalate the issue to her superiors or identify herself as a KLM employee. As the discussion escalated, we asked to speak with another agent or supervisor. She refused to contact anyone else. We said we needed help, that our flight was canceled and that we needed information about our new route.

Seats and seat pitch are good, even for someone over 1.90 meters, middle seat was empty. Service was not great, to say the least. Staff was not very attentive, they did not seem to care for their passengers. A small meal was provided minutes after take-off, but … in a box. Horrible presentation.

Overall, a flight (2.15 h) that gave me very mixed feelings, but perfectly on time. I would certainly not consider KLM if I had to pay a full fare. Even the upgrade fee was, in hindsight, too much.

487,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2021-12-22,7,"Flew KGL-EBB-AMS-CPH 20 December 2021. First 2 legs on A330-200 business class while the last was on an Embraer-190 in Economy. Travel preparations went smooth. An early announced cancellation postponed my travel 1 day which was fine – I also modified it further to ensure amble time in AMS in my new favorite KLM lounge at Gate 52. I had a cheap Economy ticket but decided to upgrade by Miles at check-in in Kigali Airport. To my surprise it was very easy and quick – paid 75600 miles (KGL-EBB-AMS). Lounge in Kigali was Pearl Lounge: acceptable, spacious, good savory snacks, hot foods, and uncrowded. Drink supply of very poor options – the provisions are degrading more and more since 2018. Lack of quality mitigated by quantity – liquid enough was present – even for the thirsty. I even had a shower and was given the amenities for it (towels, kit, etc.). Boarding included a ridiculous early call from the lounge to sit and stare in gate for 45 Minutes prior to an awkward, superfluous bus-gating for 300 meter, degrading business class feeling to cattle class. Upgrade was worth it as the plane was overly full due to X-mas. Only 2 seats left in business and had to change seat in EBB (from 1A to 2B) in a 2x2x2 straight configuration. That was fine for me. Aircraft old – and the hard and soft product including the FA’s was in general was a bit retro old-fashioned, but acceptable and solid, though conform. FAs on KLM are very firm limiting to surly and arrogant, having forgot what true service, customer care, positivism, and respect is. First leg, 40 Minutes, offered only champagne and a drink round. No options of beer apart from the imposed monopolizing Heineken brand. Snacks offered were industrial prepacks, one worse than the other. Seat lie flats, big monitors, and IFE offerings were very limited but functioning – incl. noise reduction headsets provided. Wi-Fi offered for payment up to 30 EUR in business class- a disgracing rip-off. Food and drink offerings acceptable, not world class. Breakfast in a tray without any exotic offerings. Tea is a joke, they provide a teabag which you have to put into lukewarm water – eventually becomes only 50-60 degrees hot which can’t do any tea any justice – should be boiled with the leaves. Coffee below all standards. Amenity kit were given out, though boring composition, not worth to take along. Lounge 52 in Amsterdam is very good – I spent easily 4 hours there and got service from the KLM helpdesks. They recovered a lost luggage tag within 1 Minute.

Unfortunate as perhaps a decent drink might have numbed the disappointment in the pathetic food offered. First was the awful ""vegetarian sandwich"". We were offered this three times altogether on the return flight, a dry, stale scrambled egg sandwich with an nasty aftertaste of mustard. No alternative offered. As for the main meal, the first was a tasteless quinoa salad, mac and cheese with a small block of cheddar. On the return chicken and broccoli with disgusting slimy so called mashed potatoes. Breakfast on both legs was just a microwaved concoction like pizza and nothing else, no fruit, no juice, no alternative whatsoever.

494,Eelco van den Heuvel,Netherlands,2021-12-12,10,"KLM is starting to become my favourite airline. Again two flawless flights: Amsterdam-Bonaire and Curaçao-Amsterdam. One of the best things: ground staff (well, in Amsterdam, definitely not in Curaçao) en crew. We were greeted at Schiphol by a very friendly lady, who made a chat. Due to Covid checks we were advised to check in at least 3 hrs before our flight, but we were at the gate within 30 minutes. We decided to treat ourselves to lounge access for 100 euro in total. KLM's Crown Lounge is okay, but not sure I would do it again. Boarding in groups and punctual departure. Tasty meals - although a bit small - and enough drinks. I like the fact that they have a self service with drinks and snacks in the pantry. Very friendly crew. We were on the very last row in J and K, which is the only row in the 777 economy that had two seats. We liked that very much, because there is no-one beside you and you have more lag space. And in times of Covid at least it feels more safe since there is no-one behind you. Highly recommended! Quite a long trip to Bonaire since there is a stop in Aruba, but no big deal. Early landing in Bonaire and in about 30 minutes through customs despite Covid checks which were well arranged at the airport.

Called and would get an auto response after many prompts that the wait time is more than 45 mins so I am disconnected and instructs me to call back or go to their web site with all these great tools. Called back several times and the same response. Went to the web site and states I cannot reschedule my flight and to call their service line. Air France is worse. On hold for an hour multiple times then I get disconnected and the response tells me they can't help me right now. So I call back at 3:30am thinking it will be slower and I can get through. No-go. Recording states their call center is closed.  I depart in 10 days and I have no way of getting this fixed. Never had a leg rescheduled that conflicted with the full route.

Cabin crew on mainline and cityhopper were very polite and professional; mainline crew have the edge though and it is nice to see the stripes on their uniforms identifying seniority. Free beer/wine and soft drinks on all flights is very welcome. Sandwich given on both flights too which was fine for short flight.

Flight LCY - AMS got cancelled, which was a big negative and ruined my plans for the day. However, KLM promptly rebooked me on an earlier flight with BA. This leg with BA was quite enjoyable. The KLM Crown lounge at AMS was amazing, possibly, the most well-designed lounge I’ve been to : huge, yet cozy and has a great quiet area. The leg from AMS to SVO was nice, although with a pinch of salt. On one hand, the latest Recaro seats were very comfortable (even though being the same Economy seats), food was okay (although no better), crew monitored mask-wearing strictly and the purser was very nice and extremely helpful. On the other hand, soft product was very limited. No blankets and pillows (i understand it was only a 3-hour flight however, it was a red-eye arriving at 2am at SVO), no pre-departure drinks, no amenity kits. I was disgusted by one crew’s attitude. One of the passengers asked her something and instead, she rudely and in a clearly discriminating way demanded him to show his boarding pass to prove he was indeed in business class, no apology whatsoever. If i were that passenger, I would have filed a huge complaint to the airline. All in all, I am not complaining given that the flight was relatively cheap (£200 one way + €99 upgrade to business). However, I saw that KLM usually prices the AMS - SVO tickets similar to Aeroflot (c.£1,400 round trip), which has a million miles superior product and thus, for such a price, I would deem an experience to be completely unacceptable.",Embraer E190 / Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London City to Moscow via Amsterdam,December 2021,5.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,,4,yes,True,London City,Moscow,Amsterdam

Cabin staff were very polite and professional, announcements were minimal and promotional adverts only during boarding and deplaning at the gates. The food was repulsive, with the main course being some sort of fine noodles with a washed out seafood taste - not edible for me. The breakfast thing with something green in the scrambled egg roll was to me a repulsive smell and taste - plus more of that washed out fish base perhaps. The S. African red wine was delicious - I will be looking for CApe brand in the wine shop and wine section at supermarkets. The food was so poor in economy that if KLM economy travelled again I will my buy food before boarding.

Boardings / deboardings were easy and on jetbridges, except when leaving at final destination. Leg 1: CPH-AMS In Copenhagen airport, lounge was provided to Aviators’ Atelier Relaxium Business Lounge – hard name to remember. Surprisingly, it was open even at these inhuman ultra-early morning hours from 05 a.m. The lounge was good with solid buffet breakfast, mainly cold, tasty sandwiches on newly baked, hot bread, “rundstykker”. Aircraft was a well maintained B737-8. Despite being full, the service onboard was granted smoothly, including a good variety of snacks and cold and hot drinks. To my surprise, KLM had learned that I had birthday and congratulated me by name in front of other passengers in the fully packed aircraft. They then provided a handwritten, personal greeting and gave me a bottle of champagne on a tray with a design glass. Nice touch and icebreaker in an otherwise cold, surly, silent, morning atmosphere at 6 a.m. Lounge in Amsterdam provided was the KLM Sky Team “Lounge 52” in non-Schengen area. Very, very impressive design, views. Spacious was incredible. Must be the biggest lounge in Europe with 1500 seats? The drinks and dining was not up to the lounge appearance. No Asian dishes available, even noodles. Only one beer brand is offered in the entire lounge: Heineken – they must have paid a lot for this monopoly? 1st floor a la carte restaurant (food for purchase) while downstairs all the buffets and bars and other “areas” dominates. Leg 2: AMS-KGL On an A330 ageing plane. Flight arrived on time, though departing 20 min. late. Smooth seating and embarking procedures. Was greeted by name. Elite status and some ground work in Lounge with KLM eventually earned me an entire row for myself (4 seats) which was appreciated in an almost full plane though IFE was not working in that row. IFE was poor, old, and many passengers could not make it work. WiFi was present but neither really useful nor accessible. FAs were walking around in raincoats making them sweat, ridiculous, slow, and uncomfortable. Two hot meals were provided within this 8-hours trip. Food quality was substandard, just palatable. I had prepaid a special “Celebration Meal” which was delivered to perfection, but the food quality was not up to specifications and turned out to be just palatable. The meal costed me 35 USD which was not worth it as I was consequently, unknowingly deprived of the standard meals as for other passengers. Drinks were provided from trolley but not really flowing, and, outside meal service times, only if passengers actively requested them were they accessible.

My back pack was a hiking backpack that could be folded in half and clipped together if there were less content in the bag. Since I was carrying only a few things I had folded and clipped the backpack. They opened it up, stretched it and measured the backpack which was then a couple cms more than the allowed height. I asked them that I could fold the bag cause it was almost empty and they said that the 'original' size of the bag should be considered which did not make sense at all. When I argued that it could be folded and if not, its still 2 cms longer - they brought down more staff to pressure me into paying 8000 rupees for additional baggage fee, when the weight was under the allowance.

519,P Varmova,United Kingdom,2021-10-02,1,"Two times flew with KLM - and really never again. What happened with their customer service? It's worse than terrible - it's non-existent. One of my KLM flights was delayed and we had a very short connection. I was told by KLM crew when we were in air that I won't make it to the next plane (also with KLM) and to go and exchange my ticket. They didn't even let me disembark from the plane first so I could try to make it to the next leg. The service desk they directed me to was an automated kiosk that offered me a flight in 24 hours! I then had to find a service desk with people and wait for 45 min to be served. The customer service representative then told me that apparently I would have made it to the plane if I ran and questioned me about who told me that I was not going to make it to the plane. Lesson learned - do not trust what KLM flight crew tells you. My other flight that I booked on a different date (with a much longer connection) - the ticket says I can change the dates at any time. When you go to the app, it says ""sorry, you cannot change online, please contact us"". After 1.5h on the phone waiting for them to pick up - no response. Their so called ""24/7"" social media customer service is of course also non-responsive. It's an absolute joke.

520,N Birley,Ireland,2021-09-30,5,"Hugely disappointed with KLM at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Flying with them was fine, but the staff at the airport were terrible. I arrived at the airport 2 hrs pre-departure, plenty of time considering I had checked in online and wasn't checking a bag. The queue to check-in/get my boarding pass was a disaster - not moving for 40 mins, and then at a snail's pace for another 45. Every passenger seemed to have a problem & huge delay, but more consequentially, the staff were just slow, and far, far too relaxed. There was no organisation of the queue or the time being taken. Eventually I went to the neighbouring line, supposed to be for another flight, where the staff I dealt with started to produce my boarding pass (all I needed!), but got distracted and left me. Another one finally gave me the boarding pass, and at this time all my delay margin had been used up, and I had to run through control and to the security at the (distant) gate, sweating, breaking my carrier bag, creating the worst possible start to a long, multi-stop journey. Every individual staff member I dealt with at the check-in desk was: rude, unhelpful, completely apathetic whether I caught my flight or not, unprofessionally having relaxed conversations with colleagues while ignoring passengers - all who were anxious directly because of them. The system itself must also be questioned where slower, bag-dropping passengers are queuing with those already checked in and are not expecting such a slow line. A group of kids ahead of me in the queue - who caused much of the delay - were fast-tracked to the gate, I wasn't given that option despite being behind them, and barely told which direction to walk in (getting a scoff when I asked). Again - the staff on board - fine, efficient and friendly and the service is good, and the pilot's communication excellent.

The departures and arrivals were punctual, the flights were smooth and pleasant -- would have been pleasant but there were stressful because of the other conditions. Already at the check-in desk in Budapest they took my small Samsonite hand luggage from me saying that the flight was fully booked and my boarding pass contained a label 'Hand baggage not guaranteed in cabin'. It is a small 2-wheeled suitcase, I have been using it for years, it has never been taken from me. That is, it was not prepared for this kind of transportation (it was not locked, for example). Of course, the flight was not fully booked at all, approx. 70-80% of the seats were occupied, and there's a lot of free luggage space in the cabin. Then the worst part ensued: it was an almost one-hour waiting in a aprrox. 150m-long queue at the gate D8 (the queue stared at D2) with the passengers of UK flights for checking our documents (covid tests, passenger locator forms, etc.). We were not informed at all about what would happen when the time of closing gate was coming. One of the few helpers from KLM told me that there's no any guarantee that I could reach my flight to Aberdeen. In the 45th mintue of my ""sojourn"" in this queue I got the first sms from KLM, that my flight's gate was closing... Finally, when I was already sure that I missed my connecting flight, another helper of KLM cried around for passengers to Aberdeen then we (approx. 15-20 of us) had to run after her to the gate. It was absurd. I arrived in Aberdeen exactly 24 hours ago, but my suitcase has not.

And they changed one of our flights without informing us. I just found out because I had to fill out our plf and had to check the information for the form.

526,Farah Abdul Hafeez,United Arab Emirates,2021-09-01,1,"KLM put me through a real ordeal earlier this August. I had booked a flight to visit my family in Canada a month before my travel date of August 12th 2021. I started to prepare all the necessary documentation required for my entry to Calgary, Canada. Closer to the date of my departure, I had yet to receive my approval from the IRCC Canada to be able to enter the country. Wondering if I should postpone my flight dates, I called the KLM helpline, they were unable to give me any information and informed me that only the airport would be able to give me accurate information as to whether I could fly or not. After being told that I could get a full refund if they do not allow me to board the flight due to the COVID restrictions, I would be able to get a full refund on my full purchased ticket. With this information, I packed my bags and headed to the airport with plenty of time to spare, in case anything were to go wrong. Once at the KLM check-in desk, at the Dubai Airport, I handed all the documentation I had and the KLM representative started the process of printing the boarding passes. I interrupted him and mentioned that I did not have the approval from the IRCC which was stated as a requirement on their ""travel doc"" site. He assured me that I would not need it, I told him to please check for me to make sure, because I did not want to be stranded anywhere, he got up of his seat and proceeded to a team leader or a manager on duty and then assured me again that I would be able to fly and would not have any issues transiting through Amsterdam or entering Canada. With this information, I was very relieved and informed him that I was not prepared to fly today as I thought that that would be a requirement, but just for the sake of trying I decided to get the information first hand at the airport. He then mentioned to me that there was not a problem because I have all the other documentation which are important except for the approval which is fine. Long story short, once I arrived at my point of transit Amsterdam, they did not let me board the flight to Calgary, and informed me that I needed the IRCC approval to get on the plane. Completely distraught and disappointed, I took the next flight back to Dubai, leaving an hour later. That was how I spent my entire day, was lied to by a KLM representative who I put my trust in, and stuck on a plane for over 13 hours with over 5 hours of layover. When I decided to take up the matter with KLM customer care, they admitted to their mistake but still refused to give me a full refund for my full ticket flight that was completely wasted. I spent a total of AED 4,955 for the flight which was not returned. I then had to spend a lot more money trying to book a last minute flight to Calgary with another airline once the approval came out. I have never been more annoyed and insulted with KLM's deceitful actions.

531,D Paniccia,Canada,2021-08-20,1,"My 10 month old baby and I had to fly from Manchester to Toronto and we connected in Amsterdam. Before getting on the plane, we handed over my baby's stroller which was supposed to meet us at our connection in Amsterdam, however it never did. The flight attendants were amazing (the only good part of the experience) and tried to help us find it, even the pilot himself came to try and help, however he informed us that someone made a mistake and never put a tag on the stroller so it went straight through to Toronto. This was just the first bump in the whole catastrophe that was my experience with KLM. I then had to carry my 10 month old along with my bag throughout the airport and wait for our next flight. Anyone with a baby can respect that workout. I was a bit upset but understood that things happen. We finally got on our plane to Toronto and after a very long day we go to get our bags and as soon as I saw the stroller bag a KLM employee walked over to me because he could see that our stroller bag was ripped to shreds. As soon as I took the stroller out it appeared as though it was hit by a car. The wheels were barely holding on, the frame was bent and even her car seat and adaptors were broken and would no longer connect into the stroller or car seat base. This bag was clearly thrown around enough that even her blanket which was inside the car seat was ripped. This was my first time ever flying with my daughter. It was stressful enough without all of this happening but again I understand that these things can happen. The KLM employee had me fill out paperwork and explain what each product was and an estimate of how much they were. He provided me with a number which later on, proved to be useless. They said to call KLM when I got home to quarantine (Canada 2 week mandatory quarantine). I called KLM when I got home and explained everything. They told me I would be contacted in 2 days. 2 days passed and still nothing so I called again. I then got a manager named Rocky who told me I would be contacted in a week. Once again, I was never contacted. I then called again and pressed the prompt to see the status of the claim and I was put on the phone with a man. The only thing he was able to do was give me the claim number that I had already provided him with. He said that he was in sales (I don't know why that prompt brought me to sales) and told me that I needed to get in touch with customer service. I asked him if he could forward me to them and he said he was not able to. I then asked if I could speak to a manager and he said he did not know who his manager was. Keep in mind each time I called I was on hold for 2-3+ hours. And multiple times I was on hold for 3 hours or more and they would hang up. I could honestly go on forever about all of the specific things that this company did but to avoid writing a novel here ... long story short I did not hear back until more than a month later. And the only reason I did hear back was because I contacted KLM's media department who I was not supposed to contact about claims but I had no clue what to do anymore and wanted to try anything possible. Keep in mind I was told that I would know when I would either get a replacement or my money back within 2 days.

I received a travel voucher. I decided to exchange my voucher into cash in May 2021 because I wasn't going to use it. I filled the form online in order to do so. In the field ""Remarks"" I wrote clearly that the bank account that I originally purchased the tickets with is now closed and I would like to be contacted via email before the money transfer so that I could provide the employees with details of my functioning bank account and receive the amount. Instead of being contacted, I received an email that the money was transferred to my old bank account. I contacted my old bank immediately and they explained to me that if an amount gets sent to a non-existing bank account, it automatically returns to the sender account within few days. I have been in contact with KLM service agents via chat and explained the situation, asking them to process another refund. They asked for a document certifying that my old bank account is closed and that my old credit card doesn't function. I provided them with this document, issued from my old bank. Afterwards, they didn't process a new refund as they said they will, instead they told me that sometimes it could take up to 2 months for the amount that was sent to my closed bank account to return to them and that I will receive the amount on my new bank account after 2 months. 2 months have passed on the 5/08 and I have received nothing from them, no refund, no email informing me about the refund being processed. I wrote a reclamation on their website 1 month ago explaining everything because the only time when I could actually reach their customer service via phone, the employee told me that writing a reclamation is the only way to process my demand and that he cannot help me on the phone. I have received no answer to my reclamation. Customer service is impossible to reach via phone, and in Messenger/Whatsapp they reply within a day. Then you have to wait for another day for them to reply to your next message. When they do so, they ask the same questions that were already answered by me one day ago, leaving me with the impression that they haven't red the previous text messages. This really slows down the refund process, creates confusion and a feeling of complete disorder.

Beside their food being the poorest and their new lounge before Covid restrictions being extremely poor now it is even worse than before. The reason for this post is that KLM does not respect it's most faithful customers and makes any FQ status a farce. My status is plat for life. Check-in in Brussels was fine and fast but then when wanting to enter the diamond lounge I was not permitted to enter. Reason was that KLM has no contract with this lounge anymore. When calling the platinum service line I am told to go to pier b next to gate 1 and use the Brussels Airlines lounge. Firstly this lounge is closed, secondly this lounge is in the non-Schengen area of the airport and as I am flying within Schengen to Amsterdam I could not go through as I needed to go through passport control. This means that all business class, as all passengers entitled to lounge entrance have no lounge to go to when flying out of Brussels airport with KLM.

The flight attendant working there kept denying me wheelchair access despite my ticket saying I needed it and my visible crutches and cast.

At the first leg at Guarulhos Airport to Amsterdam, I flew in one of the most uncomfortable seats in my life (that's my wife's opinion as well), and I can say that I have some mileage regarding national and international travels. The food was good, and it was served three times. A small lunch when we departed, a dinner during the night, and a good coffee with some snacks before the arrival at Amsterdam. The airline mentioned that the flight were supposed to have onboard wifi, but that wasn't true. At least, the onboard entertainment catalog was ok. The second leg, from Amsterdam to Göteborg-Landvetter was extremely pleasant. The Embraer airplane was very comfortable and roomy. We booked a seat with extra leg space, but I felt that wouldn't be necessary for this flight. So my advice is: Get a extra room seat in the flight to Amsterdam, and the regional flights with Embraers are ok, if you don't want to spend that much. Arriving at Gothenburg, we found that my wife's luggage hadn't arrived.

I was initially due to fly on May 25th, but due to issues with my Covid-19 test, KLM rescheduled me onto the May 26th flight for free which was great! The check-in staff for KLM at Incheon airport were awful, however. Despite my final destination being Manchester, the check-in lady refused to send my bag there. I explained to her that I cannot leave airside in the Netherlands as I do not have a visa, therefore I need my bag to be sent to Manchester. She didn’t care and simply had it unloaded in Amsterdam. As a result, I ended up in Manchester without my bag and had to speak to a member of staff to organise delivery of my bag from Amsterdam to my home address in the U.K. Here’s hoping it will arrive tomorrow... The KLM staff in Amsterdam were a direct contrast of the staff at Incheon. They were so kind, considerate and very willing to help in any way they could which was wonderful to see, especially as travelling has now become so much more complex and daunting. The cabin crew onboard both KLM flights were also fantastic. Very warm, welcoming and accommodating. It was great to see social distancing being observed as much as possible on both flights and standards of cleanliness onboard seemed high. Food options on the initial ICN - Amsterdam leg were not great. Everyone received a pot of fruit, a yoghurt and a pastry towards the end of the flight with some juices, tea and coffee.

President Biden has also made a presidential proclamation earlier this year that a spouse of a US citizen may enter the USA (even during Covid-19). Our marriage certificate, population register, plane tickets, passport copies, and my families address and information was all not proof enough for KLM. We called TSA and we called the American Embassy and they both said these legal documents would be enough to prove our marriage and that my husband would be able to enter the USA. Apparently KLM has higher standards than the TSA, American Embassy, and American government combined. The refusal of letting my husband come is a violation to our rights and is breaking federal law. It is really sad my husband can't be here with me and my family right now. He is a part of our family, even if he is not a US citizen and he should be allowed to visit with family.

549,C Bolt,United States,2021-04-21,3,"I had other choices, but because of past pleasant experiences and the good reputation of KLM, I chose this. I realize that travel during COVID is complicated, and KLM surely made it even more so. Please let me outline my major issues: 1) First, I had trouble in the weeks leading up to my travel finding out what tests I needed to transit through Amsterdam and how I could get a PCR test that was given on 72 hours before landing in Amsterdam, yet be sure that I would receive the results on time. I realize that this is not KLM’s rule, but the people at KLM were not very helpful in guiding me on how to do this. I was told, “Other people do it, so you figure it out.” I was able to get more information from Delta. 2) The day before I left, I got an email that my flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain had been cancelled and I was rerouted through London. That was also what was shown on the KLM website, however, the Delta website had the original itinerary on it. When I got to the airport to check in, I was assured that my flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain had not been cancelled. To be sure, I asked the gate agent when I got to the gate. I was again told that I was on the originally booked flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain. However, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I found that was not the case. 3) There was no one to greet those of us on the canceled flight and tell us what to do - no signs, no guidance at all. 4) Being unable to check in at the automated site, after several attempts, I found that I had to go to the KLM transit office. The KLM person there asked for my COVID test results, and I showed her the printout of the result I had received. She said it was unacceptable! It was the official result that had been downloaded from the website, but she kept telling me it was unacceptable.Then, she told me I needed a copy of the visa to get into Bahrain, I always get the visa when I get there. She then told me that I did not have the correct paperwork to go through England. I was tired and frustrated. KLM sent me through London, then tells me I don’t have the correct paperwork to go through London! I had a copy of the quick COVID test that I had done Monday morning with my doctor’s signature, and she finally accepted that. I got my colleague at Arabian Gulf University to send me an electronic copy of the visa, and she accepted that. Then, before boarding, KLM agents wanted to see my COVID test results again. Fearing the same response, I also showed them my vaccination card that showed I had gotten two doses of Moderna in February. I was finally allowed to board the plane. Poor communication, poor customer service, lack of information. 5) When I got to London, I had no problems with my Corona Test Result report downloaded from the internet, and they did not ask for the visa. Poor communication. 6) When I arrived in Bahrain the day after I was supposed to arrive, my luggage was not there. Several passengers, those of us who were rerouted through London, did not have our luggage. I filed a missing luggage report. 7) I didn't get my luggage for two days, and I had to go pick it up from the airport.

550,Teodora Mechea,Sweden,2021-04-16,1,"This was, hands down, the most out-of-this-world idiotic experience I’ve had in quite some time. I have contacted CS because KLM has allowed me to book and pay for a flight they then showed canceled in the confirmation page. Was this designed to trick me into paying for something that isn’t available to then rebook me on an option nobody wants, perhaps. Or perhaps it was an issue of the internal system not correctly showing customers real-time information. In either case, it’s their fault and it felt irritating. The agent offered me a second option which I confirmed I wanted, proceeded to book me, and then two seconds later informed me that that flight too was canceled. Either a sick joke, I thought to myself, or complete incompetence. However, the agent then came up with a list of other options, all that were not ok for me because were arriving either too late in the night or they had me sitting 7+ hours in layover. At one point, however, they came up with an option that was more than impossible and then simply proceeded to book me and send me a confirmation without waiting for me to even reply. Why I say this option was impossible is because the connection flight was leaving at 10.40 while the first flight there leaving after that, at 14.40. You then understand how it’s impossible for me to bend physics and time and space continuum, to catch a flight that leaves hours after I’m supposed to catch my second. Total insanity. Upon insistent questioning I didn’t get even one apology, but a passive-aggressive message informing me to make up my mind quickly because all the available flights get booked quickly. The option the agent had next for me was a flight that seemed familiar, until I realized it was the exact flight they offered the second time - the flight that they booked and then informed me it was already canceled. So this person was offering to book me on a canceled flight, once more. This, my dear reader, is when I lost the will to live in this nightmare. I asked them if they were simply mocking me at this point. I begged for an answer once, twice, thrice, as they weren’t answering my messages at this point. After about 45 min the agent comes back, untroubled and provides me with another 2 options - one of which was again not possible due to limitations in the fabric of space and time. I gave up and agreed to one of the options that required me to spend 5 hours in layover, thinking it’s better than the rest of eternity in this purgatory. Now, you judge my experience and how many stars it deserves, but I for one cannot comprehend the level of absurdity I was forced to endure for about 7 hours while on your Customer Service messenger line.

551,Clare Barnaby-Smith,Indonesia,2021-04-09,1,"We booked two business class seats for travel on January 7th from DPS to SIN and return SIN to DPS on the 9th of January. Payment was by bank transfer and received 2 immediate confirmations; an email from Permata Bank confirming that the money was transferred successfully to KLM's bank account; the 2nd email was from KLM with booking confirmation (UKLFCP) complete with seat numbers (1A and 1C). We got to the airport (DPS) at 7pm for a 9.30pm departure, only to be told on check-in that our booking had 'not been paid for'. We showed the check-in staff our booking confirmation and the email + text from our bank confirming that the payment had been received by KLM. After being refused travel, we called the duty manager at DPS , who appeared to take great delight as he told us we 'didn't have a ticket'. We showed him our payment confirmation and booking confirmation, which mentions ticket conditions, etc. Yet he refused to allow us to check-in. We asked him to call KLM in Holland but instead he called Air France who could not help. By this point, we had been at the customer service desk for more than an hour and a half and were unable to reach a single KLM staff member other than the passive-aggressive station manager who told us that the only way we could travel on the flight was to buy two more economy tickets (business class was full). He told us to try and book the flight online on our phones which we tried to do, having absolutely no choice to not travel (my husband's Indonesian visa meant that he had to leave Bali on the 7th, or face a hefty fine. We also had an appointment at the Indonesian embassy to get our permanent residency for Indonesia). At the same time, our phone showed that KLM was still advertising business class seats on the same flight! We tried to book those but KLM's online payment facility failed. We asked the station manager if he would let us pay for those business class seats which were still being advertised online through the customer service desk (remember we had already paid for two business class return tickets). The station manager refused to let us do that and forced us to buy two economy return tickets, for 13,501,200 RP. Our original payment for the two return business class tickets on Dec 21st was 14,340,800 Rupiah (over $1000 USD). To add insult to injury, as we were leaving the desk, we asked for a pass to the lounge to grab a quick drink and perhaps a sandwich (we'd been at the desk now for almost 2 hours). The staff said, 'you are traveling in economy'. During this process, we sent several requests for help via the KLM WhatsApp number; sending them copies of our proof of payment and booking confirmation. They did not respond for almost 2 hours and when they did, they told us that the case had been 'resolved' at the check-in desk, which of course it had not. We purchased business class tickets on Garuda to travel back from SIN. We launched a complaint to KLM. On February 18th, KLM offered us €600 euros compensation each, but on February 19th, we received the following email from KLM customer services agent  'Regarding the Denied Boarding Compensation, the legislation does not apply for trips out of Europe (DPS-SIN). Hence, I must revise what I have previously stated, and I do apologize for that. For those above reasons, this situation does not entitle you to compensation.'",,Business,Economy Class,Denpasar to Singapore,January 2021,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Denpasar,Singapore,
552,Bruce Badash,United States,2021-04-03,1,"On January 24 we booked a trip on KLM from Bergen, Norway to Barcelona, Spain, for travel on September 2. We booked long ahead of our travel dates to get a good schedule at a good price. Our trip was KLM 1188, departing Bergen at 2:10pm and arriving in Amsterdam at 3:55pm, and KLM 1675, leaving at 4:45pm, and arriving in Barcelona at 6:50pm. We expected to have a nice, leisurely morning before heading to the airport. However, on March 30, we received two emails indicating that our flights had been changed. The first email stated that we were being changed from KLM 1675 to KLM 1681, leaving Amsterdam at 8:35pm and arriving in Barcelona at 10:45pm, making it impossible to make any connection to our final destination. Our layover in Amsterdam was changed from 50 minutes (a little short, but it's what we chose) to 4 hours and 40 minutes. Then, 90 minutes later, the second email stated that we had been changed from KLM 1188 to KLM 1186, leaving Bergen at 11:35am and arriving in Amsterdam at 1:20pm. Now we were not only arriving in Barcelona quite late, but our layover was changed to 7 hours and 15 minutes. This wasn't at all what we had booked, and was the first instance of poor customer support -- and we only chose KLM on Travelocity because it met our needs, not because of a specific desire to fly that airline. Unfortunately, due to other obligations, I studied KLM's flight choices on April 2, three days later, and tried to change my flights at that time. Travelocity assisted at this point, for quite a long time, but ran into problems with KLM. I stated that the first flight was acceptable, but that we'd prefer the second flight be changed to KLM 1673, departing Amsterdam at 2:15pm. This would change our layover in Amsterdam to 55 minutes, and restore the trip duration to something very similar to our original trip. Instead, KLM decided that our original flight was most comparable (in price or class) to a flight leaving at 6:05am! They would only change our tickets to KLM 1184 leaving Bergen at 6:05, and KLM 1669 leaving Amsterdam after a 2 1/2 hour layover. (And, they charged a few dollars per ticket, extra, for the privilege of this horrible start time, and longer trip.) I was informed after the fact, by Travelocity, that I should have contacted an airline within a day of being notified of unacceptable flight changes (and I'll do so in the future!), but this wasn't my highest priority in those few days. What's most irritating, however, is that not only did KLM somehow think that changing a trip duration from less than 5 hours to more than 11 hours was ""reasonable"", but that the final resolution of moving a flight from 2pm to 6am was all that was offered. I'd heard that KLM was a decent airline, and we'll find out for ourselves in September, but this customer experience makes it very unlikely that they'll get our business for any of our future travels.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bergen to Barcelona via Amsterdam,April 2021,,,,,,,2,no,False,Bergen,Barcelona,Amsterdam

555,V Keller,Switzerland,2021-03-14,3,"I flew with KLM from Mexico City to Zurich via Amsterdam. I will go over my thoughts about the experience point by point: (1) Both the Mexico City and KLM have a mask requirement, so obviously I was wearing one, and also I had additional masks in my hand luggage. However, KLM's ground staff in Mexico City asked me if I had a mask (ignoring that I was very obviously wearing one), and when I asked to clarify, they incorrectly claimed that KLM requires FFP2 medical masks to be worn. While I did have such a mask with me, KLM does not actually have such a requirement (see https://www.klm.nl/en/information/faq/airport-on-board). In challenging times such as the COVID pandemic, it is more important than ever to know the rules and to be respectful to customers, which KLM didn't do. (2) The aircraft interior on both flight legs (Mexico City to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to Zurich) looked tired and old. The flight attendants did not seem happy about doing their job. (3) KLM Crown Lounge 25 in the Amsterdam airport had a sign that it was closed at 2 pm. My flight arrived at 3 pm and I had a connection time of almost 6 hours. (By the way, the airside hotel YOTELAIR did not have any short term stays available, and Aspire Lounge 26 only allows access three hours before a flight.) As a result, I had to walk around the airport and sit in crowded areas, which is not good in terms of social distancing. (4) On the flight leg from Amsterdam to Zurich, I was given a hand sanitizing gel only quite a while after the meal and the drink, making it useless.

It has kept the same quality for many years, and it is a great representation of Dutch efficiency and thrift. So many reasons to fly them, so many reasons not to as well! But today, I want to rant about one thing: the KLM “entertainment” system. It is indeed entertaining to see a major airline with this ridiculous selection of TV and film choices. Imagine you have flown any airline at all (ok, not Ryanair, but you know what I am talking about!): you probably get a system with at least 5-10 comedy, and as much Drama and Lifestyle and Docu options, usually a full season. Then you get at least 5-7 full “box sets” (entire TV shows). I have never seen less. For films, by my count the average is 50-70 films, with about 5-10 new films, and staples like Harry Potter or ET and things of the sort. Now, we have KLM’s entertaining system: Two episodes of of TV comedies. I kid you not. Two single episodes! Three episodes of Drama shows. Three full seasons (season 2 of the Handmaid’s Tale!). Four episodes of “lifestyle” Five episodes of “docu” (incl two KLM promotionals!) Films: 30 films total, including “children’s programme” featuring a ridiculous KLM aircraft, Docus, promotionals, etc, the highlight of which is Benjamin Button!

When I arrived at the airport in January for the return flight to New York and checked my bags I was told that I needed to pay 100 euros for my seat, at that time I had no opportunity to then change my seat assignment because that was the only bassinet seat available so I paid the 100 euros. KLM did not inform me about payment for a seat that I was assigned to and then I had no choice but to pay for the seat assignment because I was already at the airport checking in for my flight. I should have been informed in October when I was told that I needed to pay for my husband's seat assignment. I contacted KLM when I returned to NY and they responded weeks later stated that I could not be reimbursed because I wanted to sit next to my husband? My complaint was never understood and they only apologized for taking two weeks to respond to me. They also stated that ""Fares are dynamic in nature and not guaranteed. They may change quickly depending on various factors like the period of travel, seats availability, the destination, as well as the number of passengers trying to book that particular fare at the same time. The fares may increase or decrease as per the availability."" Fares increase and decrease before purchasing a flight and if there was a change in the cost of my flight I would have been notified. This experience is very disappointing since the KLM staff at the airport and on the airline were great but the customer service before and after have guaranteed that I would not fly with KLM in the future.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to New York,January 2021,2.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,3.0,1,no,True,Amsterdam,New York,

As i knew the lounges were probably closed and I didn't want to subject myself to a COVID-19 potential in a large airport for an entire day, I was obviously not at all pleased with this change. As I had bought the ticket from Air France, I called them directly and after explaining my distinct unhappiness with this change, which was a fault of the scheduling change, and not from my side, was offered another option of going with KLM instead of Delta and this would reduce my layover in Atlanta to 4 hours, so I decided to change to this option, especially since the business class flight being offered ha the same seating configuration as my original booking, which was in a configuration of 1x2x1. I specifically asked for confirmation of this and it was confirmed by the AF agent and they put me in the same seat number of 4A and I had double checked again when checking in was still accurate. When I boarded the plane in Atlanta, I was shocked and dismayed to see that the configuration of the plane was 2 - 3 - 2 instead and there was never any notification about this. They had still kept my boarding card at 4A but now there was a 4B next to me and what's worse, the entire business class section was packed with passengers, offering no social distancing whatsoever, and the person next to me had brought in a greasy back of food from one of the fast food restaurants and I had that smell with me the entire journey from Atlanta to Amsterdam, and in my clothes the remainder of the following day. Also there was no real food service, only a terrible pasta dish (economy fare) and soggy sandwich dropped on my seat later on, only served water and flight attendants literally disappeared. Upon returning home, as a Platinum member of Flying Blue, I complained a number of occasions to KLM and, each time they finally decided to respond after weeks of waiting, they persisted to blame COVID-19 for everything! They gave no excuse why COVID-19 caused an aircraft change and them not dutifully informing me, why it was so full with no social distancing possible, why no drink service apart from water was offered, and why flight attendants disappeared. I got nowhere with them and gave up finally vowing never to darken the door again with them. I had traveled to the US with Delta Airlines from Amsterdam, and they were 100X better, and they have implemented a block middle seat policy in all classes of travel to assure social distancing.

I realize that during this current climate of additional rules and regulations, staff may not be able to keep up with all the constant changes and will need to verify whether or not they do actually have a good understanding of Covid protocols and procedures for different countries but this needs to happen before inflicting their incorrect knowledge on the customer.

Having not had any sleep and checking in at 4 in the morning, I was not quite ready for this and was wondering how I had got my information so wrong. I queried it and she called someone who evidently told her she was right. I told her that this was not true and that tourist flights had begun at the beginning of October. She said I was wrong and showed me an ambiguous statement on the KLM site and then said she didn’t have time to deal with disagreements and had other people to check in. I asked for a number so that I could call KLM about it so she gave me an emergency number and shooed me away. I then realized the emergency call number only took calls after 8am. My flight was at 6am. I decided to look up government websites to show her that tourists were being admitted. I found the proof and went back to the desk. After some more telephone calls she then came off the phone to tell me that in actual fact I was right and that I could fly. I was just shocked at how easily she could say no and then say yes without even a lame apology. Very poor customer service.

At SLP airport I received a ticket to MEX and was told that for next part of my trip I should go to the KLM Check-In Desk to collect remaining tickets. My baggage at SLP was sent directly to KRK. At MEX airport I went to the KLM check-in desk. During check-in it appeared that there is some problems with my tickets - I was waiting about 1 hour to get some explanation and the person was contacting with many other people next to him and calling by phone many others. After that I received information that my reservation is OK but my tickets are not OK due to some mistakes in the system done by my travel agent who was selling ticket to me - I could not understand such explanation - how can happen that reservation is OK but tickets are NOK. And was told that if I want to travel I need to contact my travel agency to clarify or buy new tickets. It was during the night and I was during my trip with total duration about 24h. Finally I manage to contact my travel agency and to due to emergency situation the new ticket was issued - but the whole process took probably more than 2 hours.

But the same letter ""E"" was with the flight I had just before from SLP-MEX done by Aeromexico operator. I asked why it was possible to fly with Aeromexico with identical status and it's not possible with KLM - they told me - yes because it was domestic carrier but with KLM you can not. I do not know who created the problem: KLM or my travel agency - but from my point of view full responsibility is on KLM side.  Why did they confirm a day before that everything is fine - do they know what they have in their electronic systems ? - looks like that they do not know. Why the same ticket status was OK for Aeromexico and NOK for KLM.

I had a seat with extra legroom, and I and adjacent passengers had placed our empty food trays on the floor in front of us, and the stewardess demanded that I pick them up saying that she hadn’t got time to do this.

I asked her why she wouldn't let me and she said that the decision was made (she wouldn't give me a valid reason) and I couldn't argue against her. To me, this is unacceptable.

No options given except refund voucher to the value of the flight. I appreciate the problem the airlines are currently having, however: 1. KLM had a daily service to Malaysia. However, they reduced this by half in the two weeks before my flight was due to depart. Last KLM flight from Malaysia was on 28/03/2020 although both Kuala Lumpur and Amsterdam airport remained open thereafter. 2.

If KLM had allowed me to reschedule and if they had kept their daily service up to 28/03/2020, I and numerous other KLM customers could have safely travelled with KLM. 4. I am of the opinion that the reasons behind the cancellation were purely financial; KLM calculated it was cheaper to cancel the tickets outstanding rather than send aircraft to Malaysia to pick up the passengers (many of whom would have very cheap tickets). A very cynical attitude from a major aviation operator when people are understandably anxious in the circumstances.

637,M Vamarez,Finland,2020-01-20,3,"Rio de Janeiro to Helsinki via Amsterdam. I have flown to Argentina with KLM before, and I have never had to pay extra for checked luggage before. Especially considering KLM is not a low-cost carrier, I would have never expected to pay extra for checked luggage on an international flight with KLM (or with any other carrier for that matter). When I performed the reservation process, at no time did I see a clear and visible placard stating that baggage was not included in the fare. This should have, in the first place, been clearly stated when I was searching for the price of tickets through KLM. I found out that my luggage had to be paid for at Helsinki airport when I went to drop it off. Furthermore, the fact that checked luggage was not included was also not clear during the on-line check-in process (because I could have corrected it there and paid for it). This is misleading and shows poor business practices on the part of KLM, tricking their customers into viewing low fares that so not include something as basic as checked luggage. Furthermore, they charge so much for the checked luggage at the airport (€60 at Helsinki, and €76 at Cordoba), that the fare ends up being more expensive than competitors. This is quite simply a scam. Also, when I tried to check-in online, I was unable to, because neither KLM, nor the other carrier GOL would allow online check-in. This meant that I was forced to pay even more for the checked luggage at Cordoba airport because I was unable to pay for it on-line (which would have costed less).

On the long leg of our trip, we chose to pay extra for Economy Comfort class seats, which provides more leg room and greater recline. You might only get a couple of inches extra leg room, but it is surprising the difference this can make. Other than the extra leg room/greater seat recline, the service on board is the same as standard economy. The meals on the flight were very good as too was the overall cabin service. In flight entertainment was also good, with enough content to keep you entertained. In summary, our flight to Amsterdam, in Economy Comfort Class, was very good and I managed to get some sleep. Overall, I think it was well worth the extra cost. For our flight from Amsterdam to Rome, there is little to report, given that it is considered a short, domestic flight in Europe. The service was good. No in flight entertainment. A snack was served on the flight. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient. The only minor complaint was the amount of carry on luggage some passengers were allowed to carry on, meaning that most of the overhead lockers were quickly filled and some of our stuff had to placed on the floor.

In fact, I'm not someone who likes to make fuss however this incident happened to me was a true shock and turned my usual good opinion of KLM to nearly zero. The foul mouth steward who served the front seats and my aisle said 'F' word because I didn't finish my tea. This happened during the second meal KLM served, I asked for a cup of hot tea after finishing the meal but didn't finish it as I was already full. This particular steward who served my aisle took away my dish tray but returned the tea to me, so I politely thanked him and told him I didn't want the tea anymore. However, he said F*** xxx with his lips. I was completely shocked and wasn't sure what I should do at that moment. I was on the verge of asking him to repeat what he had said to me but after thinking twice, I decided to talk to the chief of cabin crew. The chief of cabin crew came and I told him what his crew member had done and he said he would talk to him. A few minutes later, the foul mouth steward came back with a little souvenir of Dutch building telling me that it was a joke with his sneaky smile on face. Instead of a sincere apology, I didn't see any remorseful from him at all. I am so angry at myself that I didn't ask for his name and the name of the chief of cabin crew.

696,Norman Brown,United Kingdom,2019-09-11,3,"KLM having changed their website earlier this year have made it very difficult for passengers to clearly understand the Terms and Conditions. Having travelled with KLM for over 15 years primarily to Cape Town and Europe have always understood that the cost of the ticket includes one checked in bag per person (23kilos) and hand baggage. My wife and I have just fallen foul of their atrocious web site after all of these years of loyal travel with them. Having travelled down to Cape Town we had to pay for a check in bag on the return flight at a cost of £60.00 in addition to the ticket. As I am a Flying Silver member I am entitled to an extra checked in bag which they refused and insisted that my wife had to pay for her bag. It transpires that many customers are falling foul of this new rule. So, anyone travelling with KLM beware. This is an unscrupulous and devious behaviour. I have spent all day complaining in writing and they now say one of the bags was one kilo over weight. But say nothing of the bag which was only 16kilos. This was never brought to our attention at check in. My combined check is 46 kilos. KLM have also reduces the on board staff making the inflight service very very slow. They have ceased the welcome on board drinks service, very welcome on a long haul flight. Reduced the standard of the food. Introduced a cost for selecting a preferred seat (standard seat) which used to be free for passengers booking ten months in advance which considering KLM have banked the money is a small reward for passengers booking early, The food quality has diminished considerably. This was not a good end to an enjoyable break. We used to sing the praises of KLM. But no longer. Having just checked our trip with KLM for February 2020, we have discovered we have no checked in baggage for the outward bound flight, but do have checked in luggage for the return flight.

KLM has done wrong by us on all parts below: On the flight April 10th 2019 from Amsterdam to Sweden my wife didn’t get any notice about that her flight was canceled until after the flight time. Then she got a new flight the day after but no stay at a hotel over the night which mainly is KLM policy. The day after on flight to Sweden her bag got stuck in transfer in Amsterdam. We called KLM about this and they said that we are entitled to 100 euros for every day the bag still was missing and that we would get back the money if we attach the receipts. One day later the bag came to us totally broken. We took pictures of the bag and sent it to KLM and asked for a refund our bag several times. The answer we got was: ""I note that you incurred additional expenses due to delay baggage. We will be pleased to reimburse the direct expenses. Additionally, in regards to your damage baggage, we would be grateful if you could send us the following supporting documents: The receipt for the cost of repair to your baggage or a written confirmation from any nearest stockiest with the following specifications: 1. The age and the current value of the damaged baggage 2. The type of damage inflicted to the bag 3. A confirmation that the suitcase cannot be satisfactorily repaired 4. The original purchase receipt for the damaged case"" Then they sent us to the same website we got this answer from. We don't have the purchase receipt and we shouldn't need it, because we didn't break it. They broke it and they should pay with the amount for a similar bag, around 100 euros. When we bought a new flight in June 2019 the website didn't work. On the website they offer a Premium package where you can change your flight without the extra fine on 150 euros and only pay for the difference in flight price. It also included the benefits of choosing the seats. I had to call to book the same flight as I tried to book on the website but on the phone they said the option to skip the fine wasn't available. I later had to change the flight and also had to pay the fine. When I tried to book the flight through the website there was an error but the money was reserved from my card. And I had to wait two business days and because of that, the ticket price raised with 200 euros. To sum everything up: KLM is a terrible company who never takes any responsibility for their actions and tries to shower their poor customers in bureaucracy instead of helping them out when they have made mistakes.

The first thing I have to tell about is the extra luggage I bought before the trip, but I couldn’t even put my small bag close to the seat. So cabin crew without an apology asked me to put it in front of the plane, but my seat was far away from there. And I was not the only one passenger who had such a problem. During the flight cabin crew asked what drinks we would like to order. To some guests they given 2 bottles of wine per person and 2 pieces of cake they prepared for the flight, for others one bottle and one cake. when we asked about the possibility to order 2 bottles what was the answer? “Excuse me, but we have limited quantity, so we can give only one per person.” Why someone of guests located close to us without any Golden Flying blue cards and so on, have more advantages than others? And also I cannot mention the behavior of cabin crew. It was not professional to treat all guests different and also I am not sure about their English knowledges.

I've had delays twice between 3-5 hours, I've been told different things by the customer service on the phone that suddenly are told different by the staff in person on the day (once I was forced to wait 13 hours in Amsterdam because of this) and just this past week I fell for their unclear advertising and was again mislead by conflicting statements by the customer service. As I checked in online for my flight, I was offered an upgrade to business class for only 89€, almost too good to be true, but as it was only a few hours before the flight, I assumed they were hoping to get rid of the seats. Just having gotten engaged and bought a house, my fiancee and I decided to spend the €178 to celebrate and get some sleep over the ocean. After we paid, however, we got business class only for the connecting 45 minute flight from Paris to Amsterdam! Not at all what originally was offered for 89€ each. We called the service number and were told it happens often, and we would get our money back when we talk to the service desk in Paris. So we flew economy over the ocean but in randomly assigned middle seats (at the back where the veggie meals had run out) and got no sleep. In Paris, they told us that the customer service was wrong and they would not give us our money back. We decided our luck was bad and we would enjoy the business class anyway, but on this small plane, the business class had seats identical to the economy, just without someone beside you. And there was a small breakfast, which we couldn't finish because the flight was so short! All in all a waste of money, and beware of ""upgrades"" that aren't what they seem!

First, staff were wandering around attaching tags to people's carry on bag that you would be guaranteed to take your cabin baggage on board as long as you stowed under the seat in front of you. Then, as people started boarding, it was chaos, as people went through boarding they were then stopped  to see if they had been tagged. This slowed everyone down even further. I decided to wait to the very end to board given I had paid extra for a seat up front (6F) and didn't want to be caught in the crush. When I did board, there was a still a queue of people waiting to board the plane. Why, because of the crazy boarding operation. When I finally boarded he plane, the captain made an announcement that passengers needed to hurry up so the plane would not miss its departure slot or we would be delayed up to 30 minutes. By the time I reached my seat, I sat down quickly. I watched passengers with children negotiating with others to swap seats so their families wouldn't be split up. And then, a father approached me to ask me to move so he could sit with his two children.  I was frustrated having paid more for my seat, having been organised months in advance, and waited until last to board the plane to avoid any issues. I was angry by his demanding nature. I said no. Then he carried on to flight attendants and created a scene. So, feeling sorry for him, I stood up, and said where do you want me to sit then. It was seat 23E. This was in between two passengers, which I hate. I had a window seat. Then when I made my way down the back, I saw an empty window seat and asked the FA if I could sit there. She was angry with me because she didn't know what was going on or why I was moving. And she said she wasn't sure if all the passengers had boarded. Fed up, I said ""You know what, I am evicted from my seat by a demanding father, I paid extra for that seat six months in advance, and now maybe I should just stand all the way to Amsterdam."" Suddenly, she said to have the window seat. I shouted this for all the plane to hear. After take off, the purser apologised profusely. I told her exactly what I thought of KLM's boarding procedure. I also told her that parents should not be demanding others move. It is up the staff at check-in to sort this out or the boarding staff or FA, not other passengers. She agreed and told me she had told him to wait until we took off given we were about to leave and his last minute arrival on the place. But he was as usual, feeling entitled. She offered me a seat in business class to compensate and went out of her way to ensure I was okay. She was lovely and very embarrassed for me. She also acknowledged that the other passenger had been totally in the wrong to do what he did. However, given the chaotic boarding operation, perhaps he was just as caught out as I was.

As I was standing around, I received an email informing me that my flight would not make the original connection to CPH and that I had automatically been re-booked onto another flight, however this meant I would miss my rail connection to Sweden. The gate staff were not able to do much, as they were only local Irish contractors and not KLM staff. The delay was progressively made later and later. The flight was almost 2 hours late and was causing great stress and worry for me about being stranded in CPH. Only suggestion was to see the transfer desk in Amsterdam, who were helpful and professional. I asked if I could be rebooked onto Oslo, but initially they said it was booked out. They had only been looking at OSL and did not even consider TRF, until I suggested it. It was a very late flight option but it was better than everything else presented to me.

The seat itself is fairly comfortable and legroom is average (I’m 175cm tall) however, KLM only provide a blanket on long haul flights, which do make trying to sleep harder. The amount of movies and shows available on the IFE is one of the best I’ve seen. While the range of shows is great, most only do have 1 episode. The huge selection and modern IFE is, unfortunately, undermined by the horrible audio quality. I’m not sure if this is true only for my seat, but there was a lot of background noise, meaning that I had to half-guess what the actors are saying (as there aren’t any English subtitles available either). Dinner was served with a choice of beef or chicken (I went for the chicken), which was a little bland in my opinion but the rest of the meal is fine.

Shortly before boarding they announce there is a technical problem. About 45 minutes later I call KLM for advice whether to rebook immediately for fear of missing the connection in Amsterdam. Person on the other end is of no help and barely understands my question. About 90 minutes after we were supposed to board, flight is cancelled and we are advised to go to counters for rebooking. While waiting in line I discover an e-mail from KLM saying they've rebooked us to an evening flight, which means delay in arrival of about 12 hours, midnight instead of noon. At the counter we are informed there are no available earlier flights and we get zero information about EU directive for compensation in case of delay, just a useless peace of paper saying they're sorry and how I can contact customer service on Twitter. We get vouchers for 10 EUR of airport food and that's it. On the evening flight there are problems as the airport system says the flight is closed and we cannot go to security, takes about 20 minutes to clear that up. Flight to Amsterdam goes smoothly and we arrive practically on the gate for the connection. Flight Amsterdam to Oslo is delayed about 15 minutes. On the way back, Oslo-Amsterdam goes well. Amsterdam to Luxembourg, they put us in the plane and announce there is a delay due to strike of Belgian air control, will take about 20 minutes, ends up taking 35, and then they discover a technical problem and call maintenance. Another good 20 minutes until they reset something, and we are good to go. Which means another 10-15 minutes plus long taxi. During lift-off, drops of water fall on my husband sitting next to the window, most likely condensate due to poor isolation on the cabin roof. Also once during the flight. First time flying KLM, two delays in a week, and one of those significant. We planned a day and a half in Oslo and this delay significantly influenced our schedule, not to mention we were horribly tired after waking up at 4 to catch the first flight and then waiting an entire day for the next one. The only reason they are getting 4/10 is that the customer service answered my e-mail quickly and said we were eligible for compensation according to the EU directive. However, had I not known my rights, KLM certainly would not have informed me of them.

Messy on boarding, very light apologies when we started to face heavy delays, scarce information, except at the very end. At  Schiphol airport, the experience shifted from average to bad. My flight got rescheduled though Atlanta, not what I wanted, with no means to change. Pretty rude, snarky people and I got a 5-euro voucher compensation for snacks.  I got to the new lounge. Icy reception from the lady at the entrance. At that point, I had reached a point of frustration where I wouldn't want to go through the KLM website. I tried as an experimental thing is there a way I could ask to talk to one of these human beings, and just share my experience (and name and ticket) via an actual conversation, so that it would end up being logged somewhere? TI had to press a button ""Other requests"" and find out that I was #3 in the queue before someone would talk to me. But since there was no actual way for anyone to identify me I  finally approached someone. Quietly and politely.

I had preciously noted that this week this flight had been delayed regularly. Inside the cabin it was extremely hot and stuffy during boarding.

Flying in business class I expected the food and service to be at least somewhat decent but was thoroughly disappointed. Not only were the stewardesses impolite but also almost shouting to each other, which got rather annoying after a short while.

Unfortunately, the flight from Rome was delayed due to factors outside of KLM's control, and we missed our connection. The KLM team were very professional and helpful. They apologised to us in person on the flight and advised us that we would be put up in a hotel overnight and rebooked onto a flight the next morning (there were no flights to Schiphol that night after our missed connection). The staff on the flight gave us instructions on how to use the appropriate self service terminals within Schiphol to obtain our vouchers for accommodation, transport and food overnight. Through the terminal at Schiphol, we were easily able to check in for our flight the next morning (already rebooked for us), select our seats, and print vouchers for a hotel stay, airport food and a shuttle bus to and from the hotel. The vouchers for food worked at the terminal and transport to the Ibis hotel was efficient and straightforward. On arrival at the hotel, there was a special check in desk for delayed KLM customers and we were served promptly and professionally, with a timetable provided for the shuttle bus the next day. Our room was pleasant and transport to the airport the next day was once again straightforward. The hotel stay even included dinner and breakfast, though we did not partake. This was my first time flying with KLM, and I am pleased to say that I was well cared for, especially when we were delayed. The cabin crew were lovely and did their best in a difficult situation.

On this occasion it was a relatively short flight from Amsterdam to Malaga with my family. Check in was speedy but no notification was given that there was an aircraft type and configuration change (already known at check-in by the way). Consequently it came as a surprise when we boarded to find that some of us had been re-assigned. One could argue that we should have checked our seat assignments at check in. My excuse is that I have never experienced an unannounced seat re-allocation in all the 20 years or so I have travelled with KLM. Advance warning of the fact would have been welcomed. Lounge was adequate. Boarding procedure reasonably adequate. Comfort factor in Business Class was no more than one can expect on European flights these days! Cabin crew friendly but lacked concentration. In a cabin of 11 passengers the Purser somehow managed to forget to serve both my wife's and my meal. These things can happen, although one can question why in such a small cabin. If we were not regulars on KLM it could have left a very poor impression of the airline to a newcomer.

When I booked the ticket, I had to pay extra for checked baggage (standard for most airlines) but KLM decided not to load the baggage onto the aircraft. This looks like a new little trick to make extra cash. Overbooking the bagage and then send it via the next flight. While we were waiting to board the aircraft, I actually saw my luggage being handled by bagage handlers, it was at the aircraft. KLM did not load my baggage, it was not by error or mistake, but by decision. Obviously I was very surprised that my baggage were ""delayed"". It took me 2 hours at the the lost baggage counter to complete the lost baggage claim form. I was traveling with two other persons, so they also had to wait. I'm not going to go into detail, but you can imagine the repercussion of this. The next day was Easter Sunday, not a single shop was open. I went to Italy to paraglide, but that's not an option if you don't have your paraglider. So in an instant my holiday was ruined. A financial loss that does not get covered by the airline or insurance. The complete lack of empathy of the customer service is amazing. Unwilling to do anything other than telling me I have to wait. Lying to me that the bagage will be delivered within 24 hours while they were fully aware it was a public holiday and nothing will be done. I offered to fetch the baggage myself at the airport, but that was too much trouble for the customer service employee to get that organised. So she just lied to me and said that it was not possible and the baggage is probably already on its way. It arrived 2 days later. I decided to file a complaint, hopeful that I could get a reason why my bagage was not loaded onto the aircraft. This is the most disgusting service I ever experienced. Basically they copy paste text from your complaint and add ""We are sorry for"" or even better ""I am concerned to read about"" in front of it. I had to ask the person to reread my complaint as their response made no sense. They offered me a 100 euro voucher which I turned down, what an insult.

Then I added one piece on top of tickets, for £60. All seemed fine, until they tell you after payment that the £60 was only for the return flight! Fair enough, so I ask to add one on the way out, and surprisingly I can't because it's a FlyBE / AirFrance flight.

A quick word about that; We only had a 1hr 25m layover in Amsterdam which leaves little margin for error and could become a stressful situation with a young child especially as we were flying in on a smaller plane which parks up away from the terminal and requires a shuttle bus to the airport.

Check-in at the airport went smooth and security check was a breeze. Decided to spend some time in the Delta SkyClub lounge but wasn't really impressed by the breakfast they had on offer. Some fruits and bread rolls but nothing fancy. The seating options and the views over the tarmac were fine though. Boarding started on time and immediately after taking my seat the purser introduced herself and offered me a welcome drink. The crew on this flight was great and everything was done with a personal touch. One hour after takeoff lunch was served and the meal was great. After lunch I was able to get a couple of hours sleep in the lie-flat-seat. Think it was pretty comfortable. A second meal could be ordered any time you liked. I decided to try the guilty pleasure burger which tasted good but unfortunately the meat was still cold. After notifying the crew it went back to the oven again and after a few minutes the burger was hot and perfectly cooked. This B777-300ER was equipped with wifi but it didn't work for most of the time, probably because we flew on a very northern lattitude.

824,J Gillams,Netherlands,2019-01-06,1,We had a flight from Oslo to Amsterdam. Because of fog at Schiphol airport the flight was cancelled. I had to take another fight from Brussels the day after and my friend had important meetings the day after. We called the call center in Amsterdam but it was too busy. We could not speak to a call center agent. We decided to immediately book a new KLM ticket for the same day but earlier. This flight was not cancelled. The tickets were 355 EUR for a very short flight. We expected KLM to refund the tickets as the call center was too busy and because of the force majeure situation. In the plane we met people that took the same flight as us but initially booked the later flight like us. They went to the airport and KLM (in fact SAS) staff booked them to the earlier flight FREE OF CHARGE. We called several times with the call center the day after but they didn't want to refund the 710 EUR. They said we had chosen ourselves to make extra costs. But for the airline (apart from credit card charges) it wasn't an extra cost at all. There were enough empty seats and we didn't take the flight the day after KLM booked us on later in the evening. They said we could try to get money back from travel insurance. They offered 2 vouchers as leniency but this was by far not the 710 EUR we had to pay for a very short European flight. Apart from the issue described my plane chair was broken and could not stand completely straight. It was a very old aircraft and they did not invest in a new chair which is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE and UNSAFE. So for a price of 355 EUR I had to sit in a broken chair. Very bad customer service and we never thought KLM was capable of doing this.

I always find their staff are cheerful, upbeat, and clearly enjoying their work; there's a real sense of fun about them, and they're always happy and willing to provide extra drinks. The cabin was recently refurbished, and was stunning: bright, airy and light - it felt really spacious, modern and minimalist. The legroom was spacious, the seats comfortable, and the IFE screens large and crystal-clear. The selection of entertainment was good.

Having worked with service myself I am always very carefully to treat service personnel with respect, and in return I expect to be respected as a passenger. After an unpleasant encounter with one of the ground staff in Amsterdam I felt incredibly uncomfortable and disrespected. I was required to check in my hand luggage as the flight was fully booked, as this would mean further delays for me I kindly asked if perhaps would have been possible for me to bring my hand luggage on the flight. The lady behind the counter told me no, without additional expressions such as ""unfortunately"" or ""I am sorry but..."". She then threatened to rebook my flight. When I told her that I had already been delayed and that it would not be possible for me to catch a later flight she replied with ""that is not my problem"". When I told her that I would try to repack my bag, according to her own instructions, she once again threatened to rebook my flight, despite me having told her no once already. She phrased this as a threat rather than a kind suggestion. I understand that she was tired and that her understanding of English was limited.

Ground staff were abrupt and unhelpful when asked a question and cabin crew even worse! I asked a cabin crew for some hot water with lemon slice and she was extremely abrupt and rude. I heard same cabin crew tell another passenger that he would have to wait to go to his seat as she had her drinks cart out (understandable of course and passenger wasn't asking her to move, but patiently waiting his turn); however she asked him if he expected to ""jump"" over the cart! Each leg of our flight contained a one or two cabin crew who were dismissive and cold - we kept hoping we would meet a friendly crew as we took 4 flights with KLM- but alas no!

My flight was originally meant to leave at about 8:25 pm today but because they overbooked people on this flight they downgraded me to economy class without my knowledge. I complained to the agent about my seat not being what I booked and paid for. They made me leave that airplane to sort out the issue all by myself. I spoke to one of the KLM agents and showed her my itinerary at the airport gate - who told me they were overbooked while another agent rebooked me on a business seat on another flight leaving tonight at 10:30pm after so much confusion and frustration. I called the customer service number and the Lady was nice but on getting to the lady supervisor on the phone with a three way call, she was rude, insensitive, inhumane to my plight for help after I and my wife explained the situation to her. All she kept saying was my flight was not confirmed and she can not help me even after the gate KLM agent told me it was due to overbooked flight. She went on to say the flight the KLM airport agent gave me would not work because she can not see it on the computer and she refused to talk to the airport agent at any time to resolve the issue after explaining to her the need to...so they could discuss their findings on their individual klm computers. My question to KLM corporate is why do some KLM clients have to go through so much stress and why did they choose me to be downgraded, inconvenienced and embarrassed? I would have appreciated if someone explained to me honestly what was going on instead of some KLM staff especially the supervisor being so so so nonchalant about the situation. However, I would like to commend the last KLM customer service rep my wife spoke to tonight on the phone. He was empathetic and understanding. I am really disappointed with the lady supervisor who did not make any attempt to understand the issue, not to talk about even resolving the issue. I am really disappointed with KLM as a whole and some agents do need to be retrained in dealing with issues at hand.

841,Kim Wheeler,United Kingdom,2018-11-23,1,"London to Jakarta via Amsterdam. It’s been a week now since I left the UK. First organising the dogs at Heathrow was a nightmare, four large bags, two large crates and two worried dogs did nothing to help my stress levels and then you add the complete incompetence of KLM that gradually got worse and worse. Iit took 5 hours to get the dogs and myself thru security and check in, had to buy a bigger crate for Bluebell and then the debacle of 'unsure if they can travel now as one crates much bigger than the other one, which only made their first comment of 'oh you have two different sized crates' slightly less irritating, all organised while standing in the middle of Heathrow as the world watched with eager if not a tad annoying interest. I landed at Amsterdam in near hysterics, almost lost it with the KLM staff who gave not one jot of help. I also had nowhere to go as I was told my next flight wouldn't be until the next day at 10am and where’s my dogs? I demanded again and again, finally I heard they were in a pet hotel (which apparently is good, but that didn’t really help my anger. Remember this was business class, I expected something a bit better, no I expected a whole lot better) but that didn’t change my rage. I was then told to 'go out of airport get a shuttle bus to such and such where there is a hotel' - this was when I completely lost it - apparently KLM are supposed to organise all of that rather than leaving this man with four heavy bags in the middle of an airport. I found a hotel in the airport and tried to relax, some hope, then woken at 5am with the phone ringing and a voice telling me, 'that my flight had been cancelled as they didn’t take dogs, next flight 18.00'. Then KLM rang an hour later saying last flight been cancelled and my new flight 20.50. 'How are my dogs, nobody seemed to know or care. So if you are thinking of traveling great distances with your beloved pets, think one hundred times before you make this decision, KLM have offered some apology and some money back, which I find insulting but I will take it.

843,Fionn MacKillop,United Kingdom,2018-11-19,6,"Overall this is a bit of a disappointment I have to say. I upgraded with SkyTeam miles (89,900 miles to be precise) from Buenos Aires to Amsterdam (my full itinerary was Santiago de Chile-Edinburgh, but only the previous segment got upgraded). I have been a customer of AF/KLM for well over 10 years, and have never been offered an upgrade or anything, which I believe says a lot about how they value their loyal customers. For this upgrade, I had to repeatedly ask the purser on Santiago-Buenos, then ground staff, before finally getting an answer! Which is still better than when you ask on Messenger or WhatsApp, and they just say 'no' without any kind of explanation--this also needs improving. Anyway, preamble over and onto the product itself. I was in seat 1 C, which had a not very charming view of a corridor leading to the flight deck, past the kitchen etc. There was also some foot traffic around here. There are only 2 toilets for the whole of Biz class on this plane, this is too little as there were queues, and also the toilets are no different from Economy, I believe they should have special touch to justify the increased cost. The seat had some pros, one being turning into lie-flat bed and various other comfy positions; there was a 17 inch IFE screen, but I didn't use it. The blanket was warm enough, and the pillow of good size. I did find the seat a bit dirty (lots of crumbs on the side) and scuffed in some areas. There was also too little storage space (I like having phone, tablets, headphones etc. in easy reach and there was barely enough space for that). The most annoying is the absence of direct aisle access, meaning the person next to you has to step over you or wake you up to get to bathroom etc. This is a big minus in terms of convenience/privacy. The staff were generally helpful, friendly and efficient, though they should come by more often to offer drinks etc. I got extremely dehydrated at one point. The food I'd say was average: a starter of prawns was tasty (though very few prawns!), while the beef mains was chewy and bland; the dessert was dry, and the cheese selection was very limited and not that tasty. There were some good wines (though a limited range), a very tasty cocktail (but awful, dry and not fresh nuts!). The breakfast was certainly better than in economy but a bit so-so too. Coffee was tasty enough. Good touch in terms of cutlery and crockery design, especially the Delft porcelain-style mugs and bowls, very pretty. The little present a Dutch house model filled with Gin, to take home and collect (there are 99 in total) is a sweet touch. Overall, I would keep my miles and spend them on a better business class. I slept poorly due to heavy turbulence (not their fault of course!) and an overheated cabin.

Its basic but comfortable enough and I even prefer it to the flagship T1 lounge. Boarding had commenced when I reached the gate but there was a “Sky Priority” lane for all business class passengers. Once onboard a hot towel and selection of drinks (inc champagne) were offered. We were served two meals – dinner right after taking off and breakfast before landing. Dinner service was efficient so that passengers can catch up some sleep. The crew walked around often to refill champagne and wine which was appreciated. Breakfast was standard quality but after breakfast the crew came out with champagne and it was a nice touch. Overall the service was efficient and faultless although not as personal. Seat on KLM was actually very comfortable. I had a window seat and luckily the seat next to me was not occupied otherwise it would have been a task to step over the neighbour to go to the toilet.

We bought the flight tickets for us both 8 months before the wedding and immediately asked KLM customer service if we could transport the wedding dress with us on board (it couldn't be sent as a luggage, because a) it would be destroyed and b) it could go missing because we had to change planes on our way). Customer service answered that yes, it's not a problem, we just need to send the exact dimensions of the dress a few days before the flight. We sent this information 3 weeks before our flight - and then it turned out that our request to take the dress has been denied because it was ""too big"". Of course before no one informed us that they would accept it just if it fits to a given sizes! Very upset and angry, we decided to buy an extra seat for the dress (which, because the flight was so already so close, turned out to be more expensive than the tickets for both of us together!) And then our request was denied once more. The reason: the dress is TOO FRAGILE. They suggested we put it into the luggage. You see, it was too fragile for onboard but apparently not too fragile to be sent with the luggage even though everyone knows how the airlines treat your luggage! Then we told them it's ridiculous and sent the request for buying the extra seat again, and again we were denied! This time they said that the dress is ""too big"" (even though it was smaller and much lighter than e.g. musical instruments, which KLM allows to transport!) We have requested again and again have been denied that it's too big and then we requested again, promising that we gonna bend it three times, so it will be smaller (which of course we were not going to do, because then the dress would be completely destroyed!) - and then finally we were allowed to buy our overpriced seat. Of course, when we were actually flying, the crew was surprised that we had been forced to buy an extra seat - because they were immediately offering us space in the storage closet, which we had requested at the very beginning! And of course no one was trying to force us to bend the dress and of course the dress fit the seat perfectly and wasn't disturbing anyone. What I do not understand, is: what do the people who make such decisions at KLM have against weddings? Why did they force us to go through all that unnecessary stress just before our wedding? The crews and the people from the customer service were really nice - why some decision making clerk, hiding behind the firewall of the customer service, was trying to make our life so unnecessarily miserable?

849,Kah Kay Au,Singapore,2018-11-12,9,"Rio de Janeiro to Amsterdam. The business class on KLM’s B787 Dreamliner is configured in a 1-2-1 arrangement in reverse herringbone layout. I had the window seat 2A. As the seat is angled facing the window, there is a lot of privacy in the window seat. Even in upright mode, a person of average height like myself at 178 cm is able to rest my legs on the ottoman. There is a small storage compartment at the side with a vanity mirror which comes in useful when you want to style your hair after waking up from sleep. A 3-course dinner was served shortly after takeoff from GIG. I opted for the cream of sweet potato soup which was delicious. For the main course, I had the grilled chicken with quail risotto. It was something unusual but nevertheless tasty. Courses were served course by course and the entire dinner service took almost 2.5 hours before I was able to recline into bed mode for a restful 6-hour sleep before breakfast. It was a very pleasant experience and do hope that KLM will have more aircraft with the reverse herringbone configuration in business class. This aircraft was wifi enabled. However it was rather costly at €10 per 50MB and speed was just about adequate.

They said they would fly it to the nearest airport to me instead. Then they sent it back to Amsterdam in order to send it to the nearest airport, and now they said they weren’t sure I would receive it today either. I am on holiday for two days, and I basically have no clothes and equipment for the activities I prepared. There are no stores nearby either.

856,M Jalena,United States,2018-10-24,9,"This was a Delta flight operated by KLM. I upgraded to business from economy for around $500 at the gate. I was a bit disappointed to find out that the equipment had been changed from a Boeing 787  to a 777 however I was looking forward to the KLM business experience. If you have Air France points always ask because the original price to upgrade was around $900 however just for being a member of the Air France loyalty program, the price dropped down to a little bit under $500 and I did not have to use points. Keep in mind you have to ask and hopefully find an agent that is nice enough to do it for you. Upon boarding, it was obvious that the 777 was old however it was well-kept. The bathroom was very nice and had Dutch themed wallpaper with all kinds of amenities inside. They serve you a hot meal that includes an appetizer,  entrée, and everything you can drink every two hours. They use beautiful china, glass, nice silverware, and beautiful linen napkins. Two hours before landing they serve you a  hot breakfast. They also give you a nice little Dutch themed ceramic house with liquor inside as a  gift which I thought was a lovely touch and your choice of chocolate. The seat was large, very comfortable, and with plenty of storage. The  amenity kit however was quite basic. It included a pair of poorly made socks, something to cover your eyes that resembled a mask, earplugs, only flimsy toothbrush with a tiny bit of toothpaste, all inside a cheap looking zipper bag that looked like a coin purse. Needless to say after using a few items inside I left it on board. There was no Wi-Fi on this flight and the entertainment options were decent for a 7 hour flight. Overall I have always been a fan of KLM they do it right whether you are in coach or in business, I would fly them every  time if I could.

Lie number 1. I booked the ticket and went to book seats online. I could book KLM seats but not partner (the message on screen said seating plan is currently unavailable try later) - Lie number 2. I called after booking to reserve seats and was told I needed to do this with Etihad, I called Etihad and they said it wasn’t possible and I needed to do this with KLM or at the airport: meaning that I would get whatever seat was available 3 hours before the plane would leave - for an 8 hour and a 14 hr flight that’s just not acceptable - and certainly not like for like with KLM operated flights. When I complained I was told I could cancel my flight at a cost. In the time taken going backwards and forwards between the many KLM service departments other flight costs had risen significantly and I was trapped. After this experience on the way out I asked about upgrades I couldn’t use points for the KLM part and I couldn’t pay for the Etihad part my option was to upgrade to business class which cost more than the original ticket. I have done many long haul flights with various operators - KLM included - some code share some not. I am now sat at the airport waiting for the check in desk to open, I tried on the KLM app where it was not possible, they advised to use the self service at the airport - that’s not possible. So I’m sat here until the desks open, thank you KLM. This is not as described when I specifically asked this stuff before booking.

I chose to fly with KLM via AMS, with the return journey via CDG - by TGV train to CDG and onward with Flybe (Air France flight number). I made my booking with Expedia. Basically, everything was fine. The flights via Amsterdam were fine but the connection time was a bit tight because of passport control. The return journey was fine - Strasbourg station check-in was excellent, as was the TGV - I shall definitely consider TGV connections via CDG again. However, FlyBE is an experience I do without. Late. Appalling on board catering which they have the cheek to charge for. The flights to AMS and Strasbourg offered acceptable food and drink for free and the service was very correct. What did surprise me was the 40 Euro per checked bag fee in each direction. The Expedia site did not give a warning of this and it was not clear from the ticketing documentation - it came as a surprise at check-in.I hace flown a couple of thousand times and consider myself a seasoned traveller, I know that such fees are common with budget airlines like Ryanair, Easyjet and some US domestic airlines, but I have never experienced this with established airlines like KLM or AF, I normally fly Star Alliance (LH, TK, LX) or Aeroflot. So I was unpleasantly surprised. This represented a hidden charge of ca 30%, and it was not at all clear in the booking process.

The second leg in particular was very attentive, proactive staff, who addressed passengers by name, and were generous with drinks and food. KLM has great tableware, and all of the meals were pretty good too. Their amenity kits leave a lot to be desired (no skin care) but little touches - like coming around with a box of chocolates, offering plenty of snacks, and the gift of the gin-filled Delft house - really make up for it. IFE was good - they often have an interesting selection, and not just mainstream blockbusters.

On this particular flight I was traveling for business from Europe to the East Coast and my luggage never arrived. I had a conference to attend on Wednesday evening when I landed which I missed because I had to go buy work clothes. My conference ran through Thursday and I am lucky that I bought more than one outfit because my bag didn’t arrive until Friday even though I was told my bag would arrive the next day! Every time I called the baggage claims department it would take an hour to even speak to anyone. When my bag finally did arrive it was damaged and missing a wheel.  I had to submit two claims one for reimbursement of the clothes I bought and another for my damaged bag. A check was finally received a month later for my damaged bag but to this day I am still waiting to receive a check for the clothes.,,Business,Economy Class,Budapest to Boston via Amsterdam,June 2018,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Budapest,Boston,Amsterdam

The flight was fully booked but everything worked well and the crew had the nice touch of addressing passengers with their names. Selection of drinks and food was good, and can't be complained at all. The new seats fold fully flat and are spacious, though lacking in storage space (apart from overhead bins). IFE had a reasonable selection of movies and the ability to play multiplayer games against another passenger (like Yatzee) was fun. I was missing the aircraft (outside) camera options from IFE but I assume B787 does not have this option in the way for example A350 has...

In this morning flight there were no newspapers, their bubbly wine was of the cheapest possible kind (Codorniu, vs. actual champagne served by some airlines, and KLM longhaul), and the breakfast options ran out when they got to row 2 already (though the food I got was still okay, just nothing to choose from).

888,Kimberley Fijman,Thailand,2018-08-17,4,"Amsterdam to Bangkok. Whilst the flight was boarding and I was in my seat I noticed a sickening Sweaty feet smell. Someone had taken of their shoes and the smell was horrendous. I was trying to figure out where it was coming from. After take off when I got up to go to the toilet I saw the lady sitting behind me holding a tissue covering her nose and mouth. The man in 60b next to her was the one were the bad smell came from. I went to speak to the purser and told her the situation and she told me she had smelt it too but also didnt know where it was coming from. I asked her if she could please do something. She basically giggled and said ""what do you expect me to do or say about it"" that is not how you deal with a problem, especially not when you are a customer service manager. (they get trained for these situations) She went to the man and told him carefully about the smell and asked him ""could you please put your shoes in a plastic bag"" and left it at that. It didn't make it any better as the smell was coming from his dirty feet and socks too! After about 20min the smell still hadn't gone and when the purser walked by I told her that it still smells really bad. She said ""the gentleman had put the shoes in a plastic bag"" when I said it is not only his shoes that were the problem but also his socks and feet she basically gave me an angry look and walked away not to been seen for the rest of the flight. I among others were forced to sit in this smell for 10.5 hours from take off till landing. This is unacceptable. I felt super bad for the Thai lady behind me in 60a as she was squashed in her seat as the man was also very big and showed no consideration for her space plus the smell was even more unbearable for her. I think the way the purser went about it was ridiculous. She should have asked him to put his shoes back on and show a little bit more customer care. It is a long haul flight and to sit in that smell for that amount of time is unacceptable, especially if you have paid almost 900 euros for a ticket. I am very disappointed with this service. To make matters worse, after they served breakfast about 1.5 hours before landing the lady in 59c next to me started vomiting. I was handing her more sickbags from other seat pockets. In this time flight attendant walked by and didn't ask the poor woman if she was okay when she was clearly sitting with a sickbag on an aisles seat in full view of the crew passing by. I must say this has been the worst flight I have ever had. I am very disappointed in the lack of care of the crew and ground staff.

891,Paul Beardshaw,United Kingdom,2018-08-10,4,"Birmingham to Minneapolis via Amsterdam. When an airline has so many lost luggage claims that after 45 days, your claim still hasn't been started, you have to ask yourself ""Is KLM the right airline to fly with?"". I have no complaint about the the planes, the staff or the on board experience, they're all pretty good. Where this airline fails is when they delay your flights because of missing catering, lose your luggage, smash that luggage and I lost some valuables. All of this happened to me in one flight. Trying to get their customer care team to acknowledge my claim and begin the investigation is proving to be more difficult than landing a vehicle on Mars. The day after I arrived back, my luggage arrived at my house and it was broken beyond repair, and missing several items.  As I write this, it's been 45 days since I made first contact about this, and my claim is still sitting in a pile of claims, waiting to be started. Each time I call, my claim is being ""escalated to a manager"", only to find out the next time I call that this didn't happen. I've had every excuse available and not their staff hang up when I call. I have to use my colleague's mobiles so the support team does not recognise my number. If you are planning to book with KLM, only do so if you are only taking hand luggage with you, and you're prepared never to make a claim against the airline for anything else because, it's highly unlikely they will process your claim.

It was much more responsive than other IFE systems that I have used recently and the remote is touch screen which helps a lot. The food was respectable for such a short flight, with two choices for the main, either chicken or beef with all the trimmings. Altogether when the salad and desert it was very tasty and the crew kept filling up drinks and offering bread rolls. I was surprised to get a meal on this flight but I was glad I did.

In the end such hand luggage didn't reach the final destination and since the ticket on the suitcase was handwritten (done onboard as explained). I really doubt it will ever get back to destination.

Eventually, we did continue our trip after a lot of welcome help from Delta and a lot of personal cost borne by us. The true worth of an airline shows up when things do not go to script. KLM showed that it has neither the technology, nor the process, or the people to operate as a customer-oriented international airline in the 21st century. Shame on you, KLM, for not taking accountability for your deficiencies and for putting us through hell. KLM does not deserve to be on SkyTeam, and in fact should go extinct just like the 747s it continues to fly from US to Amsterdam or its time honored tradition of skimping on meal service.","Boeing 747, Boeing 777",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Cape Town via Amsterdam,June 2018,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Chicago,Cape Town,Amsterdam

During my online check-in at KLM websites I was also invited to “choose seat for free”. Just to learn, such a choice is in fact not available for me, given Moscow lag is operated by Aeroflot. Puzzled, I asked why it cannot be done given both KLM and Aeroflot are members of SkyTeam alliance. I learned that this is due to the fact that the respective systems are not interconnected as yet and ""choose your seat"" therefore no option. Expression ""as yet"" sounds real pathetic, given KLM is member of SkyTeam for already 14 years and Aeroflot for 12 years.

In Amsterdam I could use the Skypriority facilities allowing me to skip the lines for security. Both flights were typical KLM short haul service operated by a KLM Boeing 737-800. On board service consists of a pre-packed sandwich and a drink of choice. The flight was 20 minutes delayed partly due to the late arrival of the aircraft and partly due to air traffic constraints over France. We arrived only 5 minutes late. Less pleasant was the 45min queue in front of the French border police. (Remember that France and The Netherlands are both founding members of the Schengen treaty). During the flight I have been consequently approached in English, even when I returned in Dutch! When returning at Lyon airport I found out there was a power cut at the airport. There was a long queue of passengers who could not be checked in. Security was closed. The Air France ground crew has done all they could fixing the issue and after a while all passengers were moved from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1B where we could pass security and head to a new gate. At the gate the airbridges did not work and all passengers had to embark after a short walk over the tarmac. Boarding was done manually by checking each passenger on a list. At the end we left 30 minutes late. The AF ground staff did a great job, considering there were no computers and no PA systems available. The return flight was operated by KLM Cityhopper EMB 190, a full flight with only 2 enthusiastic flight-attendants.

It cost us an extra £92 on top of the flight which was already more expensive than other airlines. The flight was due to land at Leeds at just after 10pm. However the flight took off and then due to a technical issue had to return to Amsterdam. This is ok but no-one informed us of this, then after waiting we heard the flight the cancelled. Again no one called to say our son was safe, the chaperone we heard took our son to the KLM lounge and left him there with the lounge staff, neither the chaperone or the lounge staff thought to use the big folder around the child's neck to call the parents. Therefore we were running around Leeds trying to find out what was going on. We had called family in Amsterdam whom had return to the airport to see what was going on there also but no-one knew. Eventually at 01.30 we tracked him down to the KLM lounge. KLM never offered any apology or a hotel as thy are supposed to. Why didn't the chaperone or lounge staff call us. To me this is nothing more than neglect. KLM took 2 weeks to answer my email of complaint and then took 2 more to come back with an offer of the flight payment up to £250 plus £92 for the service and £100 family day if we paid for it first and sent them the receipt. The way they have been with us I am not sure they would do this so wouldn't spend that extra money on the off chance. I believe this is totally unacceptable as we are entitled by eu law for the flight money back so they for company like this to offer a £100 voucher for child neglect just goes to show how much emphasis they put on childrens well being.

974,F Gan,United Kingdom,2018-01-13,8,"Amsterdam to Cape Town. After a rushed flight from Nice to Amsterdam we were left with only 45 minutes, but I  wanted to have a freshen-up in the lounge. The airport is chaotic, but the KLM lounge was worse. I have never seen so many people in such a crowded space. You can’t find any decent seats and then there isn’t any space between chairs. After a quick coffee and a toilet break we left for the boarding gate. Well, even worse - there is a long queue for passport control. When we got to the gate it was already boarding time. The 777 was ok. Slightly angled seats with a tiny tiny foothold. I am 5.6 and my feet barely fit in it. When flat the bed is comfy but one has to angle ones feet sideways. The blanket is soft and warm. Service was very efficient but at times I couldn’t find any staff. Since it was a daylight flight I had to watch TV and eat. Food wasn’t great - beef curry was a reconstituted shredded beef without any flavour. The other choices were worse. Drinks were good. The pre-arrival snack was a dec3nt hamburger but it was cold. The amenity kit was poor - worse than most economy class. Just a pair of sock, toothbrush and toothpaste. And an eyeshade. We had a 1.5 hour delay due to a technical issue, which is not the airline’s fault, but still, they didn’t give us any drinks or snacks until after an hour. All in all, KLM has a lot to catch up on, even just within its group, to Air Feance’s standard. We flew AF in March, also business class, and it is a much superior airline. The French has a flair for service and food, while the Dutch has efficiency. Well, in this competitive age of world travels, I’m afraid efficiency is not enough to woo customers back.",Boeing 777-200ER,Business,Business Class,Amsterdam to Cape Town,January 2018,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4,yes,True,Amsterdam,Cape Town,

Admittedly the flight originated in Amsterdam so there was always the chance the arriving flight would be late. This proved to be the case and we left Singapore almost forty minutes late. The configuration of two seats by three per row (thirty seats per cabin) is ideal and there is plenty of leg room and the seats very comfortable.

You may find yourself in a position of receiving a email or notice on KLM's app that you can upgrade to a economy comfort or business class seat for anything between 50 Euros to 500 Euros. A word of warning if you do. 1- If you upgrade from your original seat and pay between 50 Euros to 500 Euros for the upgrade and then have your flight cancelled KLM will rebook your flights back to the original seat class only with no automatic refund on your upgrade. You have to go through a 2 week refund process which you have to initiate by applying for first with no guarantee of a refund at the end! You will be told ""the reason we could not rebook your upgraded seat is because these are not available on your rebooked flight"". But when I logged on to KLM's website or App I notice that the upgraded seats are still available. Only this time they are substantially more expensive to upgrade to, because they know that there are more people willing to upgrade because of the cancelled flights. If like me you check the upgrade as soon as you get your ticket and find the highest upgrade available is a economy comfort seat and you pay for that upgrade as soon as you can you may find yourself in a sticky situation if business class becomes available closer to departure time and you upgrade further. Because, and I quote a customer services rep on the phone ""It is KLM's policy not to refund any earlier upgrade to economy comfort if you then upgrade to business class"". KLM has already failed to honour your original upgrade from the day before, failed to give you a automatic refund and will keep your money for 14 days and then hiked the price of that upgrade to around $100 more for the same flight the next day. And now are refusing to give a refund for a lesser upgrade booked earlier which has been superseded by paying the premium price for business class upgrade. All in all KLM are  not customer focused and are only focused on your money, making it easy for you to hand over and hard for you to get back if anything goes wrong. Whilst flying out of Dammam we have had our flight delayed (above flight) due to fog, we watched as all the other airlines gave their passengers information, hotel, transport as it was very clear that we would not be leaving that night. It took KLM 15 hours to get their passengers out of the airport, and still we were not given any information. We were told by the KLM business lounge rep "" I will cancel your exit stamp and you can go and sort yourself out until the next flight"".

Though the first flight had a delay and we hardly arrived on time at the connecting flight to Amsterdam, the ground staff reopened the gate and let us in. At Amsterdam Schiphol airport there was bad weather so there were a lot of passengers coming late. Unfortunately our baggage did not make it in time which I totally understand considering the circumstance of a connecting time below 20 min. When we arrived in Tokyo Narita the ground staff already prepared a baggage loss claim form with our names on it and informed us that the baggage will probably arrive the next day but latest the day after the next day. So we went shopping to get some necessary clothes for the next day, assuming that the baggage will arrive soon. I got e-mails, facebook, whatsapp and sms notifications that the baggage is already on the flight to Tokyo-Narita. The next I called the ground staff to ask for any news and they could not say anything specific, but called back a few hours later to inform us, that our baggage will arrive in the evening between 5 and 10 pm at the place in Tokyo, where we stayed. About half past 6 the baggage arrived. Excellent. Then I filled in the compensation form for the clothes I had to buy, and got a response within 2 days that the total cost of about 110 EUR will be refunded within 2-3 weeks. With Etihad I am still waiting after more than 1 month for any response for the reimbursement after I had a flight cancellation with a nightmare experience. With KLM I  felt that all the people are very concerned about any detail that is relevant for the passenger experience. Problems always arise at some point but how an airline company deals with it, makes a difference. From a passenger perspective, I really don't know, what they could have done better. The ticket price was also very competitive, especially considering that I booked 2 days in advance. It was the second inexpensive option and the connection with the shortest travel time.

I have now experienced it for the second time that a flight has been cancelled due to bad weather conditions and KLM just did not manage to provide any support. There is a busy hotline and the fact that you may miss your original connection once bad weather hits is totally understandable. The way how KLM reacts to this, however, is incredibly bad. In both cases, the airline sent an e-mail telling us that they would contact us within the next three hours, but in fact, they never (not even after two days) write or call back. You cannot reach the hotline (you get disconnected after one hour of waiting) or their Whatsapp support. When I tried to re-book online (which they offer for free under these conditions and advice you to do in their cancellation e-mail), the online-system aborts the re-booking process and displays a random error message. What worked for me last time is to book a flight with another airline and ask for a ticket refund at KLM. In sum, the airline just dumped me and didn't manage to provide any support.

On November 30st around 7pm, so just a few hours before the flight I checked my e-mail (I was lucky because I checked them already a few hours before and didn’t see any KLM e-mail) and saw a mail by KLM saying that my flight has been cancelled and that I have been booked on a flight at 1.35pm on December 1st! So what? Is this even legal? My husband (booked on the same flight) called KLM and because we had to be home within noon on December 1st, they booked us on a Emirates flight via Dubai on 9pm on November 30st. We almost didn’t make it to the check in, couldn’t get seats next to each other anymore. So how is this working: they just send a mail, hoping people are just accepting the change? How about plans, unbooked hotels etc - if I hadn’t checked my mails, where we supposed to sleep on the airport? How about plans when getting home?

1004,Daria Mejnartowicz,Poland,2017-11-27,1,"Warsaw to Accra via Amsterdam. The plane from Warsaw was late so I had to hurry up to catch my flight to Ghana in Amsterdam. Very short time for transfer. During boarding to Accra I told the staff that its very important to fly with my luggage and asked them to reassure its packed to the plane. They replied me they would do it for me. I boarded the plane with trusting them. They delayed my luggage (4 bags 23 kg each). I did not know when I would get it back so had to book the hotel in Accra instead of going by the car directly to Kumasi after landing. I went to Ghana during my time off from work. Delaying my luggage ruined my trip! The third day I had to buy some aids to be able to start my work with kids. Meantime I had to struggle with organizing picking my luggage up from the airport as I was in Kumasi when it finally arrived. They did not organized delivery to Kumasi. I involve few people to help me with my challenge. They called the airport every few hours, they were looking for somebody we can trust to pick my luggage up. I paid for the man who came at the airport to do that instead of me, he passed the bags to the bus to Kumasi, I also paid for the taxi to the place I stayed near Kumasi. Etc. I had to buy items like clothes, shoes, cosmetics, drops, etc. I had to buy to use as I landed just in pair of jeans, trainers and jacket. I did not know when my luggage would be with me. I wrote a letter of complaint to KLM. Attached about 10 invoices for the items I had to buy. KLM replied me after one week. They decide to pay me only 100 EUR compensation. For delaying 4 bags! I had to organize by myself picking the bags up and delivery to different city and paid a lot for that. I did not agree with their decision. But they are not going to change their mind. Its very sad and unfair how they treated me in a very challenging situation. No empathy. No sense of responsibility. I learnt the lesson.

Flew KLM in 2013 and noted that 4 years later in 2017 KLM new Y seat of B777-300ER is narrower than the seats of 2013 and there was no footrest anymore which makes the long range travel less comfortable. But new excellent IFE with more choices of music and movies in several languages. Cabin crews were aged but very friendly, professional and enthusiasm throughout the flight. One hour after taken off hot towel was given before serving lunch. Quantity and quality of lunch in 2017 was average of Y class standard. After lunch duty free sales with great selections at attractive price (cheaper than Airport Bangkok). Unlike other airlines after lunch and duty free sale most of crews were still on duty and came often with soft drinks and ice cream during the rest time. Before landing at AMS we got 1 cold meal. After landing KLM crews still on “enthusiasm service” helping passengers took out the cabin baggage/ saying thank you and goodbye with smiles. Negative points compare with 2013 is narrow seat and food/beverage. In 2017 we got only 1 hot meal (lunch) and 1 cold meal (snack) for 12 hours flight compared with 2 hot meals (Lunch & Dinner) in 2013 but KLM’s enthusiasm cabin crews made these 2 negative points quit. Transit at Amsterdam is easy and convenience as always. On AMS-HAM short leg with better service than other European airlines.

If things go wrong, you face an upward battle against limited options (flights), limited resources (costumer services, customer assistance). I paid 1700 euro for a comfort seat and they left me stranded in Amsterdam. No duty of care to be sure that I reach my final destination from the KLM side. Out the door the EU legal requirements.  The plane out of Houston has an issue, KLM needs to get it fixed. Paperworks and repairs take 4 hours. Most passengers already miss the connecting flights before departure. Staff at the gate scare people away which see the issues coming because of their prior experiences. Before we fly, they have to get some drunken passengers of the plane including the one sitting next to me. Not even a Sorry Sir. Service degree as in nineties, AC dripping, cold all night, no new water bottle - I will fill it up for you Sir (really in comfort). Inflight entertainment system bad, no subtitle, breaks down and restarts issues etc. We get to Amsterdam. The whole 747 with connecting issues floods the service desk. They get annoyed by the passengers frustration, this situation ends up being hostile at the desk. The staff is well aware that due to end of holiday week KLM basically has no options  to offer passengers. Air France is full, KLM flights are full, Speed train are full (see later train desk told me). They give me a regular train ticket. While waiting the same women as at the gate reiterates her problem of meeting her connection to the river cruise in Basel. I suggest to call Lufthansa desk immediately as the only option to meet her deadline. The Service women all get hostile towards me. While the train ticket system breaksdown again, I notice the KLM assistance going in the Lufthansa option eventually. I get a train ticket no date no hour only a destination. The service assistant write down the departure time of the train by hand. Insists seat is numbered and I need to make it on time. I file a claim for my luggage and hope to meet my train.

My customer journey with KLM left an incredible impact that marketing specialists can only dream of. It kept going on for over a month longer than my actual journey with KLM and created a number of lasting memories. The actual journey, however, never quite unfolded its full potential like a butterfly that's stuck in his cocoon. What a shame, I've heard many others say that KLM is a great airline. I can only verify this partially as out of the 4 flights I booked with KLM, I ended up only taking one. Here is why: One day before my departure from Berlin to Osaka, I received news that my connecting flight from Amsterdam to Osaka was cancelled. During the darkest hours of the night, some courageous customer service worker managed to put me on a Finnair flight which turned out to be a more than decent replacement. However, my chance to experience the Dutch Air Hospitality that KLM is renowned for was delayed. Talking about delayed, let me tell you the story of my flight home. The long haul from Osaka to Amsterdam was the only one out of the 4 KLM flights that I ended up taking. Once you manage to actually catch a KLM flight that's not cancelled, you receive warm and friendly service by the crew, decent-tasting food and a wide range of the latest cinematic enterainment options plus games and series. They even had some automatic kind of window blinds that turned the windows into a dark shade of blue (instead of the typical plastic blinds you get). This was very nice. I only wish I'd stayed up in the air for longer because as soon as we touched down in Amsterdam Schiphol, the chaos resumed. My flight to Berlin-Tegel was cancelled and I had to search for a replacement along with the numbers of other passengers who experienced a similar fate on that day. I arrived at Schiphol at 2 pm. The following hours included: me waiting in line - me being booked on a Lufthansa flight - being sent back from Lufthansa boarding because my name didn't get forwarded to Lufthansa - waiting in line again - being put on the waiting list for the KLM flight to Berlin later that evening - being sent back from boarding again because I didn't make it off the waiting list into the plane. Gotta mention that the customer service at Schiphol was very helpful the whole time, going through all possible options with me (I was disappointed that a rental car wasn't one, though!). You should have seen the look on the lady's face when I came back after the second failed connection around 9 pm. After 7 hours of from-A-to-B at Schiphol I resigned and agreed to a train connection the next morning and a hotel stay. These worked out. Unfortunately, my backpack got stuck in the loop at Schiphol and couldn't be given to me while I was there. It had to be claimed as ""missing"" and mailed to my address afterwards. Turns out the claim became real. My backpack really went missing and I had to wait 3 more weeks for it until receiving basically my whole wardrobe and souvenirs. Now that I am writing this, the compensation for products I had to buy as replacements for my delayed baggage has finally been paid (without problems) and I feel like my soul is finally at peace with this adventurous episode of being a KLM customer. When time has done its job mending the wounds, I will not hesitate to give KLM a second try. Looking forward to this future experience, a part of me hopes for another story to tell. Most of me however just hopes for a journey without the complications of this one.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin Tegel to Osaka via Amsterdam,September 2017,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,,3,yes,False,Berlin Tegel,Osaka,Amsterdam

I deliberately booked this flight as a last salute to one of my favourite aircraft in which I logged almost 150 flights in the last 10 years. The outbound flight from Amsterdam to Billund was with a KLM mainline Boeing 737, nothing special, on time departure and arrival with the standard onboard service of a coffee and a snack. The return flight, in this case the very last Fokker 70 flight from Billund to Amsterdam ever started as a complete let-down at the gate, business as usual, just a bunch of absolutely unfriendly gate agents. However when boarding the aircraft everything changed totally. The aircraft cabin was decorated with little flags and once all passengers boarded, the captain entered the cabin and welcomed all passengers and explained why this flight was a special event. It was also the entire crew's last flight on the Fokker 70. Upon departure to the main runway we received a water salute from the Billund fire brigade, followed by a very powerful take-off and a low-level bye bye pass over the airport. Onboard service during the flight was standard but the cabin crew did everything to make the flight memorable, well done! Landing in Amsterdam was on the rarely used Eastern runway which is the runway used in the past by the Fokker company to test fly and deliver their aircraft to their customers. Upon disembarking all passengers were personally greeted by the captain and both cabin crew.

My new husband lost his passport 2 days before our wedding, 5 days before flying to Madagascar. After a  passport office appointment they said it would likely be done by Mon/Tues when we were meant to be flying Monday. On Monday we were home waiting for the post hoping the passport would arrive before our evening flight that we booked with lastminute.com (spoiler alert, it didn't.) First thing we rang lastminute.com  to ask the costs for changing flights and get advice on the best options if it didn't arrive, after being on hold for a whole 60 minutes they said not their problem they wont help and we need to ring KLM . So we rang KLM and the first person said they didnt know how much but it wouldn't be a problem to change and they would email the details through, so we waited a while. Then rang KLM again who said not sure whats happening but they would email again, then they of course didnt. Then rang KLM again who said not their problem we should ring last minute.com Long story short we bounced between lastminute.com and KLM and not a single person we spoke to would help us or point us in the right direction. Now we treated ourselves with an expensive holiday for our once in a lifetime honeymoon but we are by no means able to just throw money away, and as noone would help after 6 solid hours of ringing people, we drove to manchester airport to see if anyone on a desk there would help. Turns out as i stand there making a fool out of myself sobbing my eyes out at the KLM desk they won't help us either and told us to ring the KLM number. So I had to make a decision, as we were unable to see if our flights could be changed to another day for a reasonable cost and in a panic of not being able to afford new flights for both of us I checked in myself and left him behind to sort this mess, in the end he just had to buy completely new flights, which also meant he couldn't fly back with me. I appreciate this whole mess was caused by a stupid mistake of my husbands, but seriously how hard is it to talk to someone about a change of flight . And even if it isn't something you can help with, how hard is it to not lie and say you will help but then don't, or even how hard is it to treat people with a little empathy and kindness. Every single person i have had to deal with from KLM, from the phone, helpdesk, check in desk and flight attendants were rude and looked like the last thing they wanted to do was do their job properly.

They might be mostly above the 45 age range but they were all very active throughout the 4 legs I had with KLM, even the 12 hrs flights and they handled the situation of the delay due to the technical error with a lot of experience and patience and never showed any attitude to any passenger even the Humble Andean old ladies sitting next to me.

As customers we have to except that cancellations do happen & that more often than not the decision to cancel is taken with our safety in mind. Every airline can run well under normal circumstances but a good test of a airline is to see how they cope with situations like these. KLM were aware of bad weather & by the time my flight had arrived had already cancelled a lot of flights, with this in mind you would of thought that a large business would ensure that they have enough staff on hand not only in the airport but also online & on the end of the phone to cope with the very predictable customer demand that would inevitably ensue. Not the case with KLM. Arrived in Amsterdam to a flight board of mostly delayed or cancelled flights, then had to virtually beg to get into the Crown Lounge with a Petroleum card despite being fully entitled to enter, I was later told that KLM staff were trying to reduce the amount of people in the lounge due to the cancellations. What is the point of issuing loyal customers with a privilege card if you are not prepared to give them the privilege in the first place? Upon being emailed & texted that my flight was cancelled I was given a link to click to re-arrange my flight, brilliant I thought, not brilliant as the link took me to a blank page. Not a problem I will go to the customer service desk & sort this. I (together with a lot of other people) had to wait for over 1hr and 30mins just to be seen, by which time all other seats were taken & waiting lists were at least ten deep for that days remaining flights. Not a problem, as I (& many others) hold a privilege card this takes my to the front of the ""waiting list"" for last minute seats, this is one of the major selling point of the privilege card system. But apparently when you most need this service KLM are not ready to honour it, leaving you as a loyal customer with no extra benefits that KLM had previously promised you in order to get your business & loyalty in the first place. 3 hours later I managed to re-book my flight, 5 hours later I managed to get to the hotel, to be far after this everything seems to be running ok. However, when you compare this airline to how other airlines cope with disruption KLM falls well short of just achieving basic organisation let alone good customer service. When you have your flight cancelled with KLM you will receive a voucher for 15 euros off inflight duty free which was not valid on my flight as my flight is under 70 minutes in duration. Or 2000 air miles credited to your account but only after you learn to read Dutch to decipher the voucher you have been given & then post in all your boarding passes & receipts to a international address, which will probably cost you the same in postage as the miles are worth. This is after you have tried to re-book your flight using one of the three online services they advertise, non of them worked & no response was received from any for over 12 hours. So in all likely hood you will have a 1 hour 30 minute wait to see a (understandably) fed up customer service rep.

Outward flight in Boeing 737 was delayed for 25 mins because of early-morning fog at Schipol, and arrived similarly late. Aircraft clean and comfortable, although would prefer non-reclining seats for these short-haul flights to prevent interaction with inconsiderate passengers in front. Good connection at Schipol onto Embreaer 190 - what a nice little aircraft this is! But take-off again delayed owing to air traffic control, and landed 30 mins late. Return journey had 737 for both legs. Delayed again leaving Venice, but flight to Newcastle on schedule. Aircraft staff very pleasant and efficient, although would prefer some imposition of rules on cabin bags as too many oversize bags on board, greatly reducing the available locker space for those of us who observe the rules.

It should have arrived today, but now they say it will probably be tomorrow.

We paid some C$3000 each and expected normal business class accommodation. No warning of this sub-standard accommodation was given when booking through Expedia. Detailed research failed to reveal it. The senior purser agreed that it was well below standard. So did the station-manager in Edmonton. KLM customer support ignored their views. It dismissed our subsequent complaint on the basis that information about the seats ""is explicitly presented on our website"". In fact it is far from explicit. Firstly, you do not expect to pay a full business class fare and get nothing more than oversize economy seating. Secondly even if you spend time trying to check it is virtually impossible to work out which aircraft you will be on. In addition the promise that you will have a privacy canopy is surprising. There was none visible nor any sign that there ever had been. We feel thoroughly cheated. The casual dismissal of our complaint has made it worse.

On contacting the baggage handlers at the airport, they again assured me the item would be on that night's flight and forwarded to me etc. Again it did not happen and this was repeated for the duration of my stay in Israel, from the 9th until 14th of Sept. It is now the 25th of September and despite being assured by KLM that my missing baggage would now be forwarded to my home address, it has not happened.

We arrived at the airport in Barcelona and Transavia was not able to print our boarding cards for the second flight (Amsterdam - Lima). Due to bad weather, we had to sit for 90 minutes in the aircraft, waiting to take off. Due to the delay, we had 15 minutes to make it to the second flight in Amsterdam but since we had no boarding cards, we had to rush in to the transfer desk. At that point the Schiphol airport was already a completely chaos. Queues everywhere. Not info at all where should you start queueing and so on.

We didn't want to do another connection but KLM said that they would only cover the hotel for one night (August in Amsterdam, not a lot of budget options to stay overnight). Our agent in Schiphol was extremely rude. I can understand that she had an awful day, but waiting in line for 8 hours is neither fun. We ended up accepting the flight via Bogotá and headed to a hotel we booked (KLM hotels were all booked out but KLM explained that they will cover the hotel expenses afterwards). The following day we took the flight and landed in Lima without luggage. Nobody knew where it was.

The flight has been canceled. Further information follows. Still confident that it would be good. A few hours ago, the news came that the flight we were in was now the next day. And then with a stopover. We would arrive at our destination more than 24 hours later. I could not afford this delay, considering work-related matters. Then you call. Wait for 40 minutes and you will not be helped. Eventually via Facebook Messenger had contact. But beyond that this was the best possible option and a referral to the complaint form, we did not arrive. Additional hotel accommodation was not offered. So I had to book myself. We are not informed about any refund or compensation. I have because I could not afford this delay to book a ticket with another company of € 400!  While waiting at the airport, KLM had several flights to Amsterdam. Apparently, with a flight that goes beyond 24 hours later than planned, you can arrange everything yourself, at least when you fly with KLM.  An annoying end of a vacation.

While Premium Economy (which is offered by other airlines) is usually a different service class with more generous seats and slightly better service, Economy Comfort seats are standard economy seats with more legroom and 50% more recline (on long haul flights). The service is exactly the same as in Economy. However, Economy Comfort seats are usually much more affordable than Premium Economy seats.

Now to the bad thing. KLM will let you choose a seat but if you want an emergency exit seat you have to pay extra. On almost all other airlines you an choose an emergency row seat when you are lucky enough to be one of the first to check in. But on KLM, no way. If you do not want to pay extra then you are stuck in the seats with less than 30 inch seat pitch. Now I am 196 cm tall where most of my height is in the legs, so a 30 inch seat pitch is just far too little. KLM won't even let you move after the freight has started unless you pay. On most other airlines I have never complained about this because I had a chance to choose an emergency row seat, but I am a really strong believer in the fact that I should not pay more to have the same kind of comfort as a person only being 170 cm.

For the most part these were good quality KLM transatlantic flights, with on-time departure/arrival, comfortable seating (Economy Comfort leg-room is well worth the extra outlay when you're flying long-haul) and a friendly cabin crew. The only sour note was the food, featuring rather fatty chicken which disagreed with me considerably. I'll just put it down to an off week in their catering department (people do have cold periods from time to time) and fly them again sometime, since on a number of past flights I have found KLM's service (including the food) to be of a very high standard.

Crews were polite and attentive. Eco comfort seating was lovely. Their European catering is strange, but since there is a full bar service, not much to be unhappy about. Transfer at Amsterdam requires lots of walking, but terminal is perfectly organized, signage is easy and smart, security search was efficient (but not overly fast), so I have easily made a connection of 55 minutes.

Catering was of very good quality. My Japanese option was delivered first and didn't disappoint me. Lots of drink rounds. Great plane. Sorry to see 747s being grounded and replaced.

It was a while ago flying a long haul flight with KLM and I was a bit concerned after many good flights with Singapore Airlines in recent years. But I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, service was much better than my last KLM long haul flight to Dar es Salaam. The crew were friendly and pretty attentive. Secondly, the food was tasty. It started with dinner (evening flight), finished with cheese quiche and ice cream in between. No problem to get more food if you left hungry and ask for. Enough drinks including wine, beer etc. Last but not least, the aircraft and IFE. For an 8 hour flight the seat width and pitch are reasonable. The electronic dimmable shades do work, mood lighting is nice and cabin noise is relatively low. In my opinion the biggest advantage of the 787 is the increased humidity compared to older aircraft. Nice IFE touch screen. However, if you look at the details my previous A350 flights with Singapore Airlines scored better on almost every aspect. KLM 787-9 is lacking a separate IFE control unit (for people who like gaming) and the screen is not adjustable, there could be more lavatories and it would be better if it had manual shades. Also the A350 cabin is a little bit wider. It would be nice if KLM replace their plastic cutlery for metal and replace the paper hot towels for cotton. The efficiency of meal service could be better as well (it was not very organised). Overall I was satisfied.

In an economy or comfort seat, one has under the seat in front of you, or the back of the seat in front, to put things. In business class, there was only one small shelf available and couldn't use it during takeoff and landings. There was no wifi on the flight but the movie, etc. selections were fine.

A long trip by any standard, made further complicated by KLM routing me via CDG when there is a direct flight from AMS to EDI! Firstly, check in at Lima was a mess, taking an hour in a badly organised queue with people getting angry. Then departure was 40 mins late with no explanation given. Also, despite checking in as soon as check in was open, KLM did not let me choose a seat ('unavailable' for some reason) and placed me in a middle seat, between 2 strangers! For a 12 hour flight. The seats were very hard on the Boeing 777, and the food was quite bad, at the level of hospital food or worse. IFE showed the same films I'd seen on the way there (with AF, a better experience). Then, arriving in AMS and tired after a long trip, I asked if I could not be put on the direct flight to EDI so as to save time and hassle; I was given robotic answers that this was 'impossible' with no explanation. After that, I find out that the Amsterdam to Paris flight is 30 minutes, then 1 hr late, making me fear I'd lose my connection! I barely made it, having to run in Paris CDG. Of course, luggage did not make it. I am very disappointed as I am an AF-KLM customer for 15 years with close to 100k miles and no consideration was given to this; the airline labels itself as the 'most punctual in the world' in its literature, which makes me laugh based on my experience.

This was a nice break for such a long flight and the fact that we did not have to change aircraft was also very nice. I paid extra for an economy comfort seat and for a gourmet meal. The meal was amazing and worth the extra $20.00. The economy comfort seat had decent legroom however I did not find it that comfortable, I also understand that on a 16 hour flight at some point your seat will become uncomfortable. KLM flight attendants did a great job at ensuring that there were some space in between the rows. For example I was seated in a three seat configuration and they made sure that the middle seat was empty. I learned a good lesson however which is never to book a window seat on such a long flight that way you avoid disturbing the person in the aisle seat specially if you are the restless type that needs to walk around the aircraft. I normally do not get up from my seat much but somehow I found myself quite restless and uncomfortable at times on the seat. I do have to say that I was very disappointed at the fact that on this flight and on this excellent aircraft Wi-Fi was not offered however the entertainment choices on the interactive screen were decent.  3 hot meals were served and every two hours they passed by with the trolley and offered snacks and beverages.

Boeing 777-200 with new slimline seats. Having now experienced at first hand this seat I can only agree with the many reviewers that the closeness to the passenger sitting next to you is just too invasive. What I did like was its firmness and especially for taller passengers the vertically extendable headsets for good support but it desperately needs to be a few centimeters wider to win over my seal of approval. Even the so-called Economy Comfort seats (not to be confused with Premium Economy on other airlines) are only a fraction better as the added comfort might be in length and recline but not in width. Immensely appreciated the mixture of young and older stewardesses and top marks for the way they interacted with all passengers during the flight. On my two trips the pursers were situated in my section, whose professionalism I greatly enjoyed.  And one of the stewardesses was working on her last flight before getting married. This was with great fanfare announced by the captain followed by a guest appearance of one the off-duty pilots to congratulate her in person and making himself available to answer questions from passengers. Usage of the inflight entertainment system was easy and had a good selection of new, recent and foreign movies that I was able to catch up on. A few notes on the preparation of the trip, it was disappointing not being able to bid for an upgrade to business class as stated on the KLM website for the legs.

However, that was 3 days ago and I have called the airline 6 times to be told 6 different stories and different times to expect my luggage. They confirmed that my luggage was found and arrived in the UK (1 hour from when I am staying) on Thursday evening and said it had been picked up by the courier they hire on Friday morning. Currently the earliest expected delivery time they can give me is Monday evening. This is 5 and a half days after arriving in the country (and that is providing this information is not false like the previous 5 expected arrival times).

Most times I end up on Lufthansa, British Airways or SAS, who all have wider seats, bigger screens and power supply in their premium economy class (I avoid the US airlines for all it's worth). The additional leg space and seat width makes the difference for me. For the first time I chose to try KLM premium economy for my Houston to Amsterdam trip. What a disappointment! The seats were the same as in economy class, i.e. exactly the same width. The only difference was a few inches extra of leg space. If you choose an emergency seat, which costs less than the premium economy on KLM, you basically get a better product. The screens looked like they came from a different era, pixelated and tiring to look at. Also, there was no power supply at all.

I had read a lot of negative remarks that we chose KLM rather resentfully, but the itinerary from FRA was more convenient than Air Berlin. For Curaçao, there was no other reasonable choice. This little competition makes the tickets rather pricy in comparison to flights to Asia. Their website is awful in many respects (I would have to fill pages, so I don't write why), that made our expectations not very happy either. We were very surprised that none of our prejudices turned out to be confirmed. Not a single delay, on the contrary - we reached all destinations up to 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Friendly staff on ground and in the air. On both long hauls, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful - we are accustomed to Asian Airlines and have become quite fastidious about service, but this reached the same level. Our prebookings of gluten free and Hindu meals had been lost by their sappy website, but the staff did their utmost to compose some convenient replacement food for us and re-ordered instantly our meals for the return flight (with success). The quality of the food itself was average but edible. The movie entertainment consisted mainly of stale news, mainstream thrillery, or animations which I preferred because the screens are not good enough for any dark scene in a normal movie - you see nothing but a black screen. Because of the cheap earbuds, acoustics qualities are very low and it was hard to understand much of the dialogues in English (English subtitles would help a lot!) - and there were few films in German.

The SkyTeam Lounge at Heathrow is adequate, enough space to sit and have a quiet drink and a snack. There is WiFi. Catering OK, but my usual carrier is Etihad, so the experience was a little different, no a la carte table service. Flight boarded at T4 from the gate opposite the Lounge, very convenient. At Schipol we had just about 50 minutes from touchdown to the onward connection, which was enough time to have a quick drink, find our way to the gate and immediately board the next flight. With such a short connection I was worried our luggage wouldn't make the flight, but when we arrived at KUL there it was! The new World Business Class is very open and comfortable. The seating is great, save for the fact that you have no direct aisle access for the window seat. If you are travelling as a couple this is fine, for solo travellers it might prove tiresome. The on-board service was great, the staff were attentive and extremely helpful. The catering was OK, very Dutch shall we say! The drinks were good quality, but a bit mean. Nothing that one could really grumble about. The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new and classic programming to keep me entertained until bed time! The bed is great and I slept like a baby. Even though they are older aircraft I like the sense of space you get with the Boeing 777, which somehow you don't quite feel on other aircraft even the 380. The price was comparable to Etihad (about GBP 300 more) but the flight is 1hr to AMS, a 1hr layover and then a 12hr leg to KUL. Reverse journey the same timings. For EY you have a 3 or 4 hour layover and now they have adjusted their timetable you have to either leave UK early in the morning or arrive very late to KUL. The KLM timings are much friendlier.

The flights were the typical KLM Cityhopper regional service, both left reasonably in time but arrived spot on time at destination. On both flights, the onboard service consisted of a pre-packed muffin and a pre-packed cup of water. To my surprise no coffee or tea was offered, probably due to the 40min. flying time.

A great crew, attentive and the friendliest of other airlines I've flown. The only negative point remains that KLM charges a hefty price, as flyers on this route are captive (and mostly business travel).  I would understand this if the Business Class cabin had already been renewed; but as the A330 fleet is the last to be upgraded and I would have found fair that, until these have been modernised, Business Class fares would reflect as the actual comfort level which is nowhere like the updated AF/KLM quality.

The 'Indische rijsttafel' was without a doubt the best food I have had on a plane. We avoided flying KLM for several years as they were far behind vis à vis other airlines on their business class product but we did not have much of a choice on the Curacao travel, and I have to state that I was pleasantly surprised to experience that they have catched up.

At the rescheduled time of departure, one would expect that the issue would be resolved. This was not the case. The pilot was able to explain to us that one of the engines was having mechanical issues and an engineer would assess the situation. After an additional hour or so of delay it was decided that the plane was not in suitable condition to fly. I'm grateful for the discretion here. The passengers were asked to leave the plane and given no direction afterward. They offered hotel accommodation for out of town visitors as reparation. After exiting the secure area of the terminal the crowd of passengers could not find anyone to help us. I personally heard four contradictory statements on who to contact to reschedule the flight. After calling the number provided to me by an unruly ground worker for KLM, I was put on hold for a Delta helpline and the call was lost.

Because of the problems with engine, we had to land in Chicago. After this unexpected rupture of the flight, my friends and I had to wait for more than two hours to receive hotel vouchers. KLM personnel told us to wait outside of the airport for a free shuttle to get to the hotel, but the shuttle never arrived (we were waiting for more than one hour). We were calling and calling the hotel, but it never responded. After we took a taxi and reached, finally, the hotel, it turned out there were no vacant rooms for us there. The hotel's personnel sent us to another location (another taxi on our expense), and we were lucky to find vacant rooms there - it was about 3 am. Overall, it took us about five hours to have finally a rest after we landed. The next day, I found out that the route of my flight was changed - now, I had to take a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt and an Aeroflot flight to Moscow, Lufthansa assigned me a seat to fly to Frankfurt, but they could not issue a boarding pass from FRA to SVO saying that they are not partners with Aeroflot. So, until I arrived to Frankfurt, I did not know whether Aeroflot would take me or not, Thanks God, it did.

However, this afternoon I tried to check in online for my return flight, only to be told I was 'on standby'. Incidentally, KLM had not bothered to inform me of this themselves, despite having my contact details. I hold a confirmed ticket purchased last August. Angry protests via their Facebook page and over the phone have elicited nothing beyond 'come to the airport to find out your options'. That will take at least two hours and may be pointless, but since they will not confirm whether or not I will be able to take the flight before tomorrow evening, I have no choice. Also, because it leaves at 19,00, so if they do bump me, as they apparently intend to do, all other alternative flights will have left, and there will be no chance of getting away before 19th - at the earliest.

Our cab had to wait for an hour and twenty minutes while we made a lost baggage claim. Again. No help from the ground staff. No KLM staff available in lost baggage office. Got nasty Delta lady who told us it's a KLM problem. We at least got a reference number. So I just called KLM to ask when I could expect my bag. I was asked to ham up and call back as this representative's computer was down. I called back and was eventually told I could expect my back within 8 hours.

The plane was very old, the entertainment system didn’t work, had to be reset for the entire plan, and still went out halfway through the flight. Clearly the crew were aware that it was a recurring problem. If you know your entertainment system is not working, you should disclose it in advance. Also, 8,000 points is not adequate compensation for it not working. If you listed a seat for sale and disclosed the fact that the entertainment system didn't work, you would have to offer more than an 8,000 point discount for someone to purchase it vs. a working seat. The plane in general was old, seats did not recline and return properly. The complete disregard for these obvious issues made me wonder what other, less visible, ways the maintenance of the plane was neglected.

The Facebook support also helped us arrange the seats we wanted to, very good way to communicate with customer! The flight itself was just OK. Their B777-300ER in the original configuration (no new economy class) feels very cramped and a little outdated, the seats are not very comfortable, IFE has a great selection of movies, but is very slow and only controllable via remote (which sometimes did not work properly).

Hopefully this was a one-off less pleasant experience. We left with KLM from Brussels to Amsterdam Schiphol to switch to another KLM flight to Bangkok. At our first flight was already wrong: technical problem with the brakes, impossible to leave. After an hour delay we left, and we find out onboard the plane that just connections after 18h (we left at 17:45) were possible. We finally came to Amsterdam to 17h15, where we walked fast with the whole family (traveling with two children) to be told at the gate that we were rebooked via Kuala Lumpur. First of all, we have never asked this but eventually I assume KLM does this only with good intentions. Yet when we were at the gate with children and luggage, the plane was still there, and more people were still boarding and we were not allowed on the plane! KLM decided us to book via Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok, adding a lot of time to our booked journey. The reaction of the staff on the spot was not friendly at all. Eventually, we have to abide by their decision, we were not allowed on the flight, so we went back to the KLM information counter. There they confirmed we had an extra few hours waiting to catch the flight to Kuala Lumpur. When you take such a long journey with children and you book in advance your seats on the plane, we then discovered that we could not sit together as a group of 4, but the staff was able to keep us places 2-2 adjacant in the middle row with 4 seats and 2 seats next to us free so that we would have more space . How do you explain to me that we cannot sit side by side with 4 seats, but with two and two empty seats?Leaving Kuala Lumpur again a technical fault with our plane to Bangkok, again more than 30min delay.

The general feel of the airplane was that it needs to be updated. The food was ok, the seat and leg room were ok (although the reclining seat was clunky and didn't work very well), the staff was great, but the entertainment part was definitely behind, and there were no plugs for smart phones or computers. First, they didn't provide ear buds. I came prepared and had my own. Even if you have your own, you need to ask for an adapter, precisely because of the age of their entertainment system. Their entertainment system is old (think probably from the early 90s). The colors on the screen were awful and you could barely see anything. I skipped all the major blockbusters in the selection, because watching them in such poor conditions would be ridiculous. The choice of movies was ok, but quite average compared to other modern airlines. On top of all that, my unit was not working properly for the whole beginning of the trip, and because of that, the call button for the staff was also not working. Eventually, I was able to grab someone from the staff and they had to reset the unit. All this to say that, although I would still be ok recommending the airline, it would be with some serious reserves.

1190,A Anderson,United States,2016-08-10,2,"✅ Verified Review   This was our first time traveling with KLM and it was a huge disappointment. I traveled with a second person and we bought our tickets a month before the date. We started at Baltimore and got assigned seats for our Baltimore to New JFK flight as well as the flight from New York JFK to Amsterdam. When we landed in Amsterdam for our travel to Stockholm we were told that we weren't guaranteed a ticket and that we had to fly standby. This made no sense because we had bought our tickets a month ago and because we checked in to all our flights more than 24 hours before the flight to Stockholm. After much drama and waiting, we ended up getting seats but not sitting together. After more than 24 hours of travel and hundreds of dollars spent on these tickets it was a huge disappointment to not be able to sit next to my partner. We definitely were not the last ones to buy the tickets or to check in at the airport. The staff didn't have a good explanation and while they were friendly and courteous I am not inclined to fly with this airline again due to their incompetent way of assigning seats. This was too stressful and there are dozens of other airlines to choose from. In summary I felt cheated - I did not get what I paid for when traveling with KLM.

1214,B Robertson,Switzerland,2016-07-04,9,"✅ Verified Review  With the renewal of its cabins and now of its fleet, KLM definitely is in the lift. I had the pleasure of flying its brand new 787 from Osaka to Amsterdam and what a pleasure it was. The cabin lay-out is similar to what is found in other upmarket companies like EVA Air, with all the latest gadgets, including wifi on board. Checking in Osaka was standard, straightforward and fast, but the line for security was long. The lounge was nice and well-catered, but a bit cramped. Boarding was smooth and well-organised. The inflight service was excellent - good catering (both Japanese-based on the recipes of the famous Yamasato restaurant at the Okura in Amsterdam and western), and portions were copious. The atmosphere in the 787 cabin is very pleasant. However, staff hinted that there was little space for them in the pantries and that this hindered them in providing the desired service levels - not noted by me, at least. The flight departed on time and arrived 30 minutes early. With the upgraded cabin lay-out in its old 747s and its 777s, KLM is now scoring high among its European competitors. Transit at Schiphol airport was smooth. And at the end of the flight I was lucky that Delft bleu house 96 was on board, so I have my collection complete again.

1223,M Ratrime,Switzerland,2016-06-19,3,"✅ Verified Review   Guayaquil to Lyon via Amsterdam. It has been the first time I flew Business class on KLM and my experience was somehow disappointing mainly because of the seat confort and the disappointing onboard gastronomical experience. Very surspisingly KLM didn't offer on this 11 hour flight a full flat seat which should be a standard today for a 4 star airline. The seat did not completely recline in horizontal position, which made sleeping very difficult and unconfortable. As I complained to the cabin crew, they told me that on various KLM planes there are still the old business class seats (as the one I was in). So, be aware when booking KLM business class because you could experience a very unconfortable night flight without much sleep as I had. I also found the catering experience disappointing. The food quality of the main course was not good, meat was dry and hard. It looked like an economy class meal, just heated up and presented in nice porcelane. I don't like neither the way food was served in business class as flight attendant serve it from the usual economy class trolleys and they still serve you a plastic (I guess it was hard plastic) tray on your table. I found it a real lack of class, KLM should really improve the way they serve this dishes to its guests in the business class. The quality of the coffee served on board was undrinkeable. IFE should be updated to todays standard. Its not user friendly, it looks old and the choice could be better. The staff is very friendly, helpful and caring about its guests, they really like to interact with the passenger. The quality and personnality of KLM flight attendants is probaly what makes KLM so unique. On the short leg from Amsterdam to Guayaquil everything was perfect. A good and tasteful light meal was served and again the staff was very nice and caring. VIP Lounge in Guayaquil is of really poor quality. It looks old, somehow dirty, food choice is not that much great as there is a lot of junk food and you have to pay for alcoholic drinks. However KLM offers a welcome beer or a glass of wine to its passenger which is very appreciated. To summarize I would say that KLM has a very good product for shorthaul and transatlantic economy class whic defeats many of its competitors. However KLM should really speed up in updating its Business Class experience because they do not have a competitive product today.

Luggage drop off via the Skypriority entrance was fast and efficient and the lines for security check were shorter than the other lines. Breakfast choices in the KLM Crown lounge are 365 days/year the same, but OK. Boarding smooth, Skypriority was enforced. When boarding was completed the aircraft remained at the gate for 10 more minutes allowing them to load the last transfer luggage, making sure that all passengers arrived in Bergen with their luggage.

The food selection has deteriorated. Far too much attention to Chinese options because of the Asia focus. As an example the return journey had beef on three places within the menu. No specific choice for vegetarians The Chinese meals were formulated in small narrow dishes which left you feeling empty. There has definitely been a cutback in the quantity of food provided.

Marginally improved personal space than the old style. Onboard service pretty poor, food and drink limited. Hot towels were cold, Hot rolls were cold, even the coffee was cold. Many items missing from meal tray. Food trolley prepared far too much in advance of service. Given that the service outbound was fantastic, this inbound leg to AMS has very disappointing.

1255,C Rogers,Hong Kong,2016-04-09,9,"✅ Verified Review   It was such a joy to realize that Bali to Singapore has a KLM route and that business class is so affordable. Captain walked through the business class cabin, looked a little tired and dour, but thought nothing of it. The replacement crew for the Singapore to Amsterdam leg was seated in business class with us, creating a sense of calm and well-resourced and relaxed crew. Seats are the new World Business Class with full flat bed. I didn't use that feature, but definitely clicked it down to about 60 degrees to rest after my third glass of wine. The cabin amenities are great. Good food. Wine selection is incredible. I chose an Argentinian red that really kept its spice at 35,000 feet. Weather looked like we should expect quite a few bumps, but we emerged from 10,000 climbing out of Bali and captain immediately took off the seat belt sign and we cruised along quite smoothly and silky for most of the two hours of level flight. There was one moment of lightning and big hammer tops, but captain and first officer artfully wiggled around them picked up speed and got us into Singapore 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Cockpit messages were brief and not very informative, but that's okay. Professional and cool and was happy that they were clear and gave all the details about arrival and weather. For the most part this is just a lovely luxury shuttle from Bali to Singapore.  I felt relaxed, calm and really satisfied with the service. I've used it three times since I learned about this route. Something about being in those big blue planes makes you feel respected and appreciated. Cabin crew was great and ratio of passenger to flight attendant was good.

We experienced very good customer service from the KLM social media team who resolved an issue with a inexplicable change to our inbound flight very quickly, and they were extremely responsive and helpful. The outbound flight was very good - we found there was more leg room than on a lot of flights. The entertainment was excellent with latest movie releases and good TV system. The staff were efficient and food was fine. With our inbound flight, we received an email 24 hours before the scheduled flight time stating that our flight from KL to Amsterdam was delayed by 4 hours - meaning departing at 0320 and missing our connecting flight from Amsterdam to Leeds - not good. The email stated nothing about what KLM were going to do about this, so we immediately phoned the customer service team. The lady we spoke to very quickly made alternative arrangements for us - by booking us on a completely different flight with Malaysia Airlines to London and then BA from London to Leeds - this solution meant departing at the same time as the original booked flight, and getting back to Leeds slightly earlier than with the original booking - so we were delighted with this solution and the way it was arranged so promptly, with email confirmation coming through straight away. Our only gripe is that fact that the original email was lacking in information and we had to call the customer services team rather than them proactively communicating the alternative option to us.

The check-in guy took my boarding pass and, after a few minutes gave it back to me saying the problem had been solved and that I could board. I had the same seat on the first flight, but did not look at the second. Big mistake. They had put me on standby despite me having checked in earlier. When I got to Amsterdam I was told the flight had been heavily oversold and there was nothing they could do. I went to the gate to find total chaos. Loads of people were without seats and they were asking for volunteers to miss the flight. In the end, after much argument I got an Economy seat. I have sent two emails to KLM customer service but with no reply. I got sent a completely incomprehensible automatically generated email which nobody I show it to can explain.

We had asked for Muslim meals, apparently KLM have just one Muslim meal to offer all passengers because it was exactly the same meal we got a month ago flying to the United States - apparently KLM are cutting a lot of corners trying to reduce costs. The final straw was arriving in Dubai my connection to Doha on FlyDubai was cancelled for my 11 month old son and if it wasn't for the kindness of DNATA officials who convinced FlyDubai to take my son on an infant booking rather than a child fare which I had paid KLM for!

About a week before the start of the journey I found myself having to use crutches for a knee complaint. I was quite concerned about how I would cope with everything from seat space to just getting around the airport etc, but KLM staff/cabin crew were excellent and I felt well cared for. The seat space was enough for me to feel comfortable. I was disappointed that although only in row 17, the choice of food ran out by the time it reached me leaving only a veg spicy dish which I cannot eat. Luckily there were bread rolls etc. A minor complaint but worth mentioning. Our flight from Calgary was about an hour late getting in, meaning that we missed our connection and had about 7 hrs to wait in Schipol.

The only downsides were: Older Airbus A330 including the in-flight entertainment system (mediocre movie selection) with a confusing remote control that is placed in the armrest and would pause/stop a movie if you accidentally bumped into it. The entertainment system requires a big metal box under every 2 seats that took up a 1/3 of available foot space making it impossible to stretch both which was rather uncomfortable on the 9+ hour flight.

To find some sleep in this narrow situation is difficult. The legroom in the extra legroom economy is fine and the recline of the seat helps. In my opinion this is worth the money. The new entertainment system in the 777-200 was fine and they had a nice collection of films and shows. The flight attendants were friendly and nice. Boarding in Cape Town as complicated and inefficient. There is so much space in the hall but they have to do it right in the smallest corner.

Drinks served including beer and wine, with additional drinks on request. A cheese sandwich with no alternatives served on the inbound flights to AMS and biscuits/crisps on outbound legs. Forget the food, but the drink service was okay. Not a bad inflight product for European standards. However, room for improvement operational wise (delays and lost luggage).

1293,Timothy Wills,United Kingdom,2015-12-17,6,"I have just flown my outward leg of a short break to Hong Kong and have mixed feelings about the journey. I should have left Manchester at 7.50am but the flight was apparently oversold so got bumped to a later flight which was actually listed as the 5.50am earlier flight that was delayed due to a technical problem. Given how empty this later actually flight was, I think it was more the case of me being bumped because I had no status with the airline and KLM simply moved all their Gold and Silver members to my flight. I was supposed to be connecting to a Xiamen Airlines flight (AMS-XMN then XMN-HKG) in AMS but after pointing out that I might make the connection but my baggage definitely wouldn't, the check-in staff agreed and rerouted me. The only way I could get to Hong Kong was to be rebooked onto KLM's direct flight leaving AMS at 5.45pm so had nearly 6 hours layover in Schipol airport. However I was offered 120 euros as compensation so wasn't too depressed and it meant not having to go through the nonsense of immigration at Xiamen despite being a transit passenger. The first leg of the journey (MAN-AMS) left after 9.30am and was not helped by whoever's decision it was to refuel it the plane only once all the passengers were on-board the aircraft. I ask you, this aircraft had been sat empty for at least previous 3 hours! The flight itself was comfortable with decent seat width/pitch plus crew came around with a snack and a drink. Once at AMS, I found the KLM desk and managed to bag an exit row for the 11 hour flight and was delighted until I discovered that the plane (B747-400) had no in-seat USB power in economy unlike the new Xiamen Airlines B787 Dreamliner (which is partly why I booked with Xiamen Airlines in the first place). Boarding was smooth but I was surprised how tight in width the seats were. However once into the flight, I could really understand why many airlines are now ditching the 747 in favour of more modern planes like the the 787 or the A380.  However this KLM flight did have one redeeming feature that was the staff who worked hard the entire flight. The toilets which I was sat close to were cleaned around 4-5 times and crew offered drinks throughout the flight. The food offerings were beef or pasta but by the time they reached me, the pasta had run out and I thought I might be missing out but was brought along a vegetarian Indian style meal which was rather good. As we were descending into Hong Kong, I discovered my seat was broken and could not return to the upright position. One of the crew came around and fixed it but a few minutes later, I could feel it had gone again when I leant back. Given we were so close to landing, I just leant forward instead and kept quiet. The best thing about the whole flight is that I only paid £340 including credit card charge booking fees so happy that I am now in Hong Kong and enjoying my break.",Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MAN to HKG via AMS,December 2015,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,4,yes,False,MAN,HKG,AMS

There was also way too little food on the way back, and no advertising of the measly sandwiches available in the galleys (only one choice though, slightly musty Dutch cheese and butter, healthy!). The stewardess seemed reluctant to give them away, does she take them home at the end of service?

This is not a case of his arms resting on the shared arm rest but a case of the arms coming past the armrest into my seat area.

1307,Henk Ham,Netherlands,2015-11-18,5,"Living in the Netherlands, KLM is my airline of choice. I am also a member of the their flying blue program, trying to get my status to a point that makes sense. This review applies to all my flights with KLM this year. The last flight was not to bad. KLM planes are generally old and uncomfortable but on short flights that is not a problem. On longer flights (I flew to South Africa 4 times this year), I would not recommend them. The staff in almost all cases is friendly and will do all they can to make the flight bearable. But don't try to complain to KLM customer service, they are the worst in the industry and will ignore your request or simply insult you in their answer. I think KLM quality is going down over the years. They do their best to cope but I cannot help but fear that KLM will not survive in the long run as customer satisfaction is what makes us choose an airline over anything else.

The airline also offers a 10kg checked bag, two pieces of baby equipment and a carry on at no charge, even when you do not have a seat booked for them, in this day and age of restrictions this was huge for us. In general the crew was incredibly understanding and unfazed by our little one, often engaging with her and trying to make her laugh if she was getting fussy. It was a huge help and stress reliever to know we weren't treated as an annoyance to be tolerated. As far as general comments the seats were standard but definitely more comfortable than some flights we've been on.

1325,Linda Evans,United Kingdom,2015-10-17,4,"I agree entirely with the reviewer who was disgruntled with KLM business class between Moscow and Amsterdam. The outward business class flight (Amsterdam-Moscow) had been with Aeroflot, and I was initially disappointed to learn that it wasn't going to be KLM. I shouldn't have been! The Aeroflot experience was really good - we were greeted on arrival with a choice of sparkling white wine, orange juice or water, we were given a proper menu for lunch, and were served with a linen tablecloth and napkin. We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one. There were only two seats per row, which meant they were really wide (though there's nothing separating you from your neighbour). The return, with KLM, was very disappointing. As the other reviewer mentioned, the seats were the standard narrow ones and they'd simply left the middle seat empty. That didn't bother me too much because it was only a medium haul flight, but the level of service and the quality of food was far inferior to Aeroflot. There was a choice of two main hot dishes, but no printed menu, and they had even run out of choice for the gentleman sitting behind me. He complained - justifiably - and whilst the steward serving the meals didn't seem to grasp the significance of a business class passenger not having his choice, the senior attendant did, and she was very apologetic and gave the passenger a gift of two small bottles of champagne to take with him on landing. But the hot meal was served in what was so obviously a microwaveable-type dish, with the foil cover left on it. We had been given a choice of orange juice or water on boarding - but no sparkling wine - and not until all the passengers had boarded (to be fair, the size of the plane would've made it difficult to serve us drinks as the aisles were filled with a stream of boarding passengers, but the absence of sparkling wine was disappointing - and they didn't have the finesse to give us napkins). There was no facility to watch a film. Basically, it was a standard flight that they'd just tried to 'tart up' a bit. With the Aeroflot flight, in contrast, you felt like it was a proper business class flight - we had even got toiletry bags, blankets, and a gift of speciality tea to take with us on landing.

The service was lousy and one of the steewardess was very arrogant. Food was below average for plane food and dessert was inedible. Wine offering was also very poor.

Beer offered is their ""national"" Heineken. The seats are adjusted to let as many people sit in the aircraft, which means that people who have long legs or are wider than average can't sit comfortably. Their measure for leg room must be people of 1.70m (5.7f). Yes, you can pay for more legroom. Crew is professional and friendly, no complaints there. Ground crew smashed our luggage beyond repair, most airlines have deals with suitcase shops that a claim is dealt directly. But with KLM you have to send them photos, proof of purchase, a shop's confirmation that it's beyond repair, and ten other things to their HQ. The claim then takes months to be processed. On the positive side they give you extra refund to cover for exchange expenses, bank fees etc. To sum the experience I would say you get far better quality services by airlines like Ryanair and Wizz Air, considering the price.

Mediocre catering and wine offer, including an awful Brazilian red. Snacks on return very poor.

1376,Jayne Southwell,United Kingdom,2015-08-05,9,"Flew World Business Class on outward flight and return from Amsterdam. There was a two hour delay, due to weather so not KLM's fault and the other due to toilets not working correctly which were thankfully fixed before departure. We were kept informed of the former delay via e-mail and a telephone call and as the plane boarded with a personal apology which was a nice approach. Service outbound was fantastic. Excellent food and choice of wines particulary the Dutch white, also the ruby port. The new flatbed seats I found spacious and speedily adjustable. The flight back was OK but lacked the personal and efficient element of outbound which is why I didn't give full marks. Staff friendly but I gained the impression staff just wanted passengers fed and watered as quickly as possible and many things were forgotten, from cognac to museli, everything was a rush. To confirm what others have said, boarding chaotic at Schipol which was nothing to do with security, just the insistence of moving children with associated buggies, people with special requirements and business class all at the same time. BA stagger boarding in that order which is more sensible as one might have priority boarding but you have to climb over everyone else in the waiting area which is so small. Didn't happen on European hopper flights however we flew economy as didn't see the point of an upgrade on a 45 min flight. Efficient, organised service from boarding to arrival.

After that I had to go through security, it was the first time that I used the new central security filter at AMS which opened in June. It went really well. A nice and smooth process. AMS is being renewed, lounge 2 and the Holland boulevard were one big construction site. There were some improvised shops but it wasn’t the AMS standard, I was a bit disappointed that some facilities were not available, for example the Airport Library and the Aiprort’s mini Rijksmuseum. The boarding process took some time but it wasn’t too bad. When we boarded it was a bit chaotic, but the cabin crew were doing their best to get everyone seated as quickly as possible. We had a 2 hr 20 min delay due to a malfunction in a toilet and a late arrival of the aircraft due to delay in LAX. We took off smoothly from Amsterdam Schiphol. Headphones were distributed followed by a non-alcoholic drink and some salted cashew nuts. After that the crew distributed a hot towel. 45 minutes after departure, the first meal service commenced. There 2 options: chicken with rice or Italian penne pasta. I had the chicken and it was delicious. The meal came with a bottle of water and a drink of your choice, beers and wines were available for free as well. After the meal the cabin crew passed by to collect the empty trays and to serve a cup of coffee or tea with a liquor. Afterwards the lights went out to give passengers a chance to take a nap, immigration cards were handed-out. Half through the flight vanilla ice cream and a cup of water was distributed.

The seat was not very comfortable, the screen for entertainment was tiny, perhaps 10 cm across. Other than more legroom, there are no perks in Premium Economy. Service was perfunctory, which is what I am used from KLM. What was really annoying was a medical emergency, which led us to divert to Luxor. As a doctor, I offered my help, but it appears the decision had already been made, and we stopped in Luxor for about 4 hours to offload a passenger.

No decicated queues for frequent flyers or Comfort Economy. Once onboard, the seats showed their age and lack of comfort on a night flight. In-flight entertainment system is very old, with ancient games, tiny screens, not easy to operate. Choice of films is not too bad. The food was, simply put, inedible. Hardly any drinks service on the night flight - or maybe I missed them as I was trying to sleep. Sleeping is barely possible, as the seats in Comfort Economy are still narrow, even though the legroom is okay. The cabin is noisy. Cabin crew impoite, even rude at times - did not feel welcome. Once in Amsterdam, we learnt that both our connecting flights (to different airports in different countries) had been cancelled. No help from ground staff whatsoever. We finally managed to change our bookings on the self-service machines and were ""compensated"" with a paltry food voucher for 5 EURO and 15 EURO for a 3 hour and a 7 hour delay, respectively.

Yes, but the condition was to ""find a new ticket with a reasonable price close to the initial one"". To be more precise, I paid 98€, they told me I should find something under 150€. If you book a flight the same day, of course all the prices are going to be high! So taking into account the high prices of flights for that day, the service agent made me understand that I won't be fully reimbursed, therefore I'll have to pay extra money. I could finally find a flight for 198€, sent a mail and I'll see if they pay it. An overall opinion is horrible. I had feeling they were mocking me offering a solution which wasn't a solution at all even thought I explained the importance of being in Paris for me.

The customer service will either pick up your call and pretend to not hear you. The funny thing is they put us on a KLM plane on our flight here (not communicated at all and last minute; I wonder how they could suddenly book that).

The only inconvenience we had was a 45 minutes delay, because we had to wait for a free slot to be able to take-off.

Turns out Transavia changed my booking at 8.25am the same morning of my flight because they could not accommodate their overbooking. My new flight was 3 days later!

1451,S Kudriavtsev,Netherlands,2022-05-14,2,"Flight started with severely disorganized and chaotic boarding process. We had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight (at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards, but WTH?) The boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight. As a result, the entire passenger queue, already after passing the passes control, has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded. Obviously, no cleaning of the plane has been done - we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats, those were extremely uncomfortable. They did have an average leg space for a low-cost, I'll give them that, but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either. The armrests could only have been raised halfway, so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders (normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without). I've even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats. Now I'm writing this from home with severe back pain that I've experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and I blame the seats. For the reference, the specific plane was PH-HZX. Curiously enough, the first flight (AMS-SVQ) didn't have these issues - the only thing I can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport, but I expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway.

1452,Vincent Percival,United Arab Emirates,2022-05-12,1,"I have never been so offended by a service provider as this airline. First off, does this company even exist, as far as customer service is concerned, apart from over the phone? There is certainly no customer service at their counter at Schiphol airport. I was just told to get in touch by phone. A ticket I had purchased with them allows me to rebook my flight any number of times during a period of one year. The flight was initially booked for December 2021 but had to be rebooked when the Netherlands went into hard lockdown. I could not rebook the flight for the desired date of December 2022 as the airline had no flight schedule in place for the winter 2022 season. I was therefore forced to rebook the ticket to an unwanted date (March 2022). Come March 2022, their schedule was still not out so I had to rebook to another unwanted date (April 2022), so as not to lose the ticket, incurring extra charges on both occasions, all for no purpose. As the (unwanted) flight date drew near, and, with a winter 2022 schedule still not out and no more available dates left to book past April 2022, I contacted the airline to ask for a voucher/credit but was denied one, resulting in the ticket being forfeited. A customer forfeiting a ticket because of administrative issues i.e. being forced to book unwanted dates only to forfeit the ticket? I have a right to a booking, to hold on to that booking, and to rebook my flight to the desired date. None of those rights have been respected. International flights can be booked a year in advance, apparently not in this instance. What do you call it when an airline forces you to book unwanted dates and incur extra charges only to forfeit your ticket. I have a term for it. Let the reader judge. What makes it worse is their agents’ unprofessionalism and/or deliberate evasion of the subject matter. When I asked them for a voucher and pointed out there were no more dates to rebook their responses, included, for example: ""I understand your situation, however, as per company policies we won't be able to offer you a voucher. Our winter season flight will be out towards the end of April. However, once (they mean “since”) the flight is booked for tomorrow, if you do not want to lose the ticket, please change the route and date of your ticket. You can try and change it for October, so you do not have to change it again before the winter season flights are out.” This is just one example of the astonishing drivel I have received as a response. How can I change the flight for October if there are no flights in October, the subject matter being the Dubai-Amsterdam leg? How can I even “change it again (in April I assume) before the winter season flights are out” when there are no more flights dates left to rebook to? And even if there were, just to incur unnecessary costs? Is this deliberate evasion of the topic or lack of knowledge or what?

This flight was canceled due the weather conditions in Iceland. In order to enter Iceland, we had to do an antigen test prior 72h the entry to the country. Our country of origin was Spain, where we paid €40 for two antigen tests, then we spent two days in Amsterdam and everything was planned in order to have the test still valid to travel to Iceland. Obviously we never took into consideration that our flight was going to be canceled and since that happened, we asked to a lady at Transavia’s counter if we had to repeat the test and her answer was “no, your test will still be valid”. The next day, when we managed to get to Schiphol Airport, we went again to ask at the Transavia’s counter to make sure if we had to do the test, and this time the answer was “yes, otherwise you might not be able to enter in Iceland”. So we repeated the test, which cost us €116. I emailed them that the fact that we had to repeat the test wasn’t our fault and if there was any chance to get a refund, and I didn’t get an answer in more than two months, the first email I sent was on the 13th of January, then again on the 21st of January (no answer from them) and again out the 15th of March, when I’ve been told that they couldn’t do anything because the flight was canceled due the weather conditions. What upsets me the most is the fact that two of their operators gave me two different answers, I’ve never got any apologies from them about this whole situation and they took more than two months to give me an answer.

The employee receiving me at the waiting line informed me that he can't let me proceed to the check-in desk because it is closed. I objected letting him know that it is 45 minutes before the flight and that there is still time to board the plain. I later found out at the Transavia website that the formal SLA is 40 minutes, so he had no right to deny me entrance on that excuse. I convinced him to let me proceed to the desk. While waiting in front of the desk for a decision there was a lot of back and forth between the employee appearing to be in charge next to the desk and the boarding gate. They finally reached the decision to let me in as I was on time. Upon inspecting my PCR test (as an email on my phone), the employee at the desk clicked on a link directing him to the Dutch government website instead of the attached PDF containing the PCR test. In this confusion his instinctive response was to tell me that Transavia doesn't accept this test, although he wasn't looking at the actual PCR certificate but a government web page. I complained saying that I had used Transavia's services 3 months ago with a PCR test from the same authority. Without any sign of self-doubt or hesitation he informed the person in charge that my PCR was invalid.  I was directed to the help desk and talked to the employee there. She asked how much I paid for my certificate and where I had received it. She then proceeded to acknowledge that my PCR was valid and we went together back to the checkin desk. After, informing the staff that they had bounced me off for no reason 10 minutes ago and that they should have let me in, they reverted back to the argument that I had arrived too late anyway. Of course at that point it was indeed too late. So, I guess from my point of view I arrived 5 min before the checkin formally closes with a valid PCR certificate and was denied a service I had paid for. The worst part is that nobody seemed to bother too much about it let alone utter an apology. They were behaving like it is another day at the office and that it sucks for me but rules are rules.

Before boarding the plane, the ground staff asked me to leave my cabin luggage before boarding the plane for the luggage to be checked in, despite the fact there was plenty of room in the overhead compartments. However, my luggage never arrived to the destination. Transavia provided poor information (with supposed ""French speaking staff"" not being able to speak French) on the matter and this airline did not proactively communicate on the fact that the luggage was definitely lost.

However, at least 1 out of 4 times there is a inexplicable delay and their logistics tend to be non-existent when this happens.

Counter-intuitively, there was another flight leaving from the same gate at the same time. Of course it was absolute chaos, further delaying the flight. This also meant that there was not enough seating in the gate area, coincidentally the only bathroom was closed for cleaning, and there was no access to food or beverages except for a vending machine requiring coins.

1546,S Brahim,United States,2017-07-10,2,"✅ Verified Review   Heraklion to Amsterdam. Transavia is the worst airline I have ever been on. I had a flight to Atlanta (with KLM) from Heraklion, through Amsterdam. Flight was booked through Delta airlines. The day of the flight, I arrive 2 hours early to the airport to check in, and after 15 minutes of waiting, the check in agent tells me that I do not exist in their system. I show her the paid for and confirmed flight, she looks again, and says I do not exist. Then, she asks her supervisor to check. This supervisor goes for 45 minutes and comes back saying that she can see my Amsterdam - Atlanta flight, but no flight on Transavia. The reason I was given for the mess was that the Delta ""system"" did not send the reservation to the KLM/Transavia ""system"" (as if that's something I should fix for them!). She then asks me to ""call Delta"", and expects me to resolve a problem that occurred between Transavia and Delta, without my own knowledge! After that, I had to ask her to find me a phone, since I could not use my own to call internationally. She takes me to their reservation desk, and the agents there start shouting at me as if it was my fault that I needed to make a call in their office; a call that they should've done (In fact, I was asked to find the Delta phone number myself!). At that point, my flight had already departed, and after reaching Delta myself (since the Transavia agents never called for me, instead they shouted at me to get out), and being rebooked on a flight the next day, I go to these agents to check whether they can see my reservation. Once again, they say that I don't exist in their system! After another long discussion with them, I was given someone on the phone from Transavia, who said that Delta did indeed book me, but Transavia decided to cancel my flight on their leg twice because of ""payment"". I tried to explain to her that this makes no sense, since my connecting flights are confirmed, I have a payment receipt, a confirmed ticket number from Delta, and everything is in order. She again repeats the same thing. After all this mess, I return to my newly booked hotel, contact Transavia by email. Then, as if it was magic, a few hours after, they send me an email saying that what happened was just a ""mistake"", and they give me my confirmation number.

I'd love to but indeed Transavia does not even give you what you paid or would pay for. Instead they cancel flights on short notice changing your holiday plans (two more days in Israel), change planes, but do not update the prepaid extra leg room seats (no, they just become standard seats: your problem), - are not even able to sell hot drinks on board or have water in the toilets, because obviously somebody forgot to have fresh water loaded onto the plane prior to departure. The flight ""experience"" was still funny though. Cabin crew telling me I cannot use the (completely empty) first row, because these seats would have cost 5€ more than the exit seat I booked but didn't get. Perhaps they were too busy handing out free bottles of water to passengers visiting the lavatories. I have no clue where Transavia ordered the seats, but they were definitely not built for the average European person. I'm not too tall at 1,87m, but still did not fit into that seat. Neither did my seat neighbor from Israel. Although he was a nice person I'd rather not have been in contact with his leg for the whole duration (4 hrs) of the flight. Additionally you are forced to put your carry on luggage under the seat in front of you, which takes away the last chance to move your feet anywhere. Just have a look at the picture attached.

Check-in for the flight left much to be desired - what is the point of having online check-in and no dedicated bag drop counter? Had to queue for nearly 40 minutes in a regular queue to be serviced by an extremely slow check-in agent who didn't know anything about visa requirements. Flight was uneventful and service was ok, two rounds by the cabin attendants for food and drink sales. Arrival into Eindhoven was ahead of schedule, though I had to wait for quite a bit of time for the bags to arrive on the belt.

During check-in they tagged by backpack as ""not guaranteed on board"" and I didn't really mind it being taken to the hold as it was quite big. The plane was only half full though so they let me board with the backpack. The staff was very annoyed that I brought it on board, even though they previously let me through without additional charges and most of the lockers were empty. During the boarding I wanted to ask the staff member to help me find a locker for my hand luggage, she was four rows away from me but couldn't be bothered coming to me, I had to almost scream to her about it! Later she didn't help me with putting the bag inside the locker, though even Ryanair and Wizzair staff help people with their luggage! Next to me was a group of 10 young guys who were really noisy during the whole flight (screaming and shaking my seat!). The passengers were annoyed asked them to be quiet but no one from the staff reacted. While staff was serving drinks (you have to pay 3 euros for tea in Transavia btw) I first said I'm not taking anything, but 20 seconds later changed my mind - the lady was incredibly annoyed by that, said it wasn't my turn to order now ?

1589,Julia Rahm,France,2015-12-15,1,"Total mess of an airline This is the 3rd time flying with Transavia and it will be the last. To begin, every single time I fly with them, they make such a stink, bothering every single person about their baggage. Instead of asking if anyone would like to check their carry-on baggage for free before boarding, knowing that they don't have enough space in the plane (and they know, because it's been a problem every single time I've flied with them), they always tell people to rearrange their baggage so that it fits their requirements during boarding, holding up the line and wasting everyones time. This last trip, our flight was delayed by an hour, and instead of using this time efficiently, to ensure quick and stress-free boarding, the staff did nothing until everyone was in line, when a gruff, rude man immediately tagged my bag as being ""not guaranteed to fit in the plane's carry-on compartments."" My bag weighed 6kg, if not less, and fit exactly their requirements for the smaller carry-on that is granted to every passenger. When we started boarding, the staff was coldly telling every other person in line that they had to put their shopping bags/tiny purses etc. inside their main baggage or their couldn't enter the plane. Everyone is stressed, people are held up waiting in line for everyone to conform to this airline's illogical and stupid rules, and we get delayed another half hour in addition to the lateness of the plane. Not one staff member apologized for the delay except the pilot right before take off, and the same man who tagged my bag earlier seemed to revel in the fact that I had to check it. In addition, the lack of logic to these ridiculous regulations astounds me. Before entering the plane, the staff proclaimed that there was no room on the plane for more baggage, but upon entering, we notice there would be plenty of room for baggage if people were just told to keep their coats under their seats.  One more thing is that this is an airline that likes to blame its client. On my flight from Paris to Barcelona, they decided that it was the fault of the people on the plane who ""didn't respect their baggage policy"" that this was why we were later than normal. And they made this very clear to us. But the real problem was that they forgot to check our IDs at the gate while boarding because they were so distracted harassing people about their bags that they forgot. They forgot to check IDs! Because of bags! Then they had to make everyone get out their baggage from the compartments to check them inside the aircraft. Beyond disorganized - if it wasn't so aggravating it might actually be so ridiculous it's amusing. Like I could almost write a comedy sketch about this. But no. If Transavia could just learn a little logic and basic customer service, maybe they could be an OK low-cost airline.

1590,Dawn Yoon,United States,2015-12-10,1,"In my 27 years of flying, this flight with Transavia was the worst experience I've had, which is saying a lot because I fly with multiple budget airlines. I had already checked in online, but I had to check in again at the counter at the airport. Upon checking in, the gruff clerk weighed my bag and said that I needed to check it in. I had carefully packed the bag in accordance with the carry on rules, which is below 10kg. She stated that the limit was 8kg, which it is not, and I had checked multiple times to ensure this. She begrudgingly let us take it with us, saying it was not guaranteed that it could be carried onto the flight. We were then notified that boarding was delayed. No reasons, no explanation, nothing. We would be updated hourly. 2 hours after the scheduled take off time they finally had us line up for a measly drink voucher. Most of us had been here from early morning and it was nearing noon. Finally, after a delay of about 4 hours, hence wasting our precious time in Paris, we starting boarding. While I am a resident of the States, I am a South Korean National. There were two clerks checking our tickets and passport before going in. My sister, who has the same status as I, was checked by a female clerk, and was let into the plane without a hitch. Then I was check by a male clerk, and he asked if I had a Schengen visa. South Korean Nationals do not require a visa. Then he stated that France has lifted this visa, and was requiring people to have a visa for France specifically. This was merely a rumor and France had not done such a thing. This poorly informed clerk then rudely said that I need a visa when I clearly did not, and upon me showing proof online of such info, he leered at me and told me to step aside as he let everyone else in. After everyone else was let in, he then frantically made calls and checked online himself. As he was reading he realized how he had understood this falsely, and then without even making an eye-contact with me, told me and my sister that we could get onto the flight. No apologies, nothing.

I came 5 min too late to for last check in at the airport due to traffic problems and my confusion of which part of the airport it was - which is my own fault. I did not have any luggage that had to be checked in which made me too optimistic about time needed. When I asked the staff if there is anything to do about that they send me back and forth between different stations of their airline in the flight which made me feel stupid. It would have been nice if they straight away could tell me that it was too late. The lady in information booth was absent for 25 min and empty information booth is unprofessional.

1595,A Goupil,United Kingdom,2015-10-08,1,"No compensation given for misleading statements. I was in Malta and experienced decompression sickness due to diving – 24h after, my airline refused entry to my flight for medical reasons, and said to book a flight with extra oxygen on board. With all flights booked and my airline needing one week to provide oxygen, I call Transavia to book any flight to Europe that can guarantee a bottle of oxygen (I should have been at work already at this time so I decide to try and travel through a connection city back to London). The staff answers that the flight HV5774 from Malta to Amsterdam, 24 hours later, can be booked with a bottle of oxygen guaranteed - I only buy my ticket with them on the basis of the availability of this bottle, otherwise I would choose a different airline, as it is about my medical safety. The booking confirmation says: ""Transavia.com will provide extra oxygen on board"". When I check-in, I ask the employee at the counter if the oxygen is available for me. She makes a call and confirms that the oxygen is available. But once in the plane, a person from Transavia comes and says ""I'm sorry madam but we have no oxygen onboard - are you really going to need it?"" I had to make a call at my own risk and realised that Transavia had falsely stated the availability of oxygen – and not just one time! – and ignored my medical requirements. Desperate to get home as I already had 500€ of extra flight costs, weighting pros and cons, I decide to test my luck and stay on the flight. The person next to me – who happens to be a nurse – found the whole situation unacceptable, and proposed to check out on me regularly during the flight. Then I asked for a small bottle of water to help in case I’m not feeling well. The employees refused to give me the bottle and insisted on me paying 2,70€ if I wanted it.  Finally, the flight arrived with 30min delay, causing me to be unable to pick-up my luggage at the arrival as I would otherwise miss my next flight to London. I had to leave it behind and fill-in a form at the ""lost and found"" in London. (my luggage was “lost” for 5 days). I contacted Transavia to complain. They started by telling me it was my fault because I made my request with “too short a notice” and they need 72 hours. The employee answered then “we cannot give you a refund” and proposed a gift voucher. But I needed to first buy a ticket and then they would refund it (even though they just said that for my complaint no refund is possible – and anyway, who would trust a company that says “we will refund” when they just said “we have extra oxygen” and it was a lie?). Running out of patience I decide to accept the deal. The final joke was when I actually tried to buy a flight: I realised Transavia does not fly from London, so I will never be able to use what I was given! This experience was the worst I had in 20 years of flying and Transavia can be sure they will never see me ever again.

It was quite cheap as it was very last minute and with the departure time of 19.55 it allowed me to get a full days work done before I went. However, I checked in online only to find that when it came to boarding that the system in the airport had not been updated as such and that those of us (the majority it has to be said) who thought we had checked in were not and so had to be manually checked in which took almost an hour. This isn't really the fault of the airline, they blamed the airport, but there was too much confusion in the run up to the point where they opened the flight. The ground staff could see there was an issue and should have opened boarding earlier. The result of which was those with boarding cards issued in the airport got on the plane and were sitting on it for over an hour before the doors closed. Moreover when we eventually took off over an hour late we landed in Orly as the busses were leaving for Paris. No trains, no nothing which meant hanging about waiting to get into the as a result of this it was nearly one am before I got tomy hotel. The flight itself was fine, it's pretty cramped in that spotless cabin with the Boeing Sky Interior, thankfully it was a short flight! The menu range was ok but a little limited looking.

Anyway, yesterday I was flying back from Amsterdam. Once aboard I realized that this was not a Transavia airplane. The staff told me that the flight would be operated by Corendon. Has anyone heard of them before? Well, I hadn't. For me it's important to know a few things about an airline before I fly, concerning the safety in the first place of course. I was so frustrated. They could at least use a KLM airplane which would be acceptable since it's basically the same company. But they can't make passengers fly with an unknown airline. I'm very dissapointed and will avoid to fly with Transavia again.
