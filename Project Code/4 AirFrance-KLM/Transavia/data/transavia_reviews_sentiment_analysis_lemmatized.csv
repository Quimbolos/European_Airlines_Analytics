I had an important, urgent medical appointments on July 7th and 8th morning (thanks to those appointments a surgery was planned). The problem had to be solved immediately, so I contacted them via What'sApp, replies took time, I decided to call them. The call lasted 38 minutes. They offered me 3 solutions : Another flight on for 13th of July. Doesn't work for me. Reimburse my ticket,  but doesn't solve my problem. Get another flight from another company.  Yes, but the condition was to ""find a new ticket with a reasonable price close to the initial one"". To be more precise, I paid 98€, they told me I should find something under 150€. If you book a flight the same day, of course all the prices are going to be high! So taking into account the high prices of flights for that day, the service agent made me understand that I won't be fully reimbursed, therefore I'll have to pay extra money. I could finally find a flight for 198€, sent a mail and I'll see if they pay it. An overall opinion is horrible. I had feeling they were mocking me offering a solution which wasn't a solution at all even thought I explained the importance of being in Paris for me. I'll try to avoid this company in the future as much as I can.

There was no problem with putting my 10kg luggage in a hold for free. Flight attendants were very nice. I had a lot of space for legs and my stuff (my height is 161 cm, my boyfriend's height is 180 cm he could fit comfortably as well).

51,S Kudriavtsev,Netherlands,2022-05-14,2,"Flight started with severely disorganized and chaotic boarding process. We had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight (at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards, but WTH?) The boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight. As a result, the entire passenger queue, already after passing the passes control, has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded. Obviously, no cleaning of the plane has been done - we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats, those were extremely uncomfortable. They did have an average leg space for a low-cost, I'll give them that, but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either. The armrests could only have been raised halfway, so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders (normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without). I've even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats. Now I'm writing this from home with severe back pain that I've experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and I blame the seats. For the reference, the specific plane was PH-HZX. Curiously enough, the first flight (AMS-SVQ) didn't have these issues - the only thing I can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport, but I expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway. In any case, now my stance towards the airline is never again, unless I'm really forced to.",Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seville to Amsterdam,May 2022,1.0,3.0,,,1.0,,2,no,True,Seville,Amsterdam,,Negative,-0.9563,  start severely disorganize chaotic boarding process pay extra priority board hear gate priority board suppose happen least pushed head queue afterwards wth board apparently start land previous result entire passenger queue already passing pass control wait another 20 minute stand wait unloaded obviously clean do found use napkin seat speak seat extremely uncomfortable average leg space give proper head support provide proper back support either armrest raise halfway choice either feel side shoulder normally push armrest seat fly without witnessed one fellow passenger stand aisle read rest seat write home severe back pain experience first time life blame seat reference specific curiously enough first issue thing whine long queuing time airport expect nothing well holiday season anyway case stance towards never unless really force
52,Vincent Percival,United Arab Emirates,2022-05-12,1,"I have never been so offended by a service provider as this airline. First off, does this company even exist, as far as customer service is concerned, apart from over the phone? There is certainly no customer service at their counter at Schiphol airport. I was just told to get in touch by phone. A ticket I had purchased with them allows me to rebook my flight any number of times during a period of one year. The flight was initially booked for December 2021 but had to be rebooked when the Netherlands went into hard lockdown. I could not rebook the flight for the desired date of December 2022 as the airline had no flight schedule in place for the winter 2022 season. I was therefore forced to rebook the ticket to an unwanted date (March 2022). Come March 2022, their schedule was still not out so I had to rebook to another unwanted date (April 2022), so as not to lose the ticket, incurring extra charges on both occasions, all for no purpose. As the (unwanted) flight date drew near, and, with a winter 2022 schedule still not out and no more available dates left to book past April 2022, I contacted the airline to ask for a voucher/credit but was denied one, resulting in the ticket being forfeited. A customer forfeiting a ticket because of administrative issues i.e. being forced to book unwanted dates only to forfeit the ticket? I have a right to a booking, to hold on to that booking, and to rebook my flight to the desired date. None of those rights have been respected. International flights can be booked a year in advance, apparently not in this instance. What do you call it when an airline forces you to book unwanted dates and incur extra charges only to forfeit your ticket. I have a term for it. Let the reader judge. What makes it worse is their agents’ unprofessionalism and/or deliberate evasion of the subject matter. When I asked them for a voucher and pointed out there were no more dates to rebook their responses, included, for example: ""I understand your situation, however, as per company policies we won't be able to offer you a voucher. Our winter season flight will be out towards the end of April. However, once (they mean “since”) the flight is booked for tomorrow, if you do not want to lose the ticket, please change the route and date of your ticket. You can try and change it for October, so you do not have to change it again before the winter season flights are out.” This is just one example of the astonishing drivel I have received as a response. How can I change the flight for October if there are no flights in October, the subject matter being the Dubai-Amsterdam leg? How can I even “change it again (in April I assume) before the winter season flights are out” when there are no more flights dates left to rebook to? And even if there were, just to incur unnecessary costs? Is this deliberate evasion of the topic or lack of knowledge or what? Not only am I unnecessarily out of pocket, I’m without recourse, having contacted every relevant body. Thank you Transavia. I’ve been flying with you annually for the past 7 years.

A couple of weeks after buying my non-refundable ticket, they canceled the flight. They offered a new flight, that was not suitable to me, as well a the refund option, that I chose. They inform they would refund within 2 weeks. The following weeks, they went on sending the same information about flight cancelation, and I could check my reservation had not been cancelled. They did not refund me. Suddenly i received an email remembering check-in policies. Therefore I called their ""service center"", that was quick to answer. They indeed then cancelled my reservation, and said I would receive a refund within 2 weeks. Immediately after my call, I received an email from Transavia stating that I had decided to cancel a non-refundable reservation, and therefore would not be allowed to refund. I called again, and they said they kind-of fixed it. Then I received an email, informing of a refund on process. So far, no money; I understand that airline suffers from financial troubles.

69,Ieremias Athanasiadis,Netherlands,2021-05-22,1,"I arrived at checkin at 08.30 with the flight departing at 9.15. The employee receiving me at the waiting line informed me that he can't let me proceed to the check-in desk because it is closed. I objected letting him know that it is 45 minutes before the flight and that there is still time to board the plain. I later found out at the Transavia website that the formal SLA is 40 minutes, so he had no right to deny me entrance on that excuse. I convinced him to let me proceed to the desk. While waiting in front of the desk for a decision there was a lot of back and forth between the employee appearing to be in charge next to the desk and the boarding gate. They finally reached the decision to let me in as I was on time. Upon inspecting my PCR test (as an email on my phone), the employee at the desk clicked on a link directing him to the Dutch government website instead of the attached PDF containing the PCR test. In this confusion his instinctive response was to tell me that Transavia doesn't accept this test, although he wasn't looking at the actual PCR certificate but a government web page. I complained saying that I had used Transavia's services 3 months ago with a PCR test from the same authority. Without any sign of self-doubt or hesitation he informed the person in charge that my PCR was invalid.  I was directed to the help desk and talked to the employee there. She asked how much I paid for my certificate and where I had received it. She then proceeded to acknowledge that my PCR was valid and we went together back to the checkin desk. After, informing the staff that they had bounced me off for no reason 10 minutes ago and that they should have let me in, they reverted back to the argument that I had arrived too late anyway. Of course at that point it was indeed too late. So, I guess from my point of view I arrived 5 min before the checkin formally closes with a valid PCR certificate and was denied a service I had paid for. The worst part is that nobody seemed to bother too much about it let alone utter an apology. They were behaving like it is another day at the office and that it sucks for me but rules are rules.

78,Elaine Loh,Netherlands,2020-08-17,4,"We paid extra and booked the exit row seats, which the Transavia website said was possible if children 12 to 16 are accompanied by an adult. However, when we arrived at the airport, we were told that we could not have the exit row seat as my son was 12 and that Transavia had changed our seats to another standard row. I told the ground staff that the website had indicated it was possible, which is the reason for us booking. This resulted in some confusion but we managed to get the seats that we paid for eventually. This is the 2nd time that Transavia had shifted us without consent, and both times, we had to rectify.

There is no flight to Dublin today. It’s tomorrow. Your boarding pass is correct, but there is no flight. Go to the Transavia counter.” There we were told to call a number to get a refund after 8:00 am. Our phones were not connecting in France, so impossible, and there is no public phone in the airport.

However, at least 1 out of 4 times there is a inexplicable delay and their logistics tend to be non-existent when this happens. For the morning Amsterdam to Orly flight on 8 March, flight was delayed at first for 30 minutes, so the gate was moved to a bus-out gate in the basement of Schiphol airport. Counter-intuitively, there was another flight leaving from the same gate at the same time. Of course it was absolute chaos, further delaying the flight. This also meant that there was not enough seating in the gate area, coincidentally the only bathroom was closed for cleaning, and there was no access to food or beverages except for a vending machine requiring coins.
