I am allergic to cheese, so there was no option to eat something decent! It’s the worst food options I ever saw with all airlines I flew with in my life.

I had an important, urgent medical appointments on July 7th and 8th morning (thanks to those appointments a surgery was planned). The problem had to be solved immediately, so I contacted them via What'sApp, replies took time, I decided to call them. The call lasted 38 minutes. They offered me 3 solutions : Another flight on for 13th of July. Doesn't work for me. Reimburse my ticket,  but doesn't solve my problem. Get another flight from another company.  Yes, but the condition was to ""find a new ticket with a reasonable price close to the initial one"". To be more precise, I paid 98€, they told me I should find something under 150€. If you book a flight the same day, of course all the prices are going to be high! So taking into account the high prices of flights for that day, the service agent made me understand that I won't be fully reimbursed, therefore I'll have to pay extra money. I could finally find a flight for 198€, sent a mail and I'll see if they pay it. An overall opinion is horrible. I had feeling they were mocking me offering a solution which wasn't a solution at all even thought I explained the importance of being in Paris for me. I'll try to avoid this company in the future as much as I can.

42,A Foley,Ireland,2022-07-29,8,"Booked KLM Cork to Seville via Amsterdam with Amsterdam Seville legs flown with Transavia. Overall can’t really complain. They are effectively the charter leg of KLM and as such pretty much like most charters. Unlike KLM legs any food /drink was purchase only, didn’t buy anything but prices were reasonable. Seats were pretty standard legroom not great not poor …. I kinda liked the green leather though some may find it a bit garish. Most reviews not great but I found them fine. On time crews were again really friendly and polite, worked hard to help passengers find luggage space . Also special mention to the Transavia guy in Seville who noticed my lad had a football he had purchased. He told us it needed to be deflated a little to compensate for aircraft pressure. We had nothing to deflate it with but he asked a lady in the check in queue for her hair clip and then spent 10 minutes using this to get it deflated - much to the amusement of the waiting passengers! All done with a smile so while others may have issues we had a positive experience so feel that deserves to be said.

43,O Vierelale,United States,2022-07-28,9,"We were supposed to fly from Corfu, to Paris Orly airport and catch a connection from Paris Orly to Biarritz. We had two hours for the connection in Paris, which was tight since we had to retrieve our luggage and register them again. This was very clear from the beginning when I bought the tickets, so no question about it. Because of chaotic conditions in Corfu (widely understaffed for the first big summer vacation week end since Covid), we departed 2 hours late. The captain was good at communicating about the situation. I inquired with the cabin crew about my very short connection. Since I purchased the extra insurance to cover any travel interruption  he told me that their mission was to take us and our luggage to the final destination. As we were flying over Italy, the captain was able to communicate with the ground crew in Paris about our situation, the cabin crew checked our boarding pass for next flight, asked me about the color, size and brand of our luggage. We deboarded the plane and waited  outside the plane door as the cleaning crew was inside. Ground crew personally confirmed our luggage has been identified and was staying inside the plane. We then started boarding again with the new flight crew.

We had paid extra for priority boarding only to hear at the gate that no priority boarding is supposed to happen on this flight (at least we were pushed to the head of the queue afterwards, but WTH?) The boarding itself apparently was started before the plane has even landed after its previous flight. As a result, the entire passenger queue, already after passing the passes control, has been waiting for another 20 minutes standing and waiting while the plane was being unloaded. Obviously, no cleaning of the plane has been done - we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats, those were extremely uncomfortable. They did have an average leg space for a low-cost, I'll give them that, but they had no proper head support and did not provide proper back support either. The armrests could only have been raised halfway, so you had a choice to either feel them at your sides or at your shoulders (normally we would just push the armrest between our seats up and fly without). I've even witnessed one of our fellow passengers standing up at the aisle for a while to read and rest from these seats. Now I'm writing this from home with severe back pain that I've experienced for the first time in my life after this flight and I blame the seats. For the reference, the specific plane was PH-HZX. Curiously enough, the first flight (AMS-SVQ) didn't have these issues - the only thing I can whine about was the long queuing time at the airport, but I expected nothing better during the holiday season anyway.

52,Vincent Percival,United Arab Emirates,2022-05-12,1,"I have never been so offended by a service provider as this airline. First off, does this company even exist, as far as customer service is concerned, apart from over the phone? There is certainly no customer service at their counter at Schiphol airport. I was just told to get in touch by phone. A ticket I had purchased with them allows me to rebook my flight any number of times during a period of one year. The flight was initially booked for December 2021 but had to be rebooked when the Netherlands went into hard lockdown. I could not rebook the flight for the desired date of December 2022 as the airline had no flight schedule in place for the winter 2022 season. I was therefore forced to rebook the ticket to an unwanted date (March 2022). Come March 2022, their schedule was still not out so I had to rebook to another unwanted date (April 2022), so as not to lose the ticket, incurring extra charges on both occasions, all for no purpose. As the (unwanted) flight date drew near, and, with a winter 2022 schedule still not out and no more available dates left to book past April 2022, I contacted the airline to ask for a voucher/credit but was denied one, resulting in the ticket being forfeited. A customer forfeiting a ticket because of administrative issues i.e. being forced to book unwanted dates only to forfeit the ticket? I have a right to a booking, to hold on to that booking, and to rebook my flight to the desired date. None of those rights have been respected. International flights can be booked a year in advance, apparently not in this instance. What do you call it when an airline forces you to book unwanted dates and incur extra charges only to forfeit your ticket. I have a term for it. Let the reader judge. What makes it worse is their agents’ unprofessionalism and/or deliberate evasion of the subject matter. When I asked them for a voucher and pointed out there were no more dates to rebook their responses, included, for example: ""I understand your situation, however, as per company policies we won't be able to offer you a voucher. Our winter season flight will be out towards the end of April. However, once (they mean “since”) the flight is booked for tomorrow, if you do not want to lose the ticket, please change the route and date of your ticket. You can try and change it for October, so you do not have to change it again before the winter season flights are out.” This is just one example of the astonishing drivel I have received as a response. How can I change the flight for October if there are no flights in October, the subject matter being the Dubai-Amsterdam leg? How can I even “change it again (in April I assume) before the winter season flights are out” when there are no more flights dates left to rebook to? And even if there were, just to incur unnecessary costs? Is this deliberate evasion of the topic or lack of knowledge or what?

This flight was canceled due the weather conditions in Iceland. In order to enter Iceland, we had to do an antigen test prior 72h the entry to the country. Our country of origin was Spain, where we paid €40 for two antigen tests, then we spent two days in Amsterdam and everything was planned in order to have the test still valid to travel to Iceland. Obviously we never took into consideration that our flight was going to be canceled and since that happened, we asked to a lady at Transavia’s counter if we had to repeat the test and her answer was “no, your test will still be valid”. The next day, when we managed to get to Schiphol Airport, we went again to ask at the Transavia’s counter to make sure if we had to do the test, and this time the answer was “yes, otherwise you might not be able to enter in Iceland”. So we repeated the test, which cost us €116. I emailed them that the fact that we had to repeat the test wasn’t our fault and if there was any chance to get a refund, and I didn’t get an answer in more than two months, the first email I sent was on the 13th of January, then again on the 21st of January (no answer from them) and again out the 15th of March, when I’ve been told that they couldn’t do anything because the flight was canceled due the weather conditions. What upsets me the most is the fact that two of their operators gave me two different answers, I’ve never got any apologies from them about this whole situation and they took more than two months to give me an answer.

The employee receiving me at the waiting line informed me that he can't let me proceed to the check-in desk because it is closed. I objected letting him know that it is 45 minutes before the flight and that there is still time to board the plain. I later found out at the Transavia website that the formal SLA is 40 minutes, so he had no right to deny me entrance on that excuse. I convinced him to let me proceed to the desk. While waiting in front of the desk for a decision there was a lot of back and forth between the employee appearing to be in charge next to the desk and the boarding gate. They finally reached the decision to let me in as I was on time. Upon inspecting my PCR test (as an email on my phone), the employee at the desk clicked on a link directing him to the Dutch government website instead of the attached PDF containing the PCR test. In this confusion his instinctive response was to tell me that Transavia doesn't accept this test, although he wasn't looking at the actual PCR certificate but a government web page. I complained saying that I had used Transavia's services 3 months ago with a PCR test from the same authority. Without any sign of self-doubt or hesitation he informed the person in charge that my PCR was invalid.  I was directed to the help desk and talked to the employee there. She asked how much I paid for my certificate and where I had received it. She then proceeded to acknowledge that my PCR was valid and we went together back to the checkin desk. After, informing the staff that they had bounced me off for no reason 10 minutes ago and that they should have let me in, they reverted back to the argument that I had arrived too late anyway. Of course at that point it was indeed too late. So, I guess from my point of view I arrived 5 min before the checkin formally closes with a valid PCR certificate and was denied a service I had paid for. The worst part is that nobody seemed to bother too much about it let alone utter an apology. They were behaving like it is another day at the office and that it sucks for me but rules are rules. Bouncing off people like that might be ok if we are talking about trains or buses because you can catch the next one.

Flight itself was generally OK but the cabin was very hot and it was only about half an hour after take off that it cooled down. Booked the front row seats for me and my friend and it was comfortable for a short flight. However on the ground service was not great. This was partly because the flight was out of Orly and between dropping off luggage, passing through security and immigration took about an hour and a half.

The planes are newer and flight attendants are very nice. However, my experience attempting to check a bag was an absolute nightmare. I paid for this service ahead of time, had my boarding pass already downloaded on my phone, so I simply needed to drop my bag. I waited 1.5 hours in line and when I got to the front I was finally able to get someone's attention. He told me I no longer had time to check my bag because the gate was closed. I'm sure others had a similar problem because the line was probably about 3 hours long when I left. I had 2 bottles of champagne in my bag that I simply had to leave on the ground and I ran to my gate (and still had about 30 min of waiting time when I got there). When I emailed the airline to request a refund and to tell them about my experience, they unapologetically refused to pay back my 19 euros. Said I should have gotten there 3 hours earlier to check a bag.

146,S Brahim,United States,2017-07-10,2,"✅ Verified Review   Heraklion to Amsterdam. Transavia is the worst airline I have ever been on. I had a flight to Atlanta (with KLM) from Heraklion, through Amsterdam. Flight was booked through Delta airlines. The day of the flight, I arrive 2 hours early to the airport to check in, and after 15 minutes of waiting, the check in agent tells me that I do not exist in their system. I show her the paid for and confirmed flight, she looks again, and says I do not exist. Then, she asks her supervisor to check. This supervisor goes for 45 minutes and comes back saying that she can see my Amsterdam - Atlanta flight, but no flight on Transavia. The reason I was given for the mess was that the Delta ""system"" did not send the reservation to the KLM/Transavia ""system"" (as if that's something I should fix for them!). She then asks me to ""call Delta"", and expects me to resolve a problem that occurred between Transavia and Delta, without my own knowledge! After that, I had to ask her to find me a phone, since I could not use my own to call internationally. She takes me to their reservation desk, and the agents there start shouting at me as if it was my fault that I needed to make a call in their office; a call that they should've done (In fact, I was asked to find the Delta phone number myself!). At that point, my flight had already departed, and after reaching Delta myself (since the Transavia agents never called for me, instead they shouted at me to get out), and being rebooked on a flight the next day, I go to these agents to check whether they can see my reservation. Once again, they say that I don't exist in their system! After another long discussion with them, I was given someone on the phone from Transavia, who said that Delta did indeed book me, but Transavia decided to cancel my flight on their leg twice because of ""payment"". I tried to explain to her that this makes no sense, since my connecting flights are confirmed, I have a payment receipt, a confirmed ticket number from Delta, and everything is in order. She again repeats the same thing. After all this mess, I return to my newly booked hotel, contact Transavia by email. Then, as if it was magic, a few hours after, they send me an email saying that what happened was just a ""mistake"", and they give me my confirmation number.

Instead they cancel flights on short notice changing your holiday plans (two more days in Israel), change planes, but do not update the prepaid extra leg room seats (no, they just become standard seats: your problem), - are not even able to sell hot drinks on board or have water in the toilets, because obviously somebody forgot to have fresh water loaded onto the plane prior to departure. The flight ""experience"" was still funny though. Cabin crew telling me I cannot use the (completely empty) first row, because these seats would have cost 5€ more than the exit seat I booked but didn't get. Perhaps they were too busy handing out free bottles of water to passengers visiting the lavatories. I have no clue where Transavia ordered the seats, but they were definitely not built for the average European person. I'm not too tall at 1,87m, but still did not fit into that seat. Neither did my seat neighbor from Israel. Although he was a nice person I'd rather not have been in contact with his leg for the whole duration (4 hrs) of the flight. Additionally you are forced to put your carry on luggage under the seat in front of you, which takes away the last chance to move your feet anywhere. Just have a look at the picture attached.

The flight was delayed by almost an hour and a half. The problem we were informed was because of an engine fault. I understand that there can be an engine fault but what I cannot understand is why we had to sit in 30 degree of heat for so long. Surely if there was a fault the engineering staff preparing the aircraft for flight should have spotted the problem in the first instance. There was very little information given to the passengers during this time. All we saw was engineers going to and fro through the captains cabin. The pilots also at one stage left the aircraft leaving the passengers both bewildered and confused. Then just to add salt to the wound I had to pay for a cup of coffee. This happened, I might also add, on a very early morning flight when most or all of the passengers would not have had breakfast.

Flight was uneventful and service was ok, two rounds by the cabin attendants for food and drink sales.

During the boarding I wanted to ask the staff member to help me find a locker for my hand luggage, she was four rows away from me but couldn't be bothered coming to me, I had to almost scream to her about it! Later she didn't help me with putting the bag inside the locker, though even Ryanair and Wizzair staff help people with their luggage! Next to me was a group of 10 young guys who were really noisy during the whole flight (screaming and shaking my seat!). The passengers were annoyed asked them to be quiet but no one from the staff reacted. While staff was serving drinks (you have to pay 3 euros for tea in Transavia btw) I first said I'm not taking anything, but 20 seconds later changed my mind - the lady was incredibly annoyed by that, said it wasn't my turn to order now ?

189,Julia Rahm,France,2015-12-15,1,"Total mess of an airline This is the 3rd time flying with Transavia and it will be the last. To begin, every single time I fly with them, they make such a stink, bothering every single person about their baggage. Instead of asking if anyone would like to check their carry-on baggage for free before boarding, knowing that they don't have enough space in the plane (and they know, because it's been a problem every single time I've flied with them), they always tell people to rearrange their baggage so that it fits their requirements during boarding, holding up the line and wasting everyones time. This last trip, our flight was delayed by an hour, and instead of using this time efficiently, to ensure quick and stress-free boarding, the staff did nothing until everyone was in line, when a gruff, rude man immediately tagged my bag as being ""not guaranteed to fit in the plane's carry-on compartments."" My bag weighed 6kg, if not less, and fit exactly their requirements for the smaller carry-on that is granted to every passenger. When we started boarding, the staff was coldly telling every other person in line that they had to put their shopping bags/tiny purses etc. inside their main baggage or their couldn't enter the plane. Everyone is stressed, people are held up waiting in line for everyone to conform to this airline's illogical and stupid rules, and we get delayed another half hour in addition to the lateness of the plane. Not one staff member apologized for the delay except the pilot right before take off, and the same man who tagged my bag earlier seemed to revel in the fact that I had to check it. In addition, the lack of logic to these ridiculous regulations astounds me. Before entering the plane, the staff proclaimed that there was no room on the plane for more baggage, but upon entering, we notice there would be plenty of room for baggage if people were just told to keep their coats under their seats.  One more thing is that this is an airline that likes to blame its client. On my flight from Paris to Barcelona, they decided that it was the fault of the people on the plane who ""didn't respect their baggage policy"" that this was why we were later than normal. And they made this very clear to us. But the real problem was that they forgot to check our IDs at the gate while boarding because they were so distracted harassing people about their bags that they forgot. They forgot to check IDs! Because of bags! Then they had to make everyone get out their baggage from the compartments to check them inside the aircraft. Beyond disorganized - if it wasn't so aggravating it might actually be so ridiculous it's amusing. Like I could almost write a comedy sketch about this. But no. If Transavia could just learn a little logic and basic customer service, maybe they could be an OK low-cost airline.

190,Dawn Yoon,United States,2015-12-10,1,"In my 27 years of flying, this flight with Transavia was the worst experience I've had, which is saying a lot because I fly with multiple budget airlines. I had already checked in online, but I had to check in again at the counter at the airport. Upon checking in, the gruff clerk weighed my bag and said that I needed to check it in. I had carefully packed the bag in accordance with the carry on rules, which is below 10kg. She stated that the limit was 8kg, which it is not, and I had checked multiple times to ensure this. She begrudgingly let us take it with us, saying it was not guaranteed that it could be carried onto the flight. We were then notified that boarding was delayed. No reasons, no explanation, nothing. We would be updated hourly. 2 hours after the scheduled take off time they finally had us line up for a measly drink voucher. Most of us had been here from early morning and it was nearing noon. Finally, after a delay of about 4 hours, hence wasting our precious time in Paris, we starting boarding. While I am a resident of the States, I am a South Korean National. There were two clerks checking our tickets and passport before going in. My sister, who has the same status as I, was checked by a female clerk, and was let into the plane without a hitch. Then I was check by a male clerk, and he asked if I had a Schengen visa. South Korean Nationals do not require a visa. Then he stated that France has lifted this visa, and was requiring people to have a visa for France specifically. This was merely a rumor and France had not done such a thing. This poorly informed clerk then rudely said that I need a visa when I clearly did not, and upon me showing proof online of such info, he leered at me and told me to step aside as he let everyone else in. After everyone else was let in, he then frantically made calls and checked online himself. As he was reading he realized how he had understood this falsely, and then without even making an eye-contact with me, told me and my sister that we could get onto the flight. No apologies, nothing.

195,A Goupil,United Kingdom,2015-10-08,1,"No compensation given for misleading statements. I was in Malta and experienced decompression sickness due to diving – 24h after, my airline refused entry to my flight for medical reasons, and said to book a flight with extra oxygen on board. With all flights booked and my airline needing one week to provide oxygen, I call Transavia to book any flight to Europe that can guarantee a bottle of oxygen (I should have been at work already at this time so I decide to try and travel through a connection city back to London). The staff answers that the flight HV5774 from Malta to Amsterdam, 24 hours later, can be booked with a bottle of oxygen guaranteed - I only buy my ticket with them on the basis of the availability of this bottle, otherwise I would choose a different airline, as it is about my medical safety. The booking confirmation says: ""Transavia.com will provide extra oxygen on board"". When I check-in, I ask the employee at the counter if the oxygen is available for me. She makes a call and confirms that the oxygen is available. But once in the plane, a person from Transavia comes and says ""I'm sorry madam but we have no oxygen onboard - are you really going to need it?"" I had to make a call at my own risk and realised that Transavia had falsely stated the availability of oxygen – and not just one time! – and ignored my medical requirements. Desperate to get home as I already had 500€ of extra flight costs, weighting pros and cons, I decide to test my luck and stay on the flight. The person next to me – who happens to be a nurse – found the whole situation unacceptable, and proposed to check out on me regularly during the flight. Then I asked for a small bottle of water to help in case I’m not feeling well. The employees refused to give me the bottle and insisted on me paying 2,70€ if I wanted it.  Finally, the flight arrived with 30min delay, causing me to be unable to pick-up my luggage at the arrival as I would otherwise miss my next flight to London. I had to leave it behind and fill-in a form at the ""lost and found"" in London. (my luggage was “lost” for 5 days). I contacted Transavia to complain. They started by telling me it was my fault because I made my request with “too short a notice” and they need 72 hours. The employee answered then “we cannot give you a refund” and proposed a gift voucher. But I needed to first buy a ticket and then they would refund it (even though they just said that for my complaint no refund is possible – and anyway, who would trust a company that says “we will refund” when they just said “we have extra oxygen” and it was a lie?). Running out of patience I decide to accept the deal. The final joke was when I actually tried to buy a flight: I realised Transavia does not fly from London, so I will never be able to use what I was given! This experience was the worst I had in 20 years of flying and Transavia can be sure they will never see me ever again.

However, I checked in online only to find that when it came to boarding that the system in the airport had not been updated as such and that those of us (the majority it has to be said) who thought we had checked in were not and so had to be manually checked in which took almost an hour. This isn't really the fault of the airline, they blamed the airport, but there was too much confusion in the run up to the point where they opened the flight. The ground staff could see there was an issue and should have opened boarding earlier. The result of which was those with boarding cards issued in the airport got on the plane and were sitting on it for over an hour before the doors closed. Moreover when we eventually took off over an hour late we landed in Orly as the busses were leaving for Paris. No trains, no nothing which meant hanging about waiting to get into the as a result of this it was nearly one am before I got tomy hotel.

Anyway, yesterday I was flying back from Amsterdam. Once aboard I realized that this was not a Transavia airplane. The staff told me that the flight would be operated by Corendon. Has anyone heard of them before? Well, I hadn't. For me it's important to know a few things about an airline before I fly, concerning the safety in the first place of course. I was so frustrated. They could at least use a KLM airplane which would be acceptable since it's basically the same company. But they can't make passengers fly with an unknown airline.
