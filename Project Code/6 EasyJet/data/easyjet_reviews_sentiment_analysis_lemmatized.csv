0,L Geronia,Australia,2023-11-14,1,"Terrible airline with horrible online customer service. My flight from Milan to Prague itself was fine, but it was the issue I encountered a week beforehand which will be the reason I would never fly with Easyjet ever again. I was forced to cancel my flight from Naples to Athens due to an injury I sustained whilst on my European vacation. This flight was not refunded to me despite having purchased their travel insurance they offer when buying plane tickets on their website. When I made the claim they informed me that in the fine print of their terms and conditions, this travel insurance is only valid for Italian citizens. So essentially they sold me a service that they knew would not be valid if claimed by any international travellers. This sort of deceptive business tactics shows nothing less of the poor ethics this company has towards its customers.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Prague,July 2023,,,,,,,1,no,True,Milan,Prague,,Negative,-0.7553,  terrible horrible online customer service milan prague fine issue encounter week beforehand reason never fly ever force cancel naples athens due injury sustain whilst european vacation refund despite purchase travel insurance offer buy ticket website make claim informed fine print term condition travel insurance valid italian citizen essentially sell service know valid claim international traveller sort deceptive business tactic show nothing less poor ethic company towards customer

Arrived early. Crew seemed upbeat and friendly. Return flight from Faro to Glasgow 28/10/23 was a different story. Faro was a disaster. Check in/baggage drop was at the very far end of the check in desks and was queued out the door. 1 person manning the desk. Eventually someone else appeared then the check in changed to Glasgow and Belfast with just 2 people manning it. The queue by this stage was crazy. Eventually they opened up more desks but took nearly an hour to drop off bags. Next was security, queued out again with only a few channels open. Took a further 25 mins to get through this. Then passport control, once again queued out with only a couple of desks open. I suspect had our hotel transfer not been early we could have easily missed the flight as we only ha a short time after arriving at the gate before boarding started.

4,B James,United Kingdom,2023-11-01,1,"During flight EZY8035, the 16.35 from Gatwick to Tenerife South on 18th July 2023, the seat (about 13c) of my son was given to another passenger. My son is a full-fare paying passenger (although less than 16 so I am writing this on their behalf). After boarding and takeoff as normal, the seat was momentarily vacated. A passenger in the same row lay down and started to occupy the seat. Neither my son nor I were asked for consent or even informed of this action. All I could tell was a passenger who looked as though they were recovering from a heavy night and wanted a lie down to recover. To enable this, my son had to sacrifice their seat for an indefinite length of time. I raised my issue with the aircrew. My concern was passed between two cabin crew and escalated to their superior. I was told that as I'd momentarily vacated, I had to maintain this status quo and sacrifice my son's seat. No alternative was offered. No timeframe was given. The only option I was presented was for both my son and I to squeeze into the same seat. It transpired the situation lasted for the majority of the flight. The FAA states ""The safest place for your child ... is not in your lap"". Yet this is the situation I found myself in and had to try to explain to my son. When I escalated my concerns, the best the senior cabin crew could offer was advice I should write to customer services and request a refund for my son's seat. I followed this advice.

5,Peter Meikle,United Kingdom,2023-10-03,5,"A very mixed bag. As a party of 4 we each booked and paid for 15kg hold luggage, before departure, I received an email saying we had 23kg. 3 of us had about 10kg and one went for 23kg. bag drop at Bristol was exemplary, machines worked well and helpful staff on standby to assist - no mention of extra fee. Bordeaux departure was mess, it says Billi L on the boarding pass, but who would know that that meant a shed at the end of the main terminal that was for low cost airlines - all the Departures signage coming from the hire car drop zone is to the main terminal in the opposite direction. At bag drop there was initially only 1 person sitting at a desk who was more interested in talking to colleagues rather than check in passengers' luggage. Then 2 more arrived and a panic to pull forward passengers travelling to Palma and Marseilles. The last member of our party was charged 45 euros for excess baggage despite having the same baggage as on the outbound flight. The rest of the boarding procedure was an equally overcrowded, hot and unpleasant experience. Why not use the main terminal, especially now it is about empty following France's partial domestic flight ban. Low visibility at Bristol resulted in an aborted landing followed by diversion to Cardiff. The crew were excellent, they kept us informed throughout, the captain stood at the front of the cabin and gave updates directly.

6,P Galleno,United States,2023-09-30,1,"I have flown with easyJet several times in previous years, but this time I had the unfortunate experience of learning about their handling of flight cancellations. First, I should note that the easyJet terminal at Schipol Airport is separate from all other airlines and has inadequate seating and very limited services. My flight from Amsterdam to Naples was canceled about 30 mins before the departure time, without any prior notice whatsoever that there might be any problems. There were no easyJet staff available to explain what to do. Asking other passengers with previous experience of easyJet cancellations was the only option. I went to the easyJet desk in the baggage claim area but the staff did nothing to help the stranded passengers. Recovering my checked package took 2 hours. After a long delay, the easyJet app offered the option to rebook on another flight, but in fact there were no other flights to Naples, Rome or Milan during the following two days.

7,N Abbot ,United Kingdom,2023-09-25,3,"Pretty poor performance by easyJet at their “focus city” of Naples. Whilst bag-drop was straightforward and easy, getting through passport control was a total nightmare. At least a couple of hundred passengers were trying to reach the immigration booths at the B gates but were prevented by doing so by temporary barriers erected ostensibly to control the crowds but which instead resulted in passengers being kettled and trapped in scary conditions (i.e. risk of being crushed and little to no working air conditioning). One could argue this is the airport’s responsibility rather than the airlines’, but both Ryanair and jet2 sent their staff to the barriers to allow ONLY their passengers past the barriers; easyJet passengers were not allowed through and had to wait for other airline passengers to pass through and then slip through behind them whenever they could. EasyJet did not send down any staff to advocate for their passengers stuck behind the barriers and it was the most chaotic crowd I have ever seen waiting to be stamped out of any country. As a result, our flight was delayed by one hour simply because half of the passengers were still waiting to clear passport control (I overheard one of the ground staff confirm this to the cabin crew after I had been able to finally board). The flight itself was fine, but the experience at Naples airport was harrowing and it was upsetting to see how other low cost airlines bothered to get their passengers passed the barrier whilst easyJet staff were nowhere to be seen.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Naples to London Gatwick,September 2023,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,,4,no,True,Naples,London,,Negative,-0.9432,  pretty poor performance focus city naples whilst straightforward easy get passport control total nightmare least couple hundred passenger try reach immigration booth b gate prevent temporary barrier erect ostensibly control crowd instead result passenger kettled trapped scary condition risk crush little work air condition one argue airport responsibility rather ryanair jet2 send staff barrier allow passenger past barrier passenger allow wait passenger pass slip behind whenever send staff advocate passenger stick behind barrier chaotic crowd ever see wait stamped country result delayed one hour simply half passenger still wait clear passport control overheard one ground staff confirm cabin crew able finally board fine experience naples airport harrow upset see low cost bother get passenger pass barrier whilst staff nowhere see

First, buying a ticket is full of pop ups and weird advertising jumping in your way; glitches and more glitches; their boarding is always last minute; at the entry in the lounge you see the fed up, grumpy, not well-mannered staff; the staff always try to find something on you to charge you extra. On my last trip there's this staff member in LGW, not very presentable, checking the boarding passes - he asked many travellers to insert their baggage in a tiny space to verify the measurements; if it was half an inch bigger than that, then he tells the travellers that would be £48 extra charge.

11,Stefanie Schoeninger,Germany,2023-09-15,1,"From my understanding I booked a flight from Berlin to Milan the day before yesterday. Afterwards I received a confirmation email saying the flight departs in Prague and flies to Milan. After I saw that email I immediately called EasyJet's customer service which was more useless. First he told me that there are no flights from Berlin to Milan at all and that I cannot change my flights at all. When I advised him that the airport is called Milan LIN that EasyJet planes fly to from Berlin, he told me that it would be cheaper for me to just make a new booking as it would be cheaper. However, I would still have to pay for those wrong flights from and to Prague since the booking has been made more than 24 hours ago. I asked him if there are any exceptions because obviously there must be a mistake (and it's possible that this mistake was made by the airline, because why would I book a flight from Prague) but he told me there's nothing that he can do for me. I went online and changed the flights on the website myself. There is no option to change both flights (there and return) at the same time, so I had to pay rebooking fees twice. Moreover there were no suitable return flights available anymore that leave in the evening, so now I had to take one a day later and have to pay for another night at the hotel. All in total I've paid now close to $900 AUD for flights + extra night at the hotel in Milan for one short trip from Berlin to Milan and return, because most likely there is some sort of bug in the system (either skyscanner or easyjet). This is more than frustrating!

13,N Anderson,United Kingdom,2023-08-29,8,"Overall good trip. Baggage drop was quick and easy and staff were friendly. Poor boarding management at Luton airport, however. Boarding was via stairs and those allocated to board at the rear of the plane boarded as normal whereas those allocated to board via the front stairs were made to queue for around 15 to 20 minutes, standing on the tarmac. Later I discovered by chance that this was to allow a disabled passenger to be loaded first. This is understandable (and I don't mind waiting for that reason) but the failing of easyJet was that they did not communicate this reason to us whilst we were standing in the queue, not knowing what was going on.

23,D Andrews,United Kingdom,2023-07-21,1,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and sheer frustration with the appalling service I experienced during my recent flight with EasyJet on 20th July 2023. My journey with your airline, on Flight EZY8312 from Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick, was an absolute nightmare from the very outset. To begin with, all the electronic check-in gates at Milan Malpensa Airport were either out of order or deliberately switched off, resulting in an infuriatingly slow and chaotic process. It was quite an ordeal to witness the incompetence of the ground staff, and to add to the misery, there was only one overwhelmed lady dealing with the needs of over three hundred passengers. It is beyond comprehension how an airline of EasyJet's stature could allow such a woefully understaffed situation to occur. Unfortunately, the frustration did not stop there. Upon reaching the departure gate, I was greeted with the distressing sight of an obviously intoxicated and vulgar man causing a commotion at the bar. It was abundantly clear to anyone with basic judgment that this individual was in no condition to fly. He then proceeded to wander around the terminal, rudely interacting with both staff and passengers, while attempting to light a cigarette. The potential safety risk he posed to everyone on the flight was glaringly evident, and I was utterly shocked to witness the inaction of the EasyJet staff in preventing him from boarding the plane. As time passed, the intoxicated passenger's behavior grew increasingly aggressive towards anyone who dared to approach him. Astonishingly, the gate staff checked him in without any regard for the safety of the other passengers, allowing him to board the plane despite the obvious risk he presented. I was among the last passengers to board, and the atmosphere on the plane was one of fear and discomfort as this individual continued to disrupt and behave aggressively throughout the flight. Only after an excruciating two-hour delay and numerous complaints from concerned passengers did the decision to call the police to remove the intoxicated man from the flight finally come about. This delay was further compounded by the lack of clear communication from your staff. Even the pilot expressed disbelief at how this man was allowed to board the plane in his inebriated state. The incident not only caused unnecessary distress to passengers but also created an unprofessional and unsafe environment that is wholly unacceptable. The apparent indifference of your staff towards the welfare of your customers and their failure to act promptly in such a dangerously evident situation is deeply reprehensible.",,Business,Economy Class,Milan to Gatwick,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Milan,London,,Negative,-0.996,  write express deep disappointment sheer frustration appal service experience recent 20th july 2023 journey ezy8312 milan malpensa london gatwick absolute nightmare outset begin electronic gate milan malpensa airport either order deliberately switch result infuriatingly slow chaotic process quite ordeal witness incompetence ground staff add misery one overwhelm lady deal need three hundred passenger beyond comprehension stature allow woefully understaffed situation occur unfortunately frustration stop upon reach departure gate greet distress sight obviously intoxicated vulgar man cause commotion bar abundantly clear anyone basic judgment individual condition fly proceed wander around terminal rudely interact staff passenger attempt light cigarette potential safety risk pose everyone glaringly evident utterly shock witness inaction staff prevent boarding time pass intoxicated passenger behavior grow increasingly aggressive towards anyone dare approach astonishingly gate staff check without regard safety passenger allow board despite obvious risk present among last passenger board atmosphere one fear discomfort individual continue disrupt behave aggressively throughout excruciate delay numerous complaint concerned passenger decision call police remove intoxicate man finally come delay compound lack clear communication staff pilot express disbelief man allow board inebriate state incident cause unnecessary distress passenger create unprofessional unsafe environment wholly unacceptable apparent indifference staff towards welfare customer failure act promptly dangerously evident situation deeply reprehensible
24,Arunabha Sengupta,Netherlands,2023-07-20,1,"Booked a flight from Amsterdam to London and back. The outbound flight did not take off. When I reached the airport it was delayed by 5 hours and then the board said cancelled. I booked the next flight (a new flight) and went anyway. The return flight was cancelled again (after our being on board for 2 hours) and a replacement flight was arranged on the following day (14 July). I could not afford that delay and took the Eurostar back. I understood that since I did not cancel the return flight I could not get compensated for it. But the onward flight had been a problem with the Airline. I filed for compensation and after 2 days got the message that I was not eligible for it because I did not travel on the flight. A cancelled flight and I was supposed to travel on it. I spent half an hour with an agent with capacity for inefficiency. She took fifteen minutes to grasp what I was looking for.

30,Michael Kelly,United Kingdom,2023-07-02,1,"This airline is a complete shambles! We arrived at the airport, our flight was delayed for 30 mins, We then boarded the plane, when we were all seated the captain mentioned there would be a short delay, due to the tyre needing looked at (which we now know this was just the excuse for not having enough staff for our flight). We sat in the plane for another hour then the captain came back with the real reason why we hadn't moved - we are waiting on new cabin crew coming to the plane and we can't find them! They're in the airport somewhere so please bear with us! Really professional.  After 3 hours of sitting on the plane we were then informed that they have found the cabin crew. Cabin crew entered the plane to applause from everyone, however this little bit of joy was not too last. After 5 hours we taxied getting ready for take off then the plane engines stopped and we were informed that our flight was being cancelled! We were then taken from the plane and led through everyone that were awaiting to board other flights like refugees it was embarrassing, when we got to the Swiss port info desk we were then told that easyjet do not have an information desk at the airport anymore, so there was no easyjet rep to explain anything! We were then led to the luggage retrieval belt to wait on our luggage which took a further 2 hours to come out, whilst waiting I noticed young children crying and elderly people so tired and stressed out lying in corners deflated. We were informed by the easyjet app that our whole holiday had been cancelled and we can apply for a full refund (which I'm still awaiting on) and we could claim for compensation. This is were the plot thickens. We got home after 12 hours of stress the next morning I filled in a claim for compensation only to be told a day later that we our not entitled to any because the plane was grounded due to damage on the tyre! Well if that was the case why leave us on damaged plane for 5 hours? This is easyjets legal loophole to get away without paying out compensation claims. I sincerely hope they go bust because in my opinion this company are just about greed, making as much money as they possibly can without a thought of the stress and anxiety that they put hard working families that have promised their kids a great holiday only to have that dream shattered.

33,Claire Whitaker,United Kingdom,2023-06-25,1,"easyJet left us stranded abroad twice with no money, food, clothing, hotel or way home. They turned off all methods of communication, didn’t answer phone lines and put the phone down on customers. They have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back, which they will then deny. They have cost us thousands and haven’t been in touch with us at all. They’ve even blocked our social media comments.  We were supposed to return to the U.K. on the 23rd from Croatia, and so we headed to the airport for our flight from Split to Manchester. We sat for hours in the airport, and noted delay after delay. During the delays, we received no updates from staff, only learning of delays from the easyJet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water. It’s suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay, but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway. Duty free was incredibly expensive and limited, as were the facilities. We sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication, easyJet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance. The flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement. You were left to rebook the flights through the EJ app; there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available, paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket. The next direct flights weren’t for days, and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across Europe (Amsterdam, Milan, Rome) etc and not only were they with huge layovers, there were not enough seats on any of them, and also experienced the problem of being during the following days. Our smaller group had taken the Croatia to Milan connecting flight option, as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the U.K. earlier. We were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the U.K and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise, rather than days, so we were left with little choice. As there was no contact from easyJet and the staff were unhelpful, we also had to find a hotel at 11:30pm at night and then also find a way to get to it. Due to the timings, we had no food or water, and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us, we had to keep our morning flight to Milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies. We did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed, and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyJet to resolve first, so they cannot and would not help.

The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the ""delay"" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023.

39,Manuela Monacelli,United Kingdom,2023-06-07,1,"If you want to travel to EU from London, I'd suggest you use any other company. I flew to Naples on the 3/06/23. The flight landed in a different airport from what it should have been - we were informed halfway through the flight that we had missed NAP closing time by 6 minutes, and had to land in Milan (800km away) instead. Surely, EasyJet would have checked with Naples airport that we were ok to land at the ETA to authorise departure. I'm sure that, where there's a risk of missing closing time by 6 mins as we were told, the considerate & reasonable thing to do would be to cancel the flight. I have reasons to believe that this was not done so that the incident could be marked as ""exceptional circumstances"", so that EasyJet could get away with not refunding passengers as per its refund policy. So either the staff was so naïve as to not consider that flights can miss closing time by 6 mins, or this was deliberate fraudulent behaviour. Either way, it was unacceptable. EasyJet kept us waiting 5 hours at the airport, before boarding us and only then diverting our plane. We were also promised that EasyJet would provide accommodation and alternative transport, only to find out after 2 hours' wait that no, this would not be provided and we would have to think for ourselves. I was going to Naples to attend a wedding, which I missed. I cannot think of anything that would repay me not only of the financial cost, but also the time waste (the whole trip took me 21 h), and the psychological stress the company has deliberately inflicted on me.

Boarding is simple with 2 queues, one queue for those who pre-booked a large cabin bag, and a second queue for those who only have a small rucksack/handbag. The flight experience is comfortable and predictable, the crew are polite. The food available to purchase is excellent. Bags arrived quickly.

53,G Maneil,United Kingdom,2023-05-01,1,"I am writing to denounce my profound regret regarding my flights with easyJet. Customers try to choose EasyJet because they are low costs but the hidden fees and the staff behaviour made me spend with easyJet really more than other airlines such as Air France or Lufthansa. I think that easyJet has many problems including the fact that a flight can only be changed for an important cost (£49) when it is within two months (who will book and change a flight before two months?). Hence the change would represent twice the price of the flight price. However, I am writing regarding a specific issue. Yesterday, I had two flights with easyJet, the first from Lyon to London Luton and the second from London Luton to Edinburgh. Three days before my flight I bought the right to have a large cabin bag (that cost me £47 for the first flight and £15 for the second one). Everything was OK with the first flight where I had my cabin bag with me in the cabin (where its place should be). However, in London Luton, the staff member at the check-in desk forced me to pay 48 additional pounds for the same cabin bag with a 10.9kg weight (in order to check it in as hold luggage). Please note that the same bag fitted really well on the plane for the first flight (from Lyon to London Luton). Moreover, I observed that other passengers had cabin bags larger than mine. Hence, today I observed that easyJet staff are not coherent in imposing additional fees to customers from one country to another. Also, they are not treating their customers in the same manner. I initially paid around £22 for this flight. In the end, it cost me £85: £22 (initial payment) + £15 (Large cabin bag ) + £48 (when they forced me to check in the large cabin bag that was supposed to come with me in the cabin) In addition to this, you can read on the news every day about the high rate of delays and cancellations of this airline. Don't underestimate the stress that can be caused by this airline. Also, it has plenty of other low costs around that do not have such bad reviews from customers. So, I would advise anyone to avoid this airline.",,Business,Economy Class,Luton to Edinburgh,April 2023,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Luton,Edinburgh,,Negative,-0.9314,  write denounce profound regret regard flight customer try choose low cost hide fee staff behaviour make spend really air france lufthansa think many problem include fact change important cost within two month book change two month hence change represent twice price price however write regard specific issue yesterday two flight first lyon london luton second london luton edinburgh three day buy right large cabin bag cost first second one everything ok first cabin bag cabin place however london luton staff member desk force pay 48 additional pound cabin bag weight order check hold luggage please note bag fit really well first lyon london luton moreover observe passenger cabin bag large mine hence today observe staff coherent impose additional fee customer one country another treat customer manner initially pay around end cost initial payment large cabin bag force check large cabin bag suppose come cabin addition read news every day high rate delay cancellation underestimate stress cause plenty low cost around bad review customer advise anyone avoid

73,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2023-01-25,10,"It's several years since we have flown with any other airline but easyJet, which I think speaks for itself. We have in the past used Ryanair occasionally but once they started seating couples separately if they did not pay for seats we ceased to do so. EasyJet suits us perfectly and flies to the places we want to visit. We were apprehensive when the rules / charges relating to baggage taken on board were changed, but we experimented flying with backpacks only which will fit under the seats in front and found that we could easily manage with those for a week's holiday. Since then we have happily travelled lightly and found it very easy indeed. We actually registered the fact on our most recent trip that is the ""Speedy Boarding"" passengers who now rush to queue when the boarding staff appear because they want to make sure of finding locker space as close to their seats as possible. The rest of us who have not paid extra for anything can just wait and board at our leisure. I can't recall more than one major delay in all the years we have used easyJet and just a few minor ones. On our last trip earlier this month both the outward and inward flights left and arrived slightly early. Flying out from Liverpool as we invariably do, we find it very rare that there is any nitpicking about bag sizes (despite some of the bags that we sometimes see!) and the whole process of flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed. It obviously helps that we know the ropes and that we keep abreast of any rule changes e.g. regarding baggage. It does seem to me that some of the critics fail to check on things like this and therefore are at least partly to blame when faced with charges they did not expect.",Airbus 320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Liverpool to Palma de Mallorca,January 2023,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,,5,yes,False,Liverpool,Palma de Mallorca,,Positive,0.9517,  several year since fly think speaks past use ryanair occasionally start seat couple separately pay seat cease suit us perfectly fly place want visit apprehensive rule charge relate baggage take board change experiment fly backpack fit seat front find easily manage week holiday since happily travel lightly find easy indeed actually register fact recent trip speedy board passenger rush queue boarding staff appear want make sure find locker space close seat possible rest us pay extra anything wait board leisure ca recall one major delay year use minor one last trip earlier month outward inward flight leave arrived slightly early fly liverpool invariably find rare nitpick bag size despite bag sometimes see whole process fly us relatively relax obviously help know rope keep abreast rule change regard baggage seem critic fail check thing like therefore least partly blame faced charge expect

I tried to add a selected seat today Nov 26th for one of the passengers, which included an extra large cabin bag and other different perks. Unfortunately, their system when you tried to get one of those selected seats, it does not allow you to continue with the process without buying obligatory another seat for the other passenger even I do not need it. So I decided to contact them by chat to see if they can get me a solution. After expending 30 minutes chatting with the customer service agent, he told me that he can provide me with this service but £5 more expensive than the website price. I asked him, why, and he mentioned that doing it through the website is cheaper. The situation was ridiculous, even though I spent precious time chatting with him, EasyJet wants to charge me more because of their badly designed system. I wished I could do it by the website without expending more time. So I recommend to people to even booked passenger tickets separately and you can manage the options individually or book flight tickets with another company which has a better system, EasyJet tries to get as much money as they can from their loyal customers. But never more, even I was one of the people affected by their famous data breach and never claim anything because I have been using Easy Jet for a long time and always I had good service.

The travel day began with the initial flight and then Easy Jet reservations were made to fly hours later to Lisbon Portugal. We landed on time at CDG airport and received notification from Easy Jet that our flight to Lisbon was delayed for 90 minutes. No issue there for us - just a bit more time to stretch our legs. The communication from Easy Jet came in a text. I still have a picture of the text received. We arrived at the gate prior to the original departure time to find that the flight was only 11 minutes late and because we were not at the gate two hours prior to the original departure time we were not allowed to board the airplane. The gate agent would lend absolutely no support. We were not the only passengers that were left that day. We each purchased our ticket and a carry on bag for the flight. There were no other flights from CDG airport available to Lisbon that day which was not an option for us as we had to meet our tour group. We each had to make reservations for TAP Portugal out of Orly Airport - about an hour Uber Drive from CDG.

So we didn't care to dig into the airline assuming it is the standard stuff. But boy we were wrong, we took a Friday flight 30th of September EZY885, was supposed to take of 18:05, but only took off around 18:45 or something like that, thankfully, we had nothing planned. Then on the way back on the 3rd of October Ezy6414 @ 9:15, they decided my standard bag was too big for the cabin, because apparently on Feb2021, they shrunk the seats and the cabin size even more, and charged me £24 for it. That bag was half empty, I could have brought a smaller one had I known. Why are they going against standardisation? They actively want to catch you, the lady there could have let it go, it's not like that money goes to her pocket, but some people enjoy letting others down. They must hate their jobs immensely (customer service is difficult, especially with money grabbing management that are paid 6digits compared to people in her level with 1.65bn revenue).

108,G Bardero,Portugal,2022-09-18,1,"At first, the ground crew manager came up to the passengers asking for volunteers to change to another flight (they would fly to Santiago de Compostela instead, and have a bus waiting for them to take them to Porto, and all they offered was a 500€ compensation, which is much less than what they should actually have to pay every passenger if no one took the offer and they had to refuse entry to passengers) as they mismanaged and overbooked this flight (even though they kept insisting on that it was an aircraft issue and they had to use a smaller one, while the people at the check in desks said clearly that it was overbooked). After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a ""Oh sorry sir"", then the attendant moved on like nothing happened.

113,Max Hoffmann,Germany,2022-08-31,1,"I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen).  When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled ""hands off"" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit möchte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gepäckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgebühr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zurückfordern. Das ganze spielte sich den 17.08.22 um ca. 18:20 am Gate A38 des Flughafen BER ab, an welchem ich mit meiner Reisebegleitung bereits um 17:35 auf den Flug EJU5539 nach Paris Orly hätte boarden sollen. Der Flug war also schon verspätet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gepäckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgepäckstück sei zu groß. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste. Auf der Gepäckmessanlage passte er von Höhe und Breite dementsprechend auch perfekt rein. Lediglich die Dicke überschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gepäckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu spät, ich muss zahlen oder das Gepäck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal über die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andrücken exakt die Maße eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine Hände und schrie ,,Hände weg"" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben müsse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine Möglichkeit dagegen vorzugehen.

They can get away with this by grossly exaggerating arrival time. I wondered why they were saying this short hop took so long, now I know. They are dishonest and bordering on corrupt. We had a horrific time at Gatwick, met with disdain by the most unprofessional person I've ever met. Told to rebook missed flight for 2 days later and pay transfer of £120. No assistance offered and absolutely no sympathy. Stayed in a hotel and flew with TUI the next day. They were wonderful in comparison. We all need to write to the transport secretary instead of Easyjet because they couldn't care less what customers are saying. They keep issuing lies about helping customers as much as they can but this is more corrupt nonsense.

I asked to speak to the duty manager, who eventually came over to see me, they explained that we were expected to manage our own booking via the app, after explaining out circumstances and the reasons we were due to travel they agreed to transfer us onto another easyJet flight to Antalya later on that day at 1520, and that we would have to pay for the onward 6 hour road transport to take us to our original location in Bodrum, to keep the receipt and claim the money back as there policy states they are only able to book road transport within the UK and not overseas. We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol. When we boarded our new flight to Antalya we were advised by the cabin crew that the operating aircraft had not been restocked therefore no duty free was available and they had very limited food and drink to sell onboard.

158,S Hee,France,2022-03-08,1,"First time I come across a budget airline that only includes a small backpack as a base. Even the small cabin suitcase allowance is an add on. So we were forced to upgrade to “upfront seats” (+25€ per person) to have a cabin suitcase. This option also includes a priority check in with the EasyJet Plus queue to skip the normal long single queue for check in (see screenshot of easyJet email). We arrived in the Lisbon airport terminal 2 more than 2 hours in advance though we knew that we could have priority check in at EasyJet plus. When we waited for a while and finally arrived at the counter 203, the woman there was very rude and told us they do not have priority boarding today and that she doesn’t know anything about it. We insisted with the proof from our email we can skip the long queue at the check in counters. She didn’t even bother to look at what was written in that easyJet email nor give any explanation to why this service was removed “today”. She said the priority boarding is only for people who require special assistance. She was like “oh your flight is to Paris, you’ve got plenty of time” in a nonchalant manner. And she just spoke directly to the clients in the long queue, “next one”, waving us away.  No apologies, no emails from easyJet communicating this before we arrive at the airport and nothing was written before people started queuing. We paid an extra 50 euros for this extra convenience but they did not honour their contract and completely ignored us at the EasyJet plus counter. We spoke to the service centre (Portway) for the airline at the airport but the woman there also refused to help. Said she can’t do anything about it. So we waited almost 1.5 hours in the normal queue. After we got our boarding passes, I met a lady in front of us had the same case as what we endured, but worse. She was refused on the EasyJet plus priority check in queue and then refused her boarding because she was “late”. So she missed her flight. Both of us arrived more than 2 hours before the flight time (the check in counter only opens 2 hours before the flight time). But I had to run to the gates in order not to miss my flight.

164,Marta Bartoszewicz,United Kingdom,2022-01-09,1,"Together with my husband and five-year-old son, we arrived at the airport in advance due to the purchased additional luggage (23kg) We were one of the first to check-in because many people who flew to Berlin at that time had a problem with checking in at the airport by Easy Jet at a time when other airlines (e.g. Ryanair) did not have these problems. Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way. We asked the staff for help in changing tickets to another flight, but we were refused help, suggesting that we could contact customer service ourselves on the number that we can find on the Internet.

When I arrived at the gate for the second flight I realized I left my purse at security. The two gate agents would not call security and they would not give me the number for security. Hence I missed another flight at this point it became a comedy show due to the incompetence of EasyJet personnel, this was from the manager to a supervisor to customer service people who are clueless. Long story short me along with another couple who missed the flight because they were held in security needed to buy another ticket. This cost 110 pounds because they failed to inform us that if you don’t buy the ticket with more than two hours prior to the flight you have to pay their exorbitant fee of 110 versus 85.

194,Darrel Relf,United Kingdom,2021-08-26,1,"On Friday 13th August at roughly 20.00hrs our flight from Gibraltar to Gatwick was cancelled due to fog. After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay. The food and drinks receipts we submitted were not itemised so they will not pay. The accommodation receipt did not have a date stamp on it (even though it was dated the 14th August the day after we should have gone home) so they will not pay. Easyjet flight cancellation actually cost us £289.00 and they have agreed to reimburse us £20!

Only a small wheel got past the metal box, as deserted as the plane was and given the situation they could have clearly arranged a place for my baggage.

I am filled with so much rage ,anger and even sadness. The way she spoke like I was some insignificant number, just another dumb client enraged me to the depths of my soul.

When we first got to the airport in Athens and went through check-in, it was fast, efficient and the staff were friendly. Airport procedures were smooth and hassle free. The boarding area was quite busy and few shops and cafès were open. We ended up waiting about an hour when we got to the gate because getting through the airport was more efficient than  expected. The plane was clean but not spotless. The toilets stank a bit and there was a bit of mess in places but nothing to make a big deal about.

I was stuck with the breakfast box, which wasn't fantastic but wasn't bad. Service was OK.

In January we booked our flights to the UK with British Airways and we booked a flight from Glasgow to Belfast with easyJet.

Since the cancellation of our British Airways flights, I have trying to get in contact with easyJet, to let them know, that there is no conceivable way we can get to Glasgow by the 21st August. All attempts to contact easyJet have been unsuccessful. After two hours of being on line with their customer care line listening to the stupid ring tone, I realised no one was on the other line. I tried their facebook, twitter and email accounts, but could get no response at all. Earlier this year, the easyJet website clearly stated that change fees will be waived due to the pandemic, as long as the changes occur 14 days prior to the scheduled flight. When trying to change the flights tonight (14 days prior to the scheduled flight), however I was charged 228 GBP for the change fee. Please keep in mind that the original flight cost was only 192 GBP. I find this unacceptable.

274,M Manakov,United Kingdom,2020-02-12,3,"My friend and I travelled on 07 Feb 2020 from Gatwick to Marseille. Our flight was over 5 hours delayed due to an air traffic control strike which we were informed about whilst on the plane already 2 hours delayed. We were originally booked on British Airways and they cancelled the night before, which means EasyJet would have known about the strike at the same time and failed to act accordingly (notify us or tell us there would be a delay). We were kept outside in the cold waiting to board for 30 minutes before the plane was ready, then we were kept on the plane for 4 hours without any refreshments and not letting us disembark to stretch our legs. Then we were let off the plane into the gate to buy some food, which we had to pay for ourselves and not given any vouchers. Finally, we were let back onto the plane and took off almost 6 hours after the originally scheduled take-off time. They then provided us each with a soft drink and bag of crisps - hardly something sustainable for a delay of over 6 hours. The pilot told us that they should not have treated us like this and urged us all to file a complaint and ask for compensation due to the fact that the airline failed to inform us of the strike prior to boarding/delays. The crew told us that we could not get off and refuse to take the flight if we wanted to receive compensation so we felt stuck in this regard. I filed a EC261 Compensation Claim and was rejected within less than 24 hours due to the fact that it was an ""extraordinary circumstance"" due to the air traffic control strike.

281,D Murten,United Kingdom,2020-01-20,1,"Luton to Zurich. On arrival at the gate I found there was a long queue into the ‘room’ where final boarding card and passport checks are carried out. Passengers were queueing out of the room and up two flight of stairs. There were signs for ‘speedy boarding’ but these were utterly pointless due to the overcrowding in the stairwell - the only staff on hand (who should have been marshalling this situation) were staff telling people that their hand luggage would have to go in the hold as the overhead lockers would be too full - fortunately this didn’t affect me as the staff started this process well behind me at the back of the queue, which then started moving. On arrival into the room and managed to fight my way through to the speedy boarding lane - I was naturally the last person in this queue. When we boarded the aircraft I then found that there was no space in the overhead lockers anywhere near my seat (1B), mostly because they were full of hats, coats, handbags, scarves and other items which, if the cabin staff had any sense and were in any way proactive about the situation, could have been put under the seat in front. At the insistence of the particularly unhelpful male cabin crew member, I had to place my hand luggage, for which I had paid extra, in the overhead lockers about 10 rows back on one side and the other item about 13 rows back on the other. I asked him if he would be retrieving them for me on departure to which he replied ‘no, I won’t be getting them’ - I already knew the answer and I knew equally well that this would mean that I would either have to fight my way upstream to retrieve them on landing, or wait for the entire aircraft to empty before going back to get them, which is the option I took which meant that I was the last passenger to leave the aircraft...from seat 1B - absolutely ridiculous.

When we arrived the airline Baggage attendant Informed us we had to pay $52 per person for baggage. I informed her I had already paid for baggage in which she stated she did not see it and we had to pay for it again in order to place our bags on the aircraft. We purchased bags, received our boarding passes and then were told after our flight was delayed two hours. I explained to her we have a connecting flight and we will not make it on time because of the flight being delayed. She told me that it wasn’t her problem because it was a different airline.I went to the customer service desk and she stated there is nothing she can do. My boyfriend and I politely asked for our luggage back in which the staff stated she can’t refund us our money back for the baggage. We had to purchase two more flights to get home.

287,H Xi,Australia,2020-01-05,1,"I had a poor experience today flying from Zurich to London this morning at 9:30 local time. I have also flown a few times with a small backpack (to put under my feet) and a carry on luggage no problem with other airlines. The counter staff seemed unsympathetic at all and was pressuring me to just pay the CHF 76 and move along, standing in front of me just saying that it was impossible that all the stuff would fit (when I was trying to put the stuff from the small bag to the larger one.) She even went as far as to suggest to me and another family that we won't be allowed to test the luggage dimensions again and just to pay the 76 francs. (That's nearly as much as the ticket itself!) Even, when I did manage to fit the small suitcase into the slot, she said that it had to be smooth fit and that it couldn't be squeezed in. I have never expected such strictness and unreasonable behaviour from airport staff before and I can only believe it was out of spite that she said this as she realised that I had actually been able to fit the backpack into the carry on suitcase. I even saw her pressure the other family to pay just because they had an iPad that was not in the carry-on. When I got on, there was more than enough space in the overhead lockers and I had intended to put my backpack under my feet in any case to save space. In the end, I was forced by the same staff member to throw out my slippers as again she claimed they were an additional item of luggage. Seriously? All it did for easyJet, in the end, was that there was no way I would pay such a money-grabbing 76 francs and it didn't solve their issue of overcrowded luggage as the now larger suitcase was taking up more space in the overhead compartment than if I had 2 separate ones, 1 above and the small backpack underneath my feet. All in all, I believe this to be an extremely frustrating experience for both myself and easyJet as a company which could have been much better handled with more reasonable and less spiteful staff members who could have been more professional with the way they handled customers.

288,H Grentey,United Kingdom,2020-01-04,10,"London to Rome. Many of the poor reviews seem to relate to baggage issues. We followed the website protocol and booked 3 bags into the hold. We were well below the (combined) baggage allowance but preferred to play it safe rather than have hassle at the airport. Equally, none of us had wheelie suitcases but the kids and my husband had little rucksacks while I took a bag that fitted into the under-seat dimensions. As a result, we had no issues at the gate. On the return flight, they were asking everyone at the back of line, where we were, with wheeled luggage to check it into the hold but they looked at our bags and said 'that's fine'. I think that you just need to follow the rules with easyJet if you want a pleasant experience. Other than that, the flights themselves were great. Friendly pilots, very friendly cabin crew and an efficient service. We had onboard snacks and drinks and they were all very good. I don't think they were overly expensive but another time, we might take our own snacks to save a bit.

When we went inside the aircraft the crew opened the front door and the others passengers from the front no longer let us pass. Indeed they were annoyed and angry with us because we blocked the aisle. A lady complained about that - she had seat row 1 - with the two assisting cabin crew but the two ladies ignored her. When we finally reached our seat, there was no longer space in the overhead for our suitcases. The two ladies assisting cabin crew ignored us again. When all passengers was seated and ready to go,  the captain announced a delay of 1 hour and 30 minutes and we had to wait inside the plane. The two cabin crew chatting all the time to each other and they ignored everything around them. They didn't do nothing about four-year-old girl screaming, crying during  the journey from Venice to London, included the 1 hour and half delay. When I left the plane I had a severe headache.

Whilst waiting for the coffees, an announcement then came over the speaker stating “Final Call for EasyJet flight to Belfast at Gate 3” My wife and I then had to abandon the coffees and run to the gate. This was very frustrating as we had paid for a service which we would then not receive. Secondly and most importantly, my wife is currently suffering from a severe hip injury which she is in the process of receiving treatment. Therefore having to run was a great deal of discomfort! When we arrived at the Gate, there was still a huge Que awaiting boarding onto the flight and it was very clear the “Final Call” announcement was incorrect. I  spoke to the EasyJet staff at the boarding desk and informed them of the  situation. I asked if it was possible for I to walk back to the Starbucks to retrieve the coffees but they said it was not feasible and I would miss the flight. The EasyJet staff were not at all helpful or understanding. They showed zero sign of empathy.

295,A Lantisya,United Kingdom,2019-12-25,1,"Luton to Seville. I paid for extra luggage to pack my bulky equipment. At Seville Airport it turned out that I was the only passenger whose luggage was lost. All my sports holiday plans were ruined on the first day. I was able to adjust them for the short-term but they managed to ruin it twice. At the airport (I arrived at ~11am), I was assured that necessary forms were filled in and I should receive all further communication by email. I’ve waited for some time - got nothing. Had to go online and manually fill in all the forms again; only after that I’ve got the first email saying “We’ll send you regular updates via SMS and email”. Since that email I have received no info by emaill/SMS in two days and had to call a few times a day to get some info, and every single time repeating all my details. Until 8pm I was not even sure if my luggage was located. Finally they’ve found it at Luton airport. No info by email/sms. Someone at the call center told me that the bag is scheduled for a flight on Day 3 and should be in Seville at 11am. Day 3: I’ve called easyjet early morning to figure out if the bag will be delivered today. Throughout the day, three people at easyjet provided me with certainty that the bag will be delivered today to my hotel in the afternoon, “certainly today”. I was a fool to trust them again one can judge. If they could only inform me that they cant guarantee a certain day of delivery - I would have come to the airport myself and collected my stuff, without which I was stuck in a Spanish village with almost nothing to do as all my holidays were dependent on my sports equipment. Easyjet turned out to be  liars as the luggage has not arrived that day. Also, only after my complaint about no communication - they did send another update, after more than 48 hours. Day 4 At 8am I reached the call renter again and a person there told me completely different info, that they have handed my bag over to the delivery center and can’t guarantee time of delivery. Why on Earth have not his colleagues told me the same info the day before?! All of them were assuring me to expect the bag in the hotel on Day 3. I was redirected to the local airport for more information. I’ve been trying to call them for 3 hours (was even wondering if this was a holiday in Spain?). Only at 11am someone picked up and told me that I should not call every day to them, and they already handed over my bag to the delivery company and no longer have info on that. I asked them to provide me with the phone number of the delivery company so I can track my bag and they were not able to provide it. I felt completely lost, miserable and helpless to be honest. At 2pm I received email which stated that the bag was delivered - it was NOT. I felt they were kidding me. Called them again - they have informed that the bag should be with me at 5pm. It actually arrived at 9pm. To sum up, that is the most awful customer experience I have ever faced.

I was assisted at every step throughout the airport process - from check-in, through security, up to the gate and finally on to the aircraft. On arrival in Kraków I was met by the Welcome team who not only helped me off the aircraft, into the terminal and through immigration, but escorted me to the railway station and put me on a train to the city centre. The whole process was replicated on the return journey. We often read criticism of easyJet and their ilk but I really think that people very often only write about their bad experiences. So I just want to balance the scales a little and present a ‘good news’ story. I had a wonderful time in Kraków, helped in no small part by easyJet and their partners.

307,Serra Iyi,United Kingdom,2019-11-26,4,"Bristol to Geneva. I came across the rudest, least empathetic airline employee today. After letting other women with totes and carry ons walk by she picked me out and asked me to open my carry on, put my tote in it, close it and fit it into the carry on size check boxes. My carry on is sold under description it  says allowed on EasyJet flights. When i did what she asked me to do my suitcase fit but i couldnt bend and lift the carry on again. When I asked for help she said she would come but made me wait until almost everyone had boarded. I asked her why she was being so mean to me while letting everyone else walk by with same or more luggage. No response. Instead of helping me she walked back to the line and boarded more passengers. At the end it was a kind young female passenger that helped me lift the carry on out of the size checking bars. She also commented on the employee's rudeness.  Because I was late in boarding despite having paid extra for a front row seat, my carry on ended up being stored 20 rows behind me. It will be fun finding it after landing. It is not that she asked me to check what is a standard rule at EasyJet but that she did not ask other with same or more weight to do the same so I was arbitrarily picked by her. I wish I had other choices when flying out of Bristol but Easyjet is my only option. I would really appreciate the company providing some common sense and empathy training to their customer-facing employees and ensuring that their rules are standard for all passengers, not just those an employee arbitrarily selects.

327,A Davis,United Kingdom,2019-10-16,1,"London Stansted to Naples. I was very disappointed by one of the crew members of my Easyjet flight to Naples on 13th of October 2019 (flight n. EZY325). I’ve been told, rudely, that there was no more space for my small luggage and had to drop it. I gently explained that I needed the luggage with me because every minute was on the count as I was flying for a home emergency and couldn’t waste time at the airport once in Naples. She kept saying “there’s no space sir”. Then I raised, saying “My dad is dying, and I can’t wait for my luggage. Please just let me keep this with me.” She said “No, there’s no space. Just doing my job.” I’m not here to contest her arrogance, but there was not even a small track of empathy with my request. Like trying to understand the situation and at least try to find a little solution. Even because I’ve seen other people after me with some big bags or small luggage coming to the cabin. So I don’t understand the fact that was no space left. I found this very upsetting and disrespectful. This shows a completely poor attitude and a huge lack of moral and lack of professionality and lack of passion from the crew member. She might have had a tough day, maybe she was already on her second/third flight on her shift, but still: you get paid for it. It’s your job, not mine. And this is not an isolated case for Easyjet cabin crew, or in general low-cost companies. And I arrived at the conclusion that it’s sad to see tired members of staff not being focused on the customer needs but just on the Company business sides’ how to make more money “squeezing” us like limes.

Also the person checking my suitcase didn't show any sort of emotions: I am used to customer oriented airlines where the staff cares about their customers, this is not the case for easyjet.

The explanation of the delay was due to weather conditions in the city of departure (Barcelona). In fact, it was raining in the morning by afternoon it was slightly cloudy and other planes were departing on time from Barcelona. I was trying to contact the airlines by phone but it was not helpful at all. No response. Online chat button did not work and moreover, it is only available till 8 pm. During the waiting time, a representative of the air company offered the passengers a voucher for only 4 euros (a meal is much more expensive in the airport). Furthermore, the information about the vouchers was on their website an hour before they really started distributing them. The most important that I was not able to be on time at a railway station in Paris because I needed to go by train to another city in France. Being a student and having a limited budget I lost the money spent on my train ticket. The captain was very weird saying that our flight would last 1h and 35 minutes but then he said he would expect in Paris by midnight (considering the new departure time of 21:35).

Instead she rather just ran off a standard speech that the flight is not delayed and that I needed to go and find my wife.

Two days before our flight we went to check in online, My mother in law and father in law had no problems, but when we were checking in at the same time we were unable to check in. We contacted easy jet to be told they had over booked our seats. The only option they gave us was to turn up at 4am of the morning of the flight and see if people didn’t show up, they may arrange another plane but that wasn’t a guarantee either. We felt our only realistic option was to book another flight for my husband and I as the likely hood of people not turning up for a flight in the school holidays was unlikely and likewise with easy jet putting on another plane. We spoke to easy jet about this and had to pay again! So we paid £275 each return originally and then the new flight out because they over booked and wouldn’t guarantee anything cost £150 each. To say I am disgusted with the airline is an understatement. To not exchange our outbound flight for free as they over booked our seats that we paid for months before is beyond as is leaving clients with very little alternatives than to either cancel the holiday or re book flights.

I never received a text message or an email warning me of the delay. Shouldn't I receive it?

We looked for someone from easyJet to ask for help but at that time the airport was deserted. Having no other choice we took the taxi that took us to our accommodation where the next day we had another wedding (always work). The taxi cost us 120 euros. I sent the request for reimbursement of at least the taxi since no one will repay us for all the inconveniences attached to this delay ... but at least the out-of-pocket expenses. I respond that repayment is not possible. It seems absurd to me. The airline no. Does he reimburse the only means of transport available at that time at Cagliari airport?

In all, it was a similar experience to any other airline. However, it was a completely different story when it came to bags. We could only check one bag per couple. We managed to transfer items between bags to make it work. We then had to leave one overhead-sized carry on to be stored below. That was what we wanted to begin with, but we had to drag it through a busy airport first. The big issue for us is that some people were charged for stowing that extra bag (€60) when others were not. This was after they were told to take those bags to the gate. It was very confusing and it appeared that there was no set standard. The whole boarding process was slow, confusing, and stressful.

358,B Reiner,United States,2019-09-02,1,"Stockholm to Berlin Tegel. Worst cheapo airline ever! The way these people treat passengers is absolutely ridiculous. Everyone was lined up for boarding, and it took forever because at the gate they complained about every little thing that didn't fit their interpretation of the carry-on policy. Every 2nd person was pulled aside for bag size/weight checks or to put stuff into their 1 bag they're allowed to bring on board. They wouldn't even let people hold a book or a jacket in their hands. ""Only 1 item allowed!"" they kept telling everyone, even though the policy says 1 bag, not 1 item. A book or a jacket is not a bag! My bag was a little bigger than what they allow, and I was fine with paying extra. However after doing so the check-in employee instructed me to ""leave the bag at somewhere at the gate before entering the plane"". I walk down the gate, had to go to the rear door walking across the air field .. no sign, no attendee about dropping checked bags. I enter the plane, the bag fits perfectly in the overhead bin, I sit down, we take off, we land and I exit the plane with my carry-on. Where was I supposed to leave my bag? Somewhere unattended in the gate? Anyone who's ever flown knows: ""Never leave your bags unattended"". Anyone walking by could've accessed my stuff. Sorry EasyJet, but this was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable! I've disputed the credit card charge through my bank, because I'm not paying for a checked bag that I didn't have.

360,Peter Gorman,United Kingdom,2019-09-02,3,"Gatwick to Belfast. As a very regular flyer particularly with this airline I believe my opinions are fair and well grounded. Taking at least two flights a week every week, this airline has become very unreliable in 2019. Constant delays of evening flights being announced before 10am the same day. This Friday I faced yet another 3 hour delay, I hear all those saying claim, but this doesn't return the time lost and away from my family. What it does do though is add an expensive £50 taxi fare with other transport options closed at 2am. So, the moral of my story is, with a very delayed Friday the night prior I contacted easyJets plus and flight club that I have membership of hoping that I might be permitted to move my 9pm Sunday flight to an earlier option. I advised of the issues, very politely I add, the day before asking simply to take the plane 50mins earlier. Sure £100 plus was the reply, so this is from an airline that has over £5k of my money in flights booked through to march 2020, zero empathy, zero flexibility advising turn up early and take your chances like everyone else. So flight club and plus membership, let alone loyalty stands for absolutely nothing. Never once have I submitted an eu261 claim for the countless late arrivals and multiple taxi fares.

We also wonder why it is that the departure gate at Luton is always so far away from the terminal building. This time we had to walk to the farthest of 16 gates while only one of the other gates along the way was in use. The speedy boarding option offered by easyJet is worth the price as it avoids long queues. It is also possible to book seats with extra legroom, providing all passengers are over 16. Of course, the price adds up and if you pay for hold baggage as well it can cost as much as a regular (not cut-price) airline. For us, the convenience of flying from Luton makes this worthwhile.

381,Sacha Guittet,Netherlands,2019-08-01,1,"Amsterdam to Basel. I missed the drop off in Schiphol by 2 minutes. The personnel there refused to re-open the drop off despite the fact that I had my boarding pass and hold luggage pre-paid as the process to re-open was “too complicated “ and was unable to provide any solution to me. As a consequence, I had to buy a last minute ticket with another airline (a regular one) at full price with no compensation. I am amazed by the total lack of service and could understand their behaviour if they would pay a full refund for any delay, even a 2 minutes one.

383,Kelsey Bateson,United Kingdom,2019-07-29,1,"I had a flight to Amsterdam on the 24th of July for mine and my partners first holiday without our families. It was a disaster. I’ve never flown with easyJet before so was apprehensive anyway but was worse than anticipated. We arrived for our flight, been through security checks, all the normal procedures and then proceeded to wait around for 4/5 hours for our flight - our flight was announced cancelled. We went to the information desk and asked what to do next and we’re pointed out of the waiting lounge to the EasyJet desk. We stood in a queue of about 200 people, all upset, and waited a good 30 minutes before being told how to rebook flights. There were only two members of EasyJet staff tending to the 200+ passengers with cancelled flights, one employee on the customer service desk and one handing out leaflets. We managed to get a free hotel for the night with a dinner and breakfast and rebooked a flight for the next day. Theyhotel was mediocre, the food was awful!  The next day we arrived for our flight, again 4/5 hours to spare. We got through security checks etc, and as soon as we got through to the waiting area our flight was delayed by an hour. It was then delayed further, and then delayed again and again. We waited for an extra couple hours and to our surprise we were given a gate to go to! We rushed to the gate, waited there for about 20 minutes, we were then told we had to wait for our flight to land and passengers to get off. We proceeded to wait. We watched the plane land, the passengers get off, bags being unloaded. Flights were taking off all around us. After watching all of this, everyone was getting agitated. Many people were surrounding the gate desk, asking what was happening. No one was getting a straight answer. Later we were told our flight was yet again cancelled for the second time. We then had to wait again for buses back to the baggage area. We made it back to the EasyJet desk with a queue of about 100+ people, all angry and upset. We waited for an additional 20 minutes before someone come out to speak to the passengers. One man at the front of the queue was very angry and started to raise his voice so the manager and employees walked away, back to the staff room I presume, and refused to speak to anyone because of one angry passenger raising his voice. We were left waiting in a queue with lots of agitated passengers so me and my partner left. If there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s to never use easyJet again.

It is how they handled us post problem that was not acceptable and I would describe as horrible... and possibly negligent. I was left stranded in Zurich near midnight (not familiar at all with Zurich) and told to figure out how I would get to my destination on my own. Here is the text from them: We're sorry that your flight has diverted to Zurich airport. This is due to the closure of Basel airport. The disruption is beyond our control and is considered an extraordinary circumstance. We're very sorry but due to high demand in Zurich we are unable to arrange onward transport for you. If you’re able to make your own arrangements, we will refund the cost. Please retain all your receipts in order to make your claim. If you need any further assistance please speak to one of our ground crew in the airport who will be happy to help you. Note ""if you are able to make your own arrangements"" and ""one of our ground crew in the airport... will be happy to help you"" I found one of the ground crew and kindly asked them for help. They told me ""go catch a train"" (I remained very polite since I know it isn't their fault). I asked them where the train station was and if they could help me figure out which train .. they stated just walk straight and turn left you will see a train station (that is all they would say or do, I was left in shock) They offered no other assistance. I found the airport train station and because it was late at night no one was working there. I had to go to the automatic ticket machines. After struggling for 15 minutes I found out that to get to Basel I would have to take two trains and one bus, all of this in the middle of the night in a place I am unfamiliar with. Why couldn't they have at least given us a map and a guide to which trains we would need to take? This could have been very easy for them to print out and offer. When I arrived at Basel (after 2:00 am) I was informed that a KLM flight who was in the same predicament as my easyJet flight - diverted to Zurich., told their passengers to wait and when the storm moved past... flew them on to Basel. I would avoid this airline at all costs, they don't really care if you make it to your destination nor do they care about your  safety.

One of the cabin crew asked the senior crew member to stop the safety brief. He then shouted aggressively to half of the cabin (the area in which I was sat) and basically had a go at us all. He had a very angry look on his face and said we have enough time to talk later. A lot of passengers made comments to each other, including the two passengers sat next to me, at how we had been spoken to. Now I fully understand that the safety briefing is extremely important and from time to time the cabin crew have to be firm with passengers to get their attention, but there is a difference between being firm with customers and being angry/aggressive. After takeoff, most of the passengers sat quietly for the duration of the flight to Amsterdam as they felt like they had been “told off”.

As mentioned in the airport review, check in was excellent due to having HandsFree so able to use priority check in desks. This then allowed me to board at anytime during my leisure after Speedy Boarding, which I took advantage of as boarding looked a slow process. Aircraft was spotless inside and Edinburgh based crew were friendly and welcoming to everyone. Comfortable window seat, decent leg room as I’m 6”1, didn’t feel claustrophobic on this full A320. Much better than the A319 on the Glasgow-Schönefeld outbound on the Thursday where I felt squashed in the window seat. Even though the boarding looked slow at the terminal side, this was completed quickly and soon we were on our way. Service was quick to commence and a reasonable selection of products available onboard. I had prepaid for a bistro voucher so took advantage of the hot meal deal which todays hot selection was the Ham and Cheese Croissant. Hot all the way through, and sufficient for an early evening snack along with a chocolate bar and Earl Grey Tea. Also had a few G&T’s which was perfectly reasonable in terms of price, €14 Remember, these are served as double measures. About 3/4 of the way through the flight I went to pour my last gin when realised that during the trash run, I gave them the full bottle of gin rather than the empty one! So while heading to the back to the toilet, I had a laugh with the crew mentioning what I had done. To my surprise, one of the crew opened the recycling bag and had a quick check to see if the full bottle was amongst the trash. I did not expect that, and we had a laugh about it. No luck, which I assumed. During decent, the cabin manager was making her was from the back, stopped at my row and handed me over a g&t, they had found the full bottle, yet it was too dirty to hand back, so gave me a fresh one. That was well above what I expected!

After my plane being pushed back from 9:10pm to 11pm and finally being able to start the boarding, an Easyjet employee came to me and asked me if I am an EasyJet Plus or Speed Boarding customer to whom I answered that I am not. She then continued and claimed that I had to pay £40 in order to get my cabin luggage into the plane because I was carrying a tiny bag (20cm x 20cm) that I was planning to keep between my legs. I told her that I know that the overhead lockers are limited in terms of space, so I would keep the other bags on my knees or under the passenger seat in order to allow other passengers to put heavier luggage in the lockers. I also explained that I asked multiple times to EasyJet crew about this kind of bags and they were perfectly fine with me taking it in the plane as it is not really a cabin suitcase, so she was the first one to ever ask me to pay for it. She kept saying ""Sorry This is the policy, you have to pay £40 for your luggage!  not showing any sign of compassion or understanding. I explained that with a plane 1h and 50 minutes behind schedule, there was no way I was going to pay an extra £40 for my 20cmx20cm bag on a ticket that was already not worth it considering the delay.

Flight arrived late, late announcement of gate at 1.35 but boarding same kept same 1.40, announced that gate closing, gave 5 minutes to come a long distance to gate 112, arrived gate at 1.50, boarding wasn’t started and plane just arrived. - Representative checked boarding pass and said £50 extra charge for each item that is not in the carry-on including laptop, iPad, jackets, personal purse, vanity, medications. Tried to put all of the items in carry on bag for all 4 passengers. In order to avoid paying £50 for each person, threw away two personal bags and stuffed all in checked in bags. Laptop, iPad, money bag and jacket was left in one personal bag. Representative insisted to stuff  all in 1 carry on because no personal items allowed. I showed her the board outside the boarding area, which says allowed personal items, she said, ""the board is not applicable to my ticket"". EasyJet was my connecting flight. We started with the same carryon on WestJet Airlines from Los Angeles to Calgary to Gatwick. Same carry-on with personal items was okay with WestJet but wasn’t okay with EasyJet. Representative said each airline has their policy. I charged £50 to my credit card and told her that easyjet will get 4 bad reviews today, she said, ""nothing she could do"". Now I’ll have to go to baggage claim for the one of the carry-on's that were checked in, which will delay my plans in Paris. I was in my seat at 2.25 pm, flight left the gate at 2.45 pm, take off at 3.10 pm (instead of 2.10 pm). Landed in Paris at 5.10 pm (instead of 4.10 pm). Baggage took 30 minutes to arrive at baggage area. Uber ride started at 6.10, overall 1.5 hours lost. I’m sure there is no penalty to EastJet for delays because we all sign fine print agreement upfront that says ""airlines are never wrong and they will pay nothing for customer inconvenience"". Airlines inside were okay, food offered at reasonable cost, water was available at cost. Of course no Entertainment. It was cold and no blankets or pillows were provided. Thank goodness I took out my jacket from the checked in bag. No announcement to apologize for delay in departure or arrival to Paris. I may have saved £50 when I booked my tickets but ended up paying that back to EasyJet, airline found an easy way to make money. Is there any governing body that could punish bad and intentionally fraudulent practices by airlines like EasyJet? I’m not sure if my review will make any change in EasyJet’s behavior towards their customers. Don’t they know flight will depart late, boarding will be late because it arrived late? If yes, why did they announce at 1.35 that the gate is closing and made us run? I’m sure many customers felt the stress and pain due to EasyJet’s unprofessional behavior and bad communications with customers. Considering my experience, I’m not going to fly again with EasyJet. There were other customers at the gate explaining similar issues, I’m sure they wouldn’t fly and give bad reviews. All my friends will stay away from EasyJet.

417,J Marten,Canada,2019-06-06,3,"I had flown with Easy Jet seven years ago, and at the time, we got a low fare, but then there were many additional charges that were added. That was fine, as they were honest about it from the word go, and I knew what to expect. In booking with them for a flight to Sofia from Gatwick, I looked on line, and was pleased to see that they now included one cabin bag and personal item in the cost of their tickets, so I booked with them. I assumed that this was an attempt to compete with other discount airlines like Ryanair, etc. We checked in on line, and while waiting at the gate to board, there was an EasyJet employee going through the line and picking people out of the line and charging them a 50 pound fine for having an extra bag. She got a number of people as she did this and had a machine at the ready to charge our credit cards. When I protested, she said that our personal items were too big, and that I should have read the terms and conditions more carefully. How many people do that? Without being a member of their ""Easy travellers"" group, it was the same as always, and we were ""fined"" 100 pounds because our personal items were too large. Had we known, we would have factored that additional charge into the cost of our flight, and would have likely flown with someone else as the EasyJet flight was much more than other airlines with the additional baggage cost, and they flew at inconvenient times, and into the nasty, old disused terminal at Sofia Airport.

They were exceptional in their treatment of her. They took her fears seriously and she even had the opportunity to speak to the captain on the homeward flight. They are responsible for helping my daughter go a long way to overcoming her anxieties which means so much to her. They also took her peanut allergy very seriously and announced over the tannoy that they would not be selling peanuts and asked that any passenger having a packet of peanuts not to open them. I flew to Jamaica with Delta Airlines in January and advised them that I am a nervous flyer (not phobic like my daughter) but at not one point did they do anything to alleviate my anxieties. People expect a lot when flying-and I get that-but the personal touch was incredible on these flights-including the ground crew. I just want to thank them for what they did and how their treatment of my daughter has helped her to overcome her fear of flying.

436,B Lawson,United Kingdom,2019-04-23,1,"Lisbon to Luton. My daughter and I spent around £550 on return flights to Lisbon including extra legroom seats. However, we weren’t aware that on the return journey this would mean we were part of the lazy crew’s party near the front of the plane. This activity all seemed to centre on friends they also had on the plane - and I know from a friend of my daughter that Easyjet staff can add anyone as family so we suspect high fares such as ours subsidise flights of any random person the crew might know. There was one guy in an EasyJet uniform who was a passenger but was sitting in the best seats in the house given lots of free food by his over attentive friend (before anyone else was served). Subsided again by paying passengers? Regular passengers such as we were overlooked (the guy at the end of our row was asked if he wanted anything but we weren’t). The crew later deny this but asking requires eye contact and a response. You’d think they’d want to sell their pricey refreshments but this crew were only eager to socialise with mates. They were banging against the barrier between us and them throughout the flight, carrying on so loudly we couldn’t hear through our headphones. People trying to get to the loo had to wait down the aisle. Complete joke. At the end of the flight the cabin manager made a jokey PA announcement thanking the crew for their hard work. He was laughing about it. You couldn’t make this stuff up. I laughed as well for different reasons - another crew member and the off-duty staff member sitting across our row immediately begin to challenge me so I told them the truth - no service and loud noise meant for a rotten flight. Well these guys didn’t like that and began denying everything. We held our ground and the off-duty guy became quite aggressive, almost shouting. On other airlines if a passenger did that they’d call the cops. The cabin manager told him to stop (in a far more polite way than he was speaking to us) and this off-duty guy loudly retorts that as he is a passenger he’ll do what he wants. I told him I wasn’t some weakling he could push around and at that point the pilot came out, ignored me and went to speak to my daughter- who was by now near the plane door and quite upset as she’s a nervous flyer and these lunatics weren’t helping. Pilot just said “Sorry for the inconvenience.” To quote the crew member when I told him I had video of their ‘party’ - “whatever”. Who trains these people? No one would be my guess. The off-duty guy laughed and carried on in the bus in front of us with his friends on the way back to the terminal - completely unaffected by his actions.

We booked our flight two and a half months ahead of time, and when I went to check-in for my flight, the website had said I had to visit the desk when I arrived at the airport. Thinking there was no issue, I arrived at the airport for EasyJet to tell me that I did not have a seat on the plane. Her exact words were, ""You paid for the flight, not for a seat."" Apparently, people who pay 24 euros extra to choose their seat have priority in getting a seat on the plane over those who do not. So, since they overbooked the flight, I did not have a seat on the plane I paid for (and neither did my friend), but our other friend did and had to travel to Paris alone. A worker escorted my friend and I to a counter where we got a new reservation for a flight that was 5 hours later than our original flight. We did get a 9 euro voucher and ""speedy boarding,"" but overall a flawed system and do not recommend booking with EasyJet unless you want to pay 24 euros extra to choose a seat or want to run the risk of spending 10 hours (total) in the airport.

Our flight was cancelled the morning of our flight and after talking to the easyJet staff we were told no flights would be available for the next 2 days including the day that we were intended to fly. The strange part was that there were other easyJet flights flying out of the same airport the same afternoon just a few hours after our flight was cancelled due to a ""strike"". We had reservations and plans booked in Venice in advance for this trip so we needed to get to our destination. There is no travel insurance that will reimburse you for your cancelled flight unless the entire airport was shut down due to weather - that leaves it up the the airline. Travel insurance will also not reimburse you for costs incurred due to the cancelation and will not reimburse for reservations that were ruined as a result. There was no offered compensation or alternative option of travel offered by the airline. We were refunded the cost of our flight but that does not compare to that we needed to book tickets on an alternative airline which cost 9 fold.

445,Alex Nicholls,United Kingdom,2019-04-02,1,"Flights to and from Amsterdam from Gatwick booked weeks ahead and both journeys checked in before we left the UK. Not the cheapest flights available but economy. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before flying, in plenty of time, clear security easily and go to the gate area to wait for a specific gate. 10 mins before the scheduled departure another passenger notices that the departure time has changed from 19.45 (imminently) to 17.50, no other information. This causes other passengers to check their app to discover, then relate to us, that the flight has been cancelled. Not delayed, just cancelled, and that the 17.50 departure is the next day, Saturday. Savvy frequent flyers rushed off, knowing what to do, some even got alternative flights with other airlines. We were left standing with no information and no instructions what to do. There were no EasyJet staff on hand to explain, to offer suggestions or just tell us where to go. Eventually we found an information desk and they directed us back out to the Departures hall (back through the Baggage Hall and Passport Control) to the EasyJet check in guest where the other 150 or more passengers were waiting to find out what they were going to do. I waited in the queue for about 90 minutes to get to the front to be handed a piece of paper with the name of a hotel on it and the next day's flight details. It took them 30 seconds to give it to me. When I asked why they didn't just hand that out to the whole queue the poor desk staff, (who were not EasyJet staff just local airport representatives), said sorry the 40 rooms they had at the airport were full so we had to go back into town. So a train back in Amsterdam, a taxi to the hotel (which was very nice) but no meal as promised by EasyJet and by then the kitchens were closed. The next day our replacement flight is the last one out of Amsterdam, not the first or anything else during the day. The amazing thing is that there are no EasyJet people to talk to. None of the staff are theirs, not the check in or the gate staff. They know EasyJet are rubbish so they are practised at apologising. Don't fall for the cheap price, it's not worth it. The delays are inevitable, the cancellations random and the service non-existent. Pay a little bit more to know that when it does go wrong, as it will, there is someone there that can help you. The next day I had downloaded the app in order to check in on line. Using the flight tracker I could see the incoming flight from Alicante. Maybe the day before it came from somewhere else but the method is; plane comes in, offloads passengers then gets sent on somewhere else. The Friday flight was cancelled due to 'a staff welfare issue'.  Whatever, it must have been known about on the other flight, for some time, to allow then to make alternative arrangements for a spare pilot, 2nd officer, navigator?, cabin crew. But no, EasyJet don't do that because they care more about the bottom line than customer service. About 180 passengers on an A320 Airbus. Each passenger entitled to a minimum of 250 euro compensation plus hotel rooms, transfers, food etc, could cost them 63,000 as a conservative estimate for 1 cancelled flight.

The agent refused to have me check in without such a proof. She argued that this regulation had been put in place years ago and started yelling as I was insisting. I traveled to Israel more than 30 times and never heard about such a regulation. I asked to be shown this regulation in a written form. No one could at Paris airport. Still, I was forced to book a flight online as I was about to miss my plane.I ended up booking a bad ticket money- and travel-wise as I was so much rushing to be able to board my flight. After arriving at Ben Gurion, I asked around about this regulation.No member of the Israeli staff had heard about it. I sent a request for clarification at easyJet customer service. The request was sent on Jan.30th. I was told that a proper answer would come within 27 days. It came almost two months later with the following content: ""Regulations vary depending on which country you fly to and from therefore I will not be able to provide you with the suitable information regarding travel documents, I can advise that you call your local Embassy or Consulate in this regard"".

Things started with a 45 minutes delay leaving, which is routine but not excusable, on their flights later in the day. The latest seats are now so thinly padded and packed in that people can’t help poking each other’s arms or kneeing each other’s backs and sitting down for a flight of a few hours is altogether very uncomfortable. The cabin was clean. The crew were fairly pleasant, seemed safety conscious, were all young and did their tasks efficiently. The quality and price ratio in the range of on board drinks and snacks is significantly better than the competition but the substantive fresh food is dull, often understocked on returns and of low quality. I wouldn’t ever pay for any speedy boarding - but those that did have such privileges for one reason or another didn’t get any benefit from it in Cyprus. Instead, the queue surged forward for us to spend the traditional half an hour queuing on a jetway staircase before walking over the runway to the plane. Boarding on the plane was chaotic, involved arguments between crew and passengers about locker space, and caused delay.

But what can I expect, Its a cheap airline so no chance for getting anything decent for a low price. The seating is not great but is better than most of the other budget airlines.

482,W Baker,United States,2018-12-16,1,"Let me begin by saying this is by far the worst flight experience I have ever had, and that begins prior to even leaving the tarmac. We begin by finding out our gate only 20 min prior to boarding. After rushing to the site and waiting in an incredibly slow moving line, we were met by a customer service representative stating our bags did not meet requirements, and would not give a clear explanation as to what the requirements were. As the line behind us was so long, she barked orders at us and suggested we pay the GBP50 baggage fee as opposed to finding a solution so she could get the line moving, and perhaps make some commission. Finally, she checked a bag for us for the price of dealing with her attitude. We continued onto the plane where we were made to wait 1hr to leave the tarmac due to a single missing passenger. We found this out through a series of unprofessional announcements from a male flight attendant. Beyond that, some occurrence with a lithium battery unidentified was in a checked bag, resulting in an additional 40 minute delay to find the device (this could be a source of easyjets abnormal 1 bag policy forcing someone to decompose their bag and repack it in a rush). His child was vomiting as they searched for his bag. On top of this, France went on strike during this process creating an even longer delay as we had to reroute around them. The only compensation to be offered was lukewarm water. Flight attendants could later be found charging people on the flight for snacks and beverages since they were now 2 hrs behind on dinner. This is the consequence of LGW’s overall disorganization as a facility along with the poor quality of easy jet to design practical tools for their employees to meet customer service needs. We are extremely dissatisfied customers and will not be flying with easyJet again in the future.

Obvious no recline - seats bolt upright and poor legroom. Did not expect any service and an announcement was made that due to flying time if we want anything to press the call bell. This is fair enough. The brochure prices seemed ok and there was a good range on offer. The flight crew announcements - very professional.

It was at the airport that I realized I didn't have my passport. I went up to the Easyjet desk and explained to them that I do not have my passport and it most likely was left at a shop in Central Rome. At this time, it was only an assumption that my passport was there. This is because I received a missed call from a Rome number the night before.  I spoke to the man about my situation and he said that it would be fine for me to go retrieve my passport and come back and book a flight (fully knowing that my original flight was at 9:50 am and it would take me 2 hours round trip to get my passport from Central Rome). He said that once I had my passport he can go ahead and book a new flight for me no problem, I just had to pay the difference. I wanted to make sure I knew everything I needed to know before leaving the airport and just wanted reassurance that there would be space available for me when I come back to book my flight to Paris. He said everything was fine, just go get my passport. I come back to the airport and an employee says there is nothing she can do and that I had to buy a completely new flight. I told her I had spoken to her colleague this morning and he said I can pay the difference. I tried to ask her understand my situation and that her colleague had told me otherwise.

However the company shows a completely different character if anything non-standard occurs and the customer experience now becomes a completely different one. EasyJet pre-emptively cancelled a Marseilles to Bristol flight at the end of June on the basis of a threatened French air traffic control strike. In the event there was no strike. For myself and my wife I spent £530 pounds and not a little stress to return to Bristol by train.​ ​ I have since attempted to recover these costs under 'Expense Claim. Replacement Travel to your Destination'. That's where the fun starts. To attempt any interaction with Customer Services or the mis-named 'Resolution Team' unearths a most unpleasant side to the happy, smiling image the Company would like to portray.​ ​ I attempted to upload travel receipts to the online claim form. Problem. Webchat agent twice told me it would only work with Google Chrome! Advised to forward all by mail to Luton. Eventually Customer Services replied to say claims were only allowable online. Again told to use Google Chrome despite quite efficiently receiving my payments for many years by Internet Explorer/Edge. Another Webchat agent under duress sent me a link to send all claims documents. Sent but worryingly no acknowledgement. Webchat again promised response from Claims within 24 hrs. Nothing. Tried phoning but gave up after 1hr15mins. Sent complaint. Promised response within 28 days. Still waiting after 40. Webchat again. Usual pre-scripted press-button patronising platitudes but promised a response same day! Silly me to get excited because nothing. Today another little webchat. I was informed that the CASE HAS BEEN closed and that I should call the Resolution Team ! Now it's getting laughable.....if only! Tried phoning them this morning but lost the will to live after 1hr10mins and gave up.​ ​ I've now got much better things to do. So, easyjet you have avoided yet another justifiable recompense through your patently obvious policy of distraction, obfuscation, confusion, frustration, false sympathy, untruths and diversion. I am sure someone somewhere is happy but in reality you should be totally ashamed.​",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Marseilles to Bristol,June 2018,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,,2,no,True,Marseilles,Bristol,,Neutral,0.2393,  use many many time since early flight everything reasonably acceptable give limitation intricate trickery booking system however company show completely different character anything occur customer experience become completely different one cancel marseille bristol end june basis threaten french air traffic control strike event strike wife spend pound little stress return bristol since attempt recover cost claim replacement travel destination fun start attempt interaction customer service team unearths unpleasant side happy smile image company like attempted upload travel receipt online claim form problem webchat agent twice work google chrome advise forward mail luton eventually customer service reply say claim allowable online use google chrome despite quite efficiently receive payment many year internet another webchat agent duress send link send claim document send worryingly acknowledgement webchat promise response claim within 24 hr nothing try phone give 1hr15mins sent complaint promise response within 28 day still wait 40 webchat usual patronising platitude promise response day silly get excited nothing today another little webchat informed case close call resolution team get laughable tried phone morning lose live 1hr10mins give get much good thing avoid yet another justifiable recompense patently obvious policy distraction obfuscation confusion frustration false sympathy untruths diversion sure someone somewhere happy reality totally

First of all, I had to wait for the whole line at bag drop even though I was already checked in. Secondly no one told me that if you’re using the service you’re not allowed to have a small bag with you for passport and water so I got fined for 60 euros, while if I had my suitcase with me I would just put my small bag inside. Thirdly, I was promised to be one of the first to get their bags, which didn’t happen and I had to wait for almost 40 minutes while the other passengers where already taking their bags.

516,Brian Watling,United Kingdom,2018-09-28,9,Luton to Heraklion. Well the flight and cabin crew are first class but the airline is let down by the ground handling agents it uses. Our flight out from Luton was boarded and pushed back from the stand and head down the taxi way towards the run way only to be met half way down by a follow me car from the airport and parked on a remote stand at Luton. This was after what I can describe has the worst aircraft marshalling I have seen since I watched a charity clip by the RAF on UTUBE. Luton Airport wonders why it is getting so many bad reviews and bad press. Why board an aircraft which you know is going to be subjected to a 30 minute delay. The aircraft captain told everyone that the was an ATC delay due to congestion en route but this would of been known before the aircraft was boarded so why board it? But when we did get underway the crew due to tail winds were able to make up the 30 minute delay and arrival on stand on time. The service on board was slick and professional. The menu was good value for money and we had pre ordered which is a new service and I can recommend this to any one. The return trip we left 35 minutes late due to the aircraft which was been used arriving late from its trip to Luton. However again the crew were able to make up 20 minutes of the flight time arriving into Luton 15 minutes late. But due to the non existent cowboy ground handling company and the jobs worth mentality of its staff who could only manage to be bothered to use one set of aircraft stairs for a full A320 which was parked on a remote stand meant we were kept waiting 35 minutes before we got into the terminal building.,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Luton to Heraklion,September 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,5,yes,True,Luton,Heraklion,,Negative,-0.7506,  luton heraklion well cabin crew first class let ground handle agent use luton board push back stand head taxi way towards run way meet half way follow car airport park remote stand luton describe bad marshal see since watch charity clip raf utube luton airport wonder get many bad review bad press board know go subject 30 minute delay captain everyone atc delay due congestion en route know board board get underway crew due tail wind able make 30 minute delay arrival stand time service board slick professional menu good value money pre order new service recommend one return trip leave 35 minute late due use arrive late trip luton however crew able make 20 minute time arrive luton 15 minute late due non existent cowboy ground handle company job worth mentality staff manage bother use one set stairs full a320 park remote stand mean keep wait 35 minute get terminal building

527,D Lanson,United Kingdom,2018-09-17,3,"Lisbon to Luton. This was my first time using EasyJet. I was surprised how many people try to carry on huge bags. This meant that staff were taking bags from people to put them in the hold whilst they were queuing to get on the plane. Unfortunately this meant a two tier system as some were lucky and got away with huge bags whilst others were not. The staff were firm but also rude and insisted one lady exited the queue to go and pay for her luggage to be placed in the hold. EasyJet should make it clear that all bags larger than the size listed in their website will be placed in the hold and charged for and this should be enforced at check in, not afterwards. Our flight was delayed by around 2.5 hours. Anxious not to pay each traveller the £3 we were entitled to we were boarded into a priority access area. Queued to go through an electronic passport check only to have queue to have them checked again before boarding. Once on board we err asked to sit quickly to avoid losing the take off slot. Then a staff member demanded boarding passes from some passengers. She was rude and abrupt with them and offered no explanation for her demand despite the passenger being very pleasant with her. The delay meant we were travelling at dinner time and the food options are very basic. Due to the quick changeover the choices were further reduced as they quickly ran out of some selections. Food is poor. I was in row 8. I got the last ham and cheese sandwich. It was really dry. Pretty gross really even for airline food. My husband opted for a bacon baguette. Strangely the bacon was just about cooked but the baguette was dry. He had to ask for the ketchup it was supposed to come with and was given one sachet despite the advert offering two sachets.

This was the worst airline I have travelled.I always book my flights through a company but for the first time I decided to book online, and I want a direct flight and this one was my only option to get to my destination. First of all, the customer service was beyond awful, they treat people like trash! When we arrived to the airport, they have a separate terminal far away from the main airport only for easyjet, it was packed! Thank god we arrived early, it was packed and when it was our turn, since we are a family traveling, they dont accept any more 1kg, so they made us open and remove from our luggage or else we pay 14€ per 1kg. We did that then when we arrived to the checking point, a lady was there that stopped as and told us that our ticket allow us to only have one cabin bag for each person, meaning that us ladies who carry a handbag and has a small carry on bag, can’t go in with both unless they already have payed for a ticket that allow you to carry both! I And they make you put your carry on bag in a metal thing to see if it fits or not, if it doesn’t, you have to go back and pay extra to load your cabin bag as if its a luggage bag, 47€ per bag if it doesn’t fit that thing, and if we wanna do that whole thing we have to stand in line for another hour, so they have the option to pay 16€ to get into “fast lane” which changes your seat to the front seat. It’s a money-sucking company, definitely not a saver, you will pay the money you saved on things you didn’t even thought of, if you’re on a budget and traveling alone, dont have much stuff, go for it, if you’re a family traveling definitely I don’t recommend it!

Then, all the passengers had to wait for further instructions until 2 am. No one told us in the company offered us help or gave us an explanation, we had to go ourselves. There was a group of elderly people that were sitting uncomfortably on the luggage claim. Of course, easyjet’s staff didn’t care. Two passengers were kind enough to get some chairs from the reception for the elderly. At 2am one bus arrived and we weren’t even told. The staff just left us wait without any updates. Ironically we get the updates from the passengers instead of the staff. The nightmare continue when your company hire a bus driver who doesn't didn’t know the direction of the hotel. He drove in circles around the airport for an hour until we reach the hotel which was very far from Paris. By the time we get to to check in to the room it was already 3 am and we had to get up early in order to get breakfast. Next day (July 18th), we found ourselves with the same situation. We had to ask for updates ourselves on what to do next. We were told to go to the airport to settle everything. If we hadn’t done that we would lose the bus to the airport. Once we were there, they told us there are no more flights today, so we need to stay in a hotel until Saturday (21th of July), when there’s a flight to Edinburgh.

540,S Malinski,Spain,2018-08-18,3,"Berlin to Copenhagen with easyjet operated by Smarlynx Estonia. The flight itself was very smooth and no nonsense. The ground services however were abysmal. I arrived way too early at the airport (3h before departure) and still had to run to get on the plane. It all began when I received and email saying that the overhead lockers on-board this SmartLynx A320 are too small to fit easyjets usual cabin baggage. It also said that I could drop off my cabin luggage at the easyjet plus check in desks. To confirm that I asked at customer services if I could indeed drop off my bag at that desk to which they said yes. When the check in for my flight opened, I came back to the terminal to find an immense line to the counters. Fortunately the easyjet plus desk had no such line. I went there and then got called at and kicked out by a ground operations worker and had to endure 2h of line for the normal check in. In the end we got called to a separate desk because if not we would not have made it to our gate on time. When I finally reached a desk, the employee had no idea what I was talking about when I explained the situation with the cabin luggage and needed help from 2 other employees. Finally I dropped of my bag and sprinted towards the gate. I made it to my gate with my belt in my hand because I didn't even have time to put it back on after security.

552,G Leeson,United Kingdom,2018-07-30,7,"Late evening departure out of Copenhagen for Gatwick on bank holiday Monday. We arrived at Copenhagen airport just over an hour before the flight, and were surpised to be called for the flight almost inmediately we had passed through security. Walking through the airport I realised why, however - the budget airline wing of CPH is a very long way away from the main lounge area. The gate area for the budget flights is basic but there is a small shop for snacks and drinks. Boarding into a 'pen' commenced before arrival of the incoming flight, so we were stood in a queue for quite a while, but boarding was rapid once the inbound flight had arrived. Only real negative was the plane had clearly not been cleaned on the turnaround, and there was a fair amount of rubbish inside. The aircraft was one of the older easyJet planes and was showing its age - they really could do with a refurb of the older planes in the fleet now. Once on board, the pilot announced that storms were causing major delays into Gatwick and we might have to wait some time - an hour or more - for a takeoff slot. However, 15 minutes later the pilot informed us that he had managed to pursuade Gatwick to give us an earlier slot and we were cleared for takeoff straight away - I was impressed at these efforts. In flight, the crew were as good as I've come to expect from easyJet and the pilots gave the customary route updates, which are always welcome. We landed at Gatwick 15 minutes early, which was impressive as I noted from the arrivals board that almost every other flight that evening had a 1 hour or longer delay.

I used to fly with them which was a basic, but positive experience most of the time, but over the last months all my flights have been delayed. They seem not to manage to manage their connections when they blame unforeseen circumstances for delays and cancellations.

We decided to walk around and buy gifts for for our family inside AMS airport.

She was rude when speaking to us.

557,J Hawthorn,United Kingdom,2018-07-24,3,Inverness to Luton. Third time in a row spectacularly delayed by easyJet this year. The last two have seemingly been a reflection of the poor resilience built into their schedules which are over complicated by crisscrossing all over Europe. They just cannot bee relied on for domestic U.K. travel. Be extremely worried if you receive an email a few days before your flight if it says that the flight will be operated by easyJet Europe as this seems to mean inevitable delays happen. On this occasion the incoming flight arrived late and so missed its window to then avoid a weather related issue at Luton. EasyJet initially refused to pay out compensation because of the Luton related weather issues - when it was pointed out to them that their own flights landed at Luton around the time mine was due to land and BA had found it possible to depart Inverness later and arrive at Heathrow on time they then blamed more French traffic control and weather systems in Europe. This seems to be an airline that cannot respond to any small issue elsewhere in Europe and then meet its timetable. In future I will either use a more expensive but reliable flat carrier or the train. The train would have been quicker all the way from Inverness to London with these delays and they pay out if just 30 minutes late whoever fault it is. The only positive was helpful cabin crew who gave people free food and drinks and dealt well with an unruly passenger and booted him off.,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Inverness to Luton,May 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,,1.0,,1,no,True,Inverness,Luton,,Negative,-0.8622,  inverness luton third time row spectacularly delay year last two seemingly reflection poor resilience build schedule complicate crisscross europe bee rely domestic travel extremely worried receive email day say operate europe seem mean inevitable delay happen occasion incoming arrive late miss window avoid weather related issue luton initially refuse pay compensation luton relate weather issue point flight land luton around time mine due land ba find possible depart inverness later arrive heathrow time blame french traffic control weather system europe seem respond small issue elsewhere europe meet timetable future either use expensive reliable flat carrier train train quicker way inverness london delay pay 30 minute late whoever fault positive helpful cabin crew give people free food drink deal well unruly passenger boot
558,K Handic,Switzerland,2018-07-24,7,"Basel to Funchal. I flew with my family on easyJets new cabin. It was a standard seat with no additional legroom. The flight was fully booked and four hours long, but it was fine, as the seat was very comfortable and the legroom, thanks to the thin seats, surprisingly good. The cabin was quite clean, although I didn't visit the lavatory, so I can't judge on that. The wine and olives I ordered (and payed) were excellent. The only thing that in my opinion could be improved are the tray tables. They're actually quite small and I'm sure a 15"" laptop wouldn't be usable to do work or anything that requires using the keyboard.

561,David Griffiths,United Kingdom,2018-07-22,7,"I've never had a seriously bad experience with a flight. However easyJet really must do something about the quality of their ground handling. I don't know who handles them in Vienna but we arrived to drop our bags and found the easyJet Plus counter unmanned. Thinking we were slightly early we waited. After a few minutes we were approached by a man who peremptorily ordered us to join the main queue. I refused point blank and told him as easyJet Plus customers we expected to get what we'd paid for, i.e. priority service. With no good grace he got behind the counter himself and did what he had to do so abruptly that I was surprised when our bags arrived in Edinburgh. Not a good way to treat loyal customers. At Edinburgh we landed ten minutes early and Menzies Aviation ran true to form. Firstly we came to a grinding stop on the apron because, as a clearly exasperated Captain told us, nobody had turned on the ground guidance system required for the aircraft to park on the stand. Having finally got on stand we then sat unable to deplane for almost a quarter of an hour because there were no steps. Three women with day-glo jackets and clipboards stood outside chatting, occasionally looking at the aircraft and clearly doing nothing useful. Once we eventually got off I asked a day-glo lady if the aircraft's arrival had come as a surprise to them. ""Well we were waiting for the steps"" was the response. Gosh, you don't say. I know from this and several similar experiences that you obviously don't have enough kit or enough people to handle the aircraft you're paid to handle. Not good enough. Come on easyJet, your product is good but the incompetence of your ground handlers annoys your customers and delays your flights.

On each occasion the flights were late with the delays being 70 minutes, 45 minutes and 2 hours respectively. On board staff were as helpful and apologetic as they could have been, but the impression remains of an airline that has severe organisational and punctuality issues. Information provided via their app and at the airport is inconsistent and unreliable and boarding is not well organised or pleasant with passengers being corralled into enclosures like cattle before boarding and then made to wait for an indefinite amount of time. When fees for seat reservations and hold bags are taken into account the price advantage over legacy airlines is marginal at best.

573,S Moxhay,United Kingdom,2018-07-06,1,"I had one of the worst experiences of any company ever when I attempted to fly with Easyjet. It has cost me £510, a day at Stansted airport and ruined my husband’s birthday. We arrived at the airport at 11am for a flight at 1:05pm. We checked a bag in and went to departures. After going to the allocated gate about 45mins before flight departure time we waited and were told there was a technical issue with the plane and were then told that we would need to get another plane which was due to land shortly. Then an hour at the gate with no further news. Then there was an announcement saying we should go back to the departure lounge as there was a gate change. We were taken by bus back to the departure lounge and when we looked at the screen info it flashed up that the plane would be leaving in 1 hours time and that the gate was 81. I looked online at the Easyjet flight tracker which still said that the plane was due to leave about 20mins previous to the current time so was incorrect. So we were not sure of when the plane would actually leave and thought we’d wait for announcements or info on screen in the departure lounge. We kept looking at the screen and all it ever said was ‘Gate change’. It didn’t say ‘go to gate’, ‘boarding’ or ever again an expected departure time. Then after about 1.5 hours it just disappeared off the screen. We were alarmed but there is no information desk at stansted to ask anyone what is going on. We wandered around until eventually asking someone with a walkie talkie who happened to be walking through. She called and found out that since we had been sitting there waiting for information our bag had been removed from the plane and it had left. No announcements had been made, no information on the board. We couldn’t believe it. They had taken our bag off the plane but hadn’t bothered to make an announcement calling us to the gate. There was never anything in the board saying ‘go to gate’ ‘boarding’ etc. Basically they hadn’t updated the screen info. We then experienced the worst customer service ever. After being dumped with various people with no explanation of what was going on we ended up speaking to the so called ‘manager’ at the Easyjet desk. She was woman called Rochelle who made no apology for our situation and could not have been less helpful, she treated us with utter contempt. I’ve never known such awful customer service. She said we should call the Easyjet phone line (which is actually a call centre in South Africa). We did this and they said the communication failure was something we should take up with Easyjet at the airport. But the representatives at the airport said it was nothing to do with them and there was no one we could complain to. Basically if something like this goes happens Easyjet are the absolute worst company to deal with. We were left unable to speak to anyone- everyone just said it wasn’t their responsibility. The awful Rochelle at one point said she didn’t actually really work for Easyjet but another company called Stobarts. So if some mistake is made at the airport you can’t complain, you lose your money and get no apology. I lost over £500 on the lost flights and holiday, it ruined my husband’s birthday and we were treated so poorly by Easyjet staff. The previous flight I got with Easyjet was delayed by 5 hours with no apology too. It’s a big mistake to choose this airline.

574,Stefano Ermacora,Switzerland,2018-07-05,1,"Milan Malpensa to Paris CDG. Flight cancelled and re-booked for the next day. Even on the next day the flight was late more than 1 hour. I lost a whole day of work. Reason given: staff had been working more than allowed?! As if easyJet doesn't know when their flights are scheduled - this happens when companies only look at costs.

They called us at the gate about an hour early and they gathered all the passengers in the rather small gate area where we had to wait quite a long time, which was rather annoying. Boarding started and I was the first on the plane thanks to speedy boarding, which I think is really worth the extra money. I was initially worried that boarding would have been absolute chaos but in the end the staff at the gate were very professional and the boarding procedure was really organized. The cabin crew and both pilots were extremely nice and friendly and the atmosphere onboard was very relaxed. Food and drink isn't too expensive and they have a really good selection.

I realised that the outbound flight was very tight and tried to change it but found that it was cheaper to book a second flight giving me the option of two - illogical but no more so than some railway journeys. The easyJet product is basic but acceptable - the aircraft was clean and the cabin crew friendly. I did not pay for allocated seating - the randomised seating that you get is a bit annoying. My main complaint is about the queuing. The outbound flight was delayed by 25 minutes. This is understandable, there were slot restrictions into AMS, but there the delay was not put on the screen seven though easyJet must have known about it and the gate closed before the plane actually got to the stand with passengers left to wait (fortunately in the gate). Don't think that you will get on a delayed flight if you are running late. There was a delay at LTN because the entry gate would not open and everyone had to wait on the apron although this was presumably down to the airport. The return flight was fine - we actually arrived on the gate a few minutes early and I wisely decided to remain seated and be the one of the last to leave the gate, given that the airline has allocated seating, having seen people waiting in lines on the ramp.

580,M Jonas,Germany,2018-06-22,7,I flew from Munich to London-Gatwick with easyjet. The big advantage about easyjet is that there is no weight limit for hand luggage. There are restrictions on the dimensions. I reserved a seat in the emergency exit row and speedy boarding. Even sitting in the emergency exit row I had barely enough space and felt cramped. The seat was really uncomfortable and even for such a short flight not recommendable. A different airline would have been 50% more expensive (about 100€ for the roundtrip) for same dates and slightly better times. Next time I will think twice before booking the cheapest flight.

But the real issue I have with easyJet (what an ironic name) is that, at that point, they simply told us they couldn't help us any further. In other words, at midnight, after sitting in the airport for hours and hours, we were now left on our own to find a hotel and find another flight. It was simply incredible. We were all left high and dry, scrambling to get ourselves out of a terrible situation the airline had put us in.

Boarding was slightly delayed as two blind passengers needed assistance. I noted though that only one staff member went out of his way to help the blind passengers.

I bought a drink and the cabin crew member walked away without rendering the change. I had to call one of his colleagues and even then I was given the wrong change and had to challenge it.

615,L Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2018-03-26,9,"Liverpool to Larnaca. I think that our recent experience clearly illustrates the difference companies like easyJet have made as far as foreign travel is concerned: we have just had a very enjoyable week’s holiday in Cyprus for less than it cost for just the flights on our first visit there over 30 years ago. On that occasion we were going to stay with friends and to reach Cyprus as “cheaply” as possible we had to drive to Heathrow, stay overnight and then travel via Budapest with a seven-hours’ layover in the airport there. Last week we had an hour’s drive to Liverpool and direct flights for two of us for a total of just over £140! We were not sure how we would cope with flights lasting 5 hours each way, as we normally restrict ourselves to 3 hours or less, but we equipped ourselves with plenty to occupy the time and the journeys were relatively painless. Both flights departed and arrived pretty promptly, cabin staff worked hard and efficiently without going over the top and the cockpit crews kept us informed. The plane on the outward journey had the new-style seats which we do not find particularly supportive though they were tolerable, but we were more comfortable on the return flight with the older, more thickly padded seats. Possibly the boarding procedure could have been handled better at Larnaca, but that might have been dictated by the airport rather than easyJet staff. One thing in particular struck me: the totally calm atmosphere on both flights – everyone seemed to be engrossed in or by whatever entertainment they had brought with them to pass the time, an indication perhaps that most clients know what to expect on an easyJet flight and are content with easyJet services, even if they do not bother to say so.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Liverpool to Larnaca,March 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,,5,yes,True,Liverpool,Larnaca,,Positive,0.9824,  liverpool larnaca think recent experience clearly illustrate difference company like make far foreign travel concern enjoyable week holiday cyprus less cost flight first visit 30 year ago occasion go stay friend reach cyprus cheaply possible drive heathrow stay overnight travel via budapest layover airport last week hour drive liverpool direct flight two us total sure cope flight last 5 hour way normally restrict 3 hour less equipped plenty occupy time journey relatively painless flight depart arrived pretty promptly cabin staff work hard efficiently without go top cockpit crew keep us informed outward journey seat find particularly supportive though tolerable comfortable return old thickly pad seat possibly board procedure handle good larnaca might dictate airport rather staff one thing particular strike totally calm atmosphere flight everyone seem engross whatever entertainment bring pas time indication perhaps client know expect content service bother say

631,Andrew Elliott,United Kingdom,2018-02-07,1,"Flew Manchester to Santorini. Simply put this was the worst service I have ever encountered when flying. When waiting to go home (in the hot sun with a 3 year old) we had to wait in excess of 3 hours while the airport authorities tried to get 37 volunteers not to fly. No reason, no explanation was given. Chaos ensued. No representative from the airline was present, instead, the airline left the announcement and the dealing with how to sort out frustrated, tired, ill, and angry passengers. The airport staff were poorly behaved, rude, threatening both physically and with the police. Apparently, after boarding (eventually) we were told that a member of the crew had fallen ill. This, according to many other reviews was frequently happening on this route and others. Problems occur, yes. But the lack of support and the lack of responsibility the airline took in the airport was astonishing. Compensation was offered for volunteers. But, no guarantee of a flight back within a week was given. So compensation meant nothing. Those who did choose compensation had real difficulties getting back to their connecting airports. The compensation did not cover, car parking, food, hotel accommodation etc., loss of earnings, connecting flights. easyJet simply did not handle this very well. It appears this is frequent occurrence. The airport staff told us too! I shall not fly with easyJet again. Simply put, they did not care about their customers. Proof - no apology, no announcements, and they did not have one of their staff step off the plane to come and explain. This would have helped a lot. No food or drinks on the return flight too!

632,R Galinez,United Kingdom,2018-02-03,1,"Liverpool to Madrid. Our last experience with Easyjet has been appalling. We got our tickets a month ago but when trying to check in the night before the flight, it turned out that there are no seats left on the plane for us! We arrived super early on the day and were told that easyjet oversells the seats and that we were 'standby passangers'. We had to wait for everyone to board and for the crew to check if anyone did not arrive, leaving empty seats (empty, but paid for!). Stressing over not getting there for a close relative's birthday, the money lost that we paid for the hotel, wasted holiday day booked off work are just the beginning of it. People must know that when they think they are getting seats on the plane, they are only really getting a possibility of a seat. We were absolutely appalled with the fact that the company got paid twice for our seats (my wife sat in the place of someone who did not travel due to serious sickness discovered very recently, as his friends told her and both her and the friends of that person were disgusted that easyjet would not accept refunds but will happily pass that seat to someone else who paid the same money and should have their own seat). We don't understand why getting the ticket and seat is not treated a contract, but instead easyjet 'has the right' to cancel it last minute and tell you that you are not going on the plane for which you bought the ticket, not due to weather or technical problems but as a result of their greed.

635,F Phagen,United Kingdom,2018-01-20,1,"Munich to Luton in August 2017. Weexperienced an overnight delay which resulted in a cancellation due to lightning strike, a new aircraft was flown from Italy to fly us back to Luton. There was one ground staff dealing with departures and arrivals at Munich airport, so as you can imagine, passengers had no idea what was going on and when we would be flying, or where we would be staying over night. The second flight was delayed by a further 5 hours 44 minutes due to technical issues (confirmed in an email). According to the EU Regulation 261/2004, we were entitled to €250 per passenger due to the delay being over three hours. It took over 4 compensation claim forms for easyJet to even respond, even then saying that we were eligible for compensation and that the money would be in our account within 15 days, it wasn’t. Phoned easyJet to get an update and see what was happening. We were then told that the second flight was delayed further due to the lightning strike. Having been in contact with some passengers on the same flight, many had already received the compensation and so I proceeded to explain this to them. He then apologised and said it was an error, and the money would be in the account within 21 day, it wasn’t. Again phoned customer service to be updated, in which I was told that the second flight was a ‘gifted free transfer’, and so compensation could not be claimed. I proceeded to explain that we had been told twice previous that we would receive the compensation. I was told this was by error and that we would not be receiving anything. I then phoned back to finally resolve the issue, and having spoken to her line manager, out of courtesy we would be transferred the compensation.

Both at Liverpool and Palma boarding was organised efficiently and promptly, with Speedy Boarders first on and off the transfer buses.

We had the usual suspects ignoring the repeated advice not to put small items in the overhead lockers, so that cabin crews then spent time tactfully trying to rearrange items to allow more trundle bags to be accommodated.

639,Imy Allen ,United Kingdom,2018-01-10,2,"So when I arrived at Bristol airport I realised that my hand luggage was slightly oversized purely due to the wheels (my fault but I have used it to fly with easyJet as hand luggage before and for Jet2 as well). I queued up to speak to someone about what to do and she took a few minutes to decide but after seeing my case wouldn't fit in the example box she said not to worry, that it was ok and charged me £5 instead of £47. There were a family who were infront of us who were 70 kilos over or weighed 70 kilos so had to cough up £70 there and then, so it was like they were picking and choosing who they would charge and what. Anyway, I was so relieved and happy, got on the plane all the cabin staff were really polite, helpful, friendly and the flight was fine. However on the way home, we arrived at the airport 2 hours early, all checked in online before hand too, we went to the gate on time to get ready to board but there was a huge queue so we walked 1 minute down the airport to a loo quickly. When we got back we were at the front of the queue and there were 2 girls who were meant to check our boarding passes/ID and before even saying hello or waiting for the person infront of me to walk onwards one of the girls shouted 'can you check that case, that looks massive' then looked up and me and said 'that's going to be £47, not even a hello or a please'. I obviously said how it was okay on the way and how I'd used it before with easyJet and Jet2 and she actually said 'well you havent' and I said well I have! Was ridiculous! Then they tried to tell us we were late, when we'd been waiting for 2 hours, so rude. Anyway after looking me and my friend up and down in a judgemental rude way I told them how I don't have the money and that I think it's ridiculous I could fly with it as hand luggage for £5 on the way and now they're wanting £47! At this point everyone had boarded the plane and we were told we were about to miss it, I had to make a quick call to my gran to borrow the money as the hotel we stayed in had taken a huge deposit too and I wasn't getting that back until a few days after we left, and after typing the card details wrong 4 times into her computer the rude girl finally charged me £47 and we had to sprint to the plane. They were so rude and didn't even say hello, please or thank you at any point and set completely different rules as we had on the way. So annoyed and appalled at the rude and unfair staff.

657,A Kamakara,Poland,2017-11-22,2,"Rome FCO to Paris Orly, it had the best price compared to the other airlines, since I was travelling with a big Indonesian group and paid for all the flight tickets for them as gifts. My experience onboard two flights were pleasant, the cabin crews were nice and the interior of the aircraft is not bad at all for a budget airline. Sadly, the good experience on board was  ruined by the horrible ground staff on both flights! On the first flight from AMS to LIN, each of us brought 1 cabin luggage & 1 small bag. We didn't realise that it was a mistake, so when we knew it from the surprisingly unfriendly Dutch ground staffs, we hurriedly packed each of our small bags to the bigger bag. So, we can say that we really tried to respect the rule. However, we felt that as an tourist group, as some passengers could bring 2 Luggage without being warned, maybe it was more because we were a big group of tourists so they wanted to show their power to us. On the second flight, we tried our best to respect the rule by only bringing 1 cabin bag for each of us. And we were positive that it wouldn't lead us to any problem. We were wrong!

Overall, not happy with easyJet. But a positive point on easyJet in comparison with other budget carriers, they allow a child traveller to have a free check-in of a stroller / car seat.

675,G Vanois,France,2017-10-06,2,"✅ Verified Review   Gatwick to Paris. I've waited 10 flights to see if things would improve - they didn't. Once you have checked in for a flight on the App, even if you change your reservation, the old boarding pass stays in the app instead of being deleted: confusing. The way to choose your seat is easy for the first flight but complicated for the return. Then you cannot change it yourself.  By the way, you can only check in until 2 hours before departure. I like to check in on the way to the airport once I know I will get my flight. No, you have to check in way before. Once, the check in with the app or via their website didn't work, so I tried to call the customer service helpline: waited 15 minutes before they answered saying they couldn't do anything. You are now on your way to the gate, it is 1/2 hour before your flight whose boarding gate is 10 minutes away. Normally no stress, not with easyjet, where they say your gate closes 25 minutes before your flight, so you run to realize it hasn't started boarding. In short, if you have a short connection, forget about your connecting flight.  You think you are better off with a more expensive Flexi fare ticket (that is what we travel with). Good thing is you could go fast lane at airport security, but in Paris at easyJet terminal there are no fast security lanes, while in Gatwick all the lanes are decently fast.  But then it is at the boarding gate that you realize how much you are robbed by speedy boarding dream: you are entitled to board first, but then you may be the one who waits the longest of all, standing in the jetway until you can board the plane.  The flight in itself is more or less OK, the staff are usually smiling, except when they bother you, at the first and emergency exit rows, to the point that you cannot have your sweater on your shoulders.

It was my first time flying with easyJet and I was a bit concerned, specially with their more strict luggage rules than what I am used to. Boarding was very slow and I must confess that the whole ""speedy boarding"" thing seems more like a gimmick, and that you are not going faster, you are just slowing everyone else instead. The plane was nice, comfortable, plane was very clean and seats were fare more spacious than what I would though, as the cabin was equipped with the new Airbus seats which provide so much more knee room! I really enjoyed the colours of the cabin. Staff was very friendly and even passed with a garbage bag before landing to let passenger get rid of all there garbage, not even normal airlines do that so I was not expecting it in a low cost airline.

Tried to purchase seats at check-in but we were told the flight was already full and this would not be possible. Boarding was announced a good 45 minutes before we took off but this being EasyJet, it took all of that time to get people moving onto the plane. The usual stress of a lengthy queue going nowhere, ground staff coming through to check every bag they could get their orange labels on into the hold, etc etc. Our seats were beyond uncomfortable - my partner is 6'7"" and was pretty much paralysed in place for the entire flight.

692,S Campanella,United Kingdom,2017-08-22,1,"✅ Verified Review   Gatwick to Milan Malpensa. I bought the speedy-boarding option. When I arrived at the boarding line, the pre-boarding was already started. So I've been asked to put a label over my luggage to put it in the hold. Apparently the number of available spaces were ended. I just would like to know why they don't simply count. They know how many speedy boarding there are. They know if they've done the check-in and if they are inside the airport. I've seen with my eyes their staff counting with paper and pen how many luggages there are. So, the question is: is it so difficult to reserve the spaces for the speedy boarding customers? They even claim that you can get an additional luggage with you and you can skip the queue. But not if you arrive a few minutes after the started pre-boarding. When they offer to buy the speedy boarding you should tell that some advantages are valid only for a few minutes. On the flight there were free spaces for luggage and a lot of them were used for something that, based on their policy, should stay under the seat. To conclude: if you just wanna go from point A to B, it can be ok easyJet. If you're expecting to pay to have a bit better service, avoid easyJet.

695,M Larson,Australia,2017-08-16,1,"✅ Verified Review   Gatwick to Madrid. Our experience with Easyjet was horrendous. Our flight was cancelled at the last minute, and we were notified at the boarding gate after our initial departure time. We were initially told that all flights to Madrid Barajas were being cancelled due to bad weather conditions, however a quick Google search confirmed that this was not true and that ours was the only cancelled flight to Madrid that day. We were escorted out of the airport to a poorly organised customer service area where we were promised by the customer service staff members that we would be refunded for our flights and reimbursed for our new flights to Madrid, transportation costs, accommodation and even food expenditure. We were told that we could not book another flight to Madrid with Easyjet until Monday the 10th (in over 3 days) as their flights were fully booked until then. This was not true, as they were still offering flights for that weekend on their website. However, we couldn’t do anything about it as their ‘support’ staff were unresponsive and dismissive, so we went back home to central London, and tried to look up affordable alternatives that would get us to Madrid in time for the music festival we had paid a lot of money to attend, and to the Airbnb that we had already paid for as well. The cheapest tickets we could find were £200 stand-by tickets (each) with Iberia, on top of the £80 each we had already paid for the Easyjet flight. After leaving Madrid, we were informed by Easyjet that they were actually not going to be refunding us the cost of the flights as their flight was cancelled due to bad weather, and they added that they could not refund our Gatwick express tickets as we sent them a copy of the bank receipt of the tickets with corresponding photos of the tickets, rather than an itemised receipt that we were not given from the station clerk. Overall, because the cancelled Easyjet flight, we had to spend: £280 per person for the flights, £35 each for the Gatwick Express, a wasted £60 on pre-booked accommodation in Madrid, and a lot of stress. That is over £1000 wasted between three people for a short-haul trip.

697,Christopher Rainbow,United Kingdom,2017-08-10,5,"✅ Verified Review   This review relates to a flight from Toulouse to London Gatwick in August 2017. I shall try and be candid and clear and as impartial as I can. Firstly, I found the website easy to use and clear and follow-up emails were constructive and informative. I found the Easyjet luggage charges to be very pricey. Check-in as operated in Toulouse was efficient and the staff well-presented and polite. While checking in I was aware of several elderly people struggling and no one being helped. Toulouse is often used by people travelling to and from Lourdes and as such attracts pilgrims and frail people seeking spiritual input. The flight to London was delayed by around 50 mins and passengers were herded into a waiting area. I witnessed an elderly gentleman struggle as there were no seats for him and staff ignored his pleas for help. I assisted the gentleman down a steep flight of stairs as the boarding process entailed steep stairs and then more stairs to board the flight. During the boarding of the flight only one crew member welcomed passengers and I saw 2 other crew members ignore elderly people struggling to place items into the overhead compartments. The safety demonstration as taken seriously and conducted in a professional manner. Snacks were available for purchase. The crew failed to deal with an irresponsible parent who allowed her child to run up and down the aisle during the flight.

Flew Copenhagen to Paris CDG. I flew all over Europe for a month taking bargain airlines and flew easyJet three times.

Two flights on easyJet were delayed, one had the worst turbulence I've experienced and we had to circle before landing, their policy on carry on bags is absurd. Every other airline if you carry a bag and a backpack you're fine but you can volunteer to check for free, but with easyJet you have to either stuff them into one or pay $60 in order to check the bag.

705,Pavel Moravec,Czech Republic,2017-07-23,1,"✅ Verified Review   Larnaca to Berlin SFX. This was my worst experience flying. It all started when I was on my way to to the airport when I received message that plane would be 40 minutes delay and while at the airport another when it said 2 hours and 15 minutes, that was bad but OK. Plane departed 2 hours later than scheduled, but that's when fun begin, Captain told us that we might not be able to land in Berlin because airport is closing at midnight and we might not get exception which was the case so we were diverted to Rostok. We were told that buses will be waiting for us when we exit the terminal and message from EasyJet said that cabin crew will be there to assist us and will give us some food and drinks. Reality was a bit different, when we got out, there was one bus which was close and driver nowhere to be seen (we were one of the 3 aircraft) and cabin crew got into their shuttles and left, I've stopped one from other aircraft (from my already left) and she told me to ask person at the airport, there was no person at the airport. It took almost an hour until somebody came and finally let us on the bus. I could understand that things like diverting can happen, but the way EasyJet handled that is beyond terrible, I thought that cabin crew should never abandoned their passengers like this.

712,S Gardner,Singapore,2017-07-02,1,"✅ Verified Review  This is a direct return trip from London Luton Airport to Paris and back with easyJet. To be fair, the trip to Paris was ok, but the flight back was terrible, with not one, but a series of unpleasant occurrences. The problematic flight from Paris to London Luton was due to set off at 9:55pm, but was delayed by an hour and took off at 10:55pm Paris time. Despite the delay, the boarding procedures were extremely inefficient. There was no sense of urgency despite the tardiness, especially given the fact that this is such a late flight. The gate number also changed mid-way through the delayed hour. When we scanned the boarding pass, my friend was stopped by one of the staff as he was carrying two backpacks. Despite the fact some people's roller cabin luggage alone is the size of my friend's two backpacks combined, that staff insisted that my friend must pack everything into one backpack only. My friend had to step out, repack everything into one bulging, overflowing backpack before he is let through. The content brought through the gate doesn't change, the two backpacks were far from exceeding the luggage allowance in the first place, and the staff has created nothing more than sheer annoyance and further delay in our already delayed trip. The flight was around 50 minutes long and given the 1-hr time difference, reached London Luton airport at around 10:45pm London time. By this time, my friend and I were very anxious as we need to catch the 11:20pm bus from the airport to the train station, if we miss that bus, we will miss the last train home and will inevitably have to spend the night out in the streets. Just when everyone is getting their luggage from the cabin and gearing to leave, a flight announcement sounded saying that the bus to the gate will not be here for another ten minutes, and we were frustrated. Despite being late for an hour, the shuttle bus to the gate is still not scheduled on time! By the time the shuttle bus came, everyone got in, and we arrived at the gate, it was 11pm and we have barely 20 minutes to run to the customs, clear it, and dash to the bus stop. I have to run and dash through the crowd like a mad person, and we hopped onto the bus with only 2 minutes to spare. I don't think I will take easyjet again.

740,P Mallon,United Kingdom,2017-04-23,6,"✅ Verified Review   EasyJet flight EZY1821 on 19th April from Manchester to Antalya. Having travelled extensively for over 50 years, never have I experienced such appalling, intimidating and hostile behaviour as displayed by the crew on this flight. From the outset the passengers were threatened by the cabin steward and the intimidating behaviour continued throughout the flight.  Whilst I understand cabin crew do have occasional customer issues & pressures to deal with (as do all other customer facing roles) the majority of yesterday's passengers appeared to be middle aged, sensibly behaved golfers & regular, well mannered holiday makers. We were all initially warned that the crew had a ""list of passenger names"" who'd made purchases from Manchester airport duty-free and if anyone was suspected of drinking their own alcohol they would have their cabin baggage inspected and if found 'guilty' they would have the duty-free confiscated and face the prospect of arrest and a night in jail at their destination. An example was provided involving one recent passenger on a journey to Tenerife, and was conveyed as if this was a threat. One  does not generally get on a plane expecting to be spoken to like unruly school children or out of control persons. As far as I could see, most passengers were opened mouthed in astonishment by the attitude of the crew. The in-flight safety demonstration then commenced, but the steward paused it, and subsequently instructed us that if anyone was found to be not paying full attention to the safety demonstration the plane would be ""returning to the terminal and we'd be going nowhere"". Much as I fully understand the basis and sense behind both the above examples (there were many others) there are ways of politely conveying information to customers. I did not witness one passenger acting in anything but an adult and respectable manner and the behaviour of the crew was at best disrespectful and bombastic. I witnessed one stewardess referring loudly to one gentleman passenger (behind his back) as ""grandad"". Another male steward was openly verbally and sneeringly hostile towards a passenger, there seemed to be other disputes ongoing throughout the journey. When the cabin steward announced that in flight duty-free sales were about to commence we were all warned darkly about the dangers of consuming alcohol or tobacco purchased in Turkey as it could not be trusted and we would have no idea of the dangers of buying it anywhere but on board the flight (hardly conducive towards the currently struggling tourist economy in Turkey). We subsequently did not purchase anything from duty-free in protest to such slanderous remarks, nor did fellow passengers nearby. It was a relief to disembark, in the arrivals hall a large number of passengers were openly discussing how dreadful the crew had been and how unnecessary their hostile attitudes had been. I have never left a complaint on any social networking or internet website before, however on this occasion I feel sufficiently aggrieved to vent my dismay. I enjoy flying as a rule and have never come away from a journey feeling nervous of the crew. I sincerely hope we don't encounter this particular crew ever again.

However my stroller was not delivered to the aircraft at my destination - not an airport restriction as even Ryanair does this - I had to wait for my stroller more than people for their luggage (not easy with active toddler) - on the way back in Gatwick again I did not get the stroller and when I asked if it will be at the top of the sleeve was told it will not be available until baggage claim. That is a very long walk carring a toddler and waiting for passport control. I was told that 'maybe' i can find a yellow pushchair that i guess are used to lower the cost of service. None was available to anyone on this flight - not only me. If easyJet wants to use this system than i should have an option to prebook this chair or have enough available for all. Otherwise they cant claim they provide the service. - at the end again I had to wait until most of the luggage rolled off I fly a lot with my toddler - low cost and not - but never before I have had to endure this inconvenience.

To cut the story short the plane we finally got put on (and then sat waiting) finally reached Edinburgh after 1 am on morning of 24th Dec. This is because easyJet now juggle with planes and have too few to cover the short falls. Last night my Edinburgh plane was again delayed to Gatwick, should have been 6.55 pm and it finally got in at 9pm. One other winge is that they frequently fly you in the plane that differs from the diagram of one used to allocate tickets, twice now I have booked £10 extra for sitting in row with extra leg room over wings (Exit) and ended up in one with virtually no leg room as its a different plane.

754,A Sallidro,Italy,2017-03-11,1,"✅ Verified Review   Venice to Naples. I always travel with a hand luggage if my trips aren't longer than a week. Yesterday at the airport in Venezia (Marco Polo) they wouldn't let me pass with my hand luggage although it fits the official proportions of the company/airport, then they made me pay 60 euros for the luggage, an absurd price, I paid more for the luggage than for the flight. I always travel with the same luggage, but thanks to the person in charge from easyjet I had this problem - other passengers pointed out to me that they passed with luggage bigger than mine. So my advice is don't ever pay those 60 euros if you get in the same situation as I did, report it to the airport, do what you need to do, but don't pay that money. 10 people who came after me had to put the luggage on hold, that is to send it for free because the plane was full, so for them they could do that but I had to pay 60 euros.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Naples,March 2017,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,False,Venice,Naples,,Positive,0.8555,  verify review venice naples always travel hand luggage trip longer week yesterday airport venezia marco polo let pas hand luggage although fit official proportion make pay 60 euros luggage absurd price pay luggage always travel luggage thanks person charge problem passenger point passed luggage big mine advice ever pay 60 euro get situation report airport need pay money 10 people come put luggage hold send free full pay 60 euro

Landed at Seville and were kept on the plane for over an hour while they worked out what to do. Could not go back to Gibraltar as weather worsened. Eventually bussed back to Gibraltar which took 3 hrs and finally arrived there at 8pm instead of 11.55am. At no point were we offered a drink or food on the plane - unless we paid for it.

781,H Mander,Germany,2016-11-06,9,✅ Verified Review   The easyJet flight from Berlin-Schönefeld to Barcelona was great. The plane departed on time and the flight was better than I expected. The cabin staff was very friendly and the seats are comfortable enough. The legroom was better than legroom in other low-cost flights. I had to pay for my seat and for the food. But the focaccia I have bought for 3.5€ was hot and very delicious. Juice for 3€ was a bit expensive if you compare it with the good price of the focaccia but it was also good. The small room where I had to wait before Boarding was not comfortable because I did not have a seat for 10 minutes. Like in other low-cost or regional airlines there was no IFE but for 2.5 hours it was okay. The value for money was good but other low-cost carriers are much cheaper with the same service.,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SXF to BCN,September 2016,3.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,,4,yes,False,SXF,BCN,,Positive,0.9871,  verify review barcelona great departed time well expect cabin staff friendly seat comfortable enough legroom well legroom flight pay seat food focaccia buy hot delicious juice bit expensive compare good price focaccia good small room wait board comfortable seat 10 minute like regional ife hour okay value money good carrier much cheap service

788,Ann Lane,United Kingdom,2016-10-21,1,"✅ Verified Review   Gatwick to Chania. When my partner and I previously flew easyJet, we were crammed into tiny seats with no legroom at all, and were told we would have to pay extra to be moved up front (even though the seats were empty and the attendant could clearly see my partner, at 6'7"", was clearly far too tall for the regular seats). As a result this time we paid an additional fee for exit row seats, which included 'speedy boarding'. Firstly, there was no speedy boarding. We had the privilege of showing our tickets at the gate ahead of other passengers, only to be kept waiting in the corridor for about 20 minutes before everyone was allowed to swarm towards the plane. We were then shocked to find our so-called 'exit row' seats were almost exactly the same as regular seats, with maybe an extra inch of legroom. I shudder to think what would happen in an actual emergency, as there would certainly be very little room for passengers to swiftly evacuate the plane this way. We endured almost as much discomfort as on previous flights, and could not believe we had been made to pay for such a joke. And as with every easyJet flight, I find it ridiculous that we have to pay for hold luggage, when on every flight I have ever taken with them somebody at the gate has announced that the plane is 'too full' for everyone's cabin baggage and invited people to check theirs in.

817,Bob Weber,France,2016-08-23,1,"Frequent flyer but recently tried easyJet for first time because of the cheap last minute tickets. Huge mistake. I've never had a worse flight experience. The flight (Barcelona to Basel) was an hour late leaving the gate because of some technical breakdown. Once we started taxiing it took more than 30 min to get off the ground. Not clear why the taxi took so long but we could have driven around the entire airport several times in that time. They have luggage requirements different from all other airlines. They appear to make all of their money running this luggage con. You can only have a single piece of luggage. They don't tell you during the long wait in line either. They purposely wait until you are just about to board so you don't have time to re-arrange your luggage. If you do manage to consolidate your luggage, they are waiting and ready to throw the other shoe at you: oh that luggage is too bulky and/or heavy. They charge you 60€ to check an extra bag. It is that or miss your flight. They are not even polite about it. 6 of us got caught in exactly the same way on this flight. After that, the ticket price is no longer competitive. Adding insult to injury, the luggage bins in the cabin are huge and could easily fit luggage much larger than ours and we flew with them all half empty. Nothing free is offered in flight to eat or drink. What they do sell is grossly over priced. The last straw was at the arrival, walking up and down stairs with droves of other people down long tunnels.

818,Nick Amer,United Kingdom,2016-08-22,1,"✅ Verified Review   We arrived at Toulouse airport 11th July, to find our flight 21.50 flight to Gatwick delayed, and nothing open in the terminal, not even drinking water available. Flight eventually left at 1am next morning, so should be home shortly. Apparently previous crew had run out of flying hours so a replacement crew had to be drafted in to get us home. The plane starts to descend to land at Gatwick, wheels down and then a steep pull up, full power and we are back up, pilot then tells us that as we are so late the main runway is closed for repairs so he attempted to land on second runway but due to bad lighting and visibility he aborted landing. He was then going to circle for 15 mins while they re-opened the main runway. Next announcement was ""welcome to Stansted"". We were then told to wait on the plane while they sorted coaches for onward travel. 20 mins later were we told to make our way to arrivals for the transport home but once we were in arrivals we were then told to make our own way home (2am in the morning) and seek compensation on the EasyJet website. We eventually arrived back in Gatwick at 9am, another day off work. So far, now 22nd August, despite many calls and letters we have received no compensation, no refund of our bus fares, no explanation. EasyJet Customer Service is anything but a customer service.

824,N Dornquast,United States,2016-08-08,1,"✅ Verified Review   We booked a summer vacation to Europe - landing in Paris. We used EasyJet to book airfare from Paris-Barcelona-Paris and a week later for Paris-Napes-Paris. Trip to Barcelona was odd in that they routed us out of the terminal, onto busses, then to a plane on tarmac - similar debark in Barcelona.  Inconvenient, slow. On the return trip, an EasyJet staffer pulled us out of line, measured our bags. One bag was 1"" too long. She said only on purse or bag was allowed per passenger. We were charge 240 euros on the spot to return home. Later looking online, it is less clear about 1 bag. 1 bag/purse per passenger is general, but in many cases 1 purse and 1 carry-on bag is allowed. Very confusing.  I can embrace the concept of a low-cost carrier but be clear about what you're not offering. Not even water, soda, juice or crackers was provided. Seats do not recline. Friendly helpful service was non-existent. Staff at BCN to help with complaints did not exist either. Worse was to come. 4 hours before we were to leave for our early morning flight - we received 3am text message saying our flight was cancelled due to illness by one of the flight crew. Had I not happen to wake up and check my phone at 3:30am, we would have been totally screwed. As it was, I spent two hours in the middle of the night trying to find a last minute flight for 4 one-way tickets to Naples.  EasyJet booked the flight and return flight 1 week later. The return flight was an Air France flight. That wasn't cancelled. So, now I needed one-way tickets (expensive) and last minute (even more expensive). What did EasyJet offer in compensation? They would rebook me (at no charge) another flight to Naples or refund my purchase price for the tickets. Two issues.  Next available EasyJet flight was 5 days later (bye-bye vacation).  Value as for 1/2 round fair purchased a month ago. I will never fly EasyJet again. Wish I could rate lower than a 1. For the last kick in the pants, EasyJet also booked my rental car.

825,Michael Callow,United Kingdom,2016-08-08,2,"✅ Verified Review   I travelled from Belfast International to Malaga on 17th May of this year with Easyjet. Tried to book extra legroom but was told no seats were available so despite being 6ft 4ins tall I found myself in a middle seat between aisle and window. In normal circumstances I could endure this for a short three hour flight, however, a fate would have it the seat in front wouldn't stay in an upright position - it was in a permanent reclining position - it was broken. I asked the Stewardess if there was any remedy to this situation and she told me the plane was full but she would see what she could do, which was reasonable. She seemed to forget her promise as she never came back to me so I sat with the Lady in front practically sitting on my lap. After a couple of hours I decided to visit the toilet at the front of the plane, and saw the front three seats were totally vacant. So I sat down on one of them as there was only an hour left of the flight. The Chief Stewardess rudely asked me why I was sitting there so I told her that row 16 seat was broken. She said I would have to pay extra to sit at the front so I asked her if I would get a refund for sitting in the broken seat for the previous two hours - she said not and that I would have to return to my broken seat. As a matter of principle I refused to pay extra for the last hour of the flight and returned to Row 16. On my return home I sent a complaint to Easyjet on 29th May. I received the following response right back ""Dear easyJet Customer Thank you for contacting easyJet via our online form. We aim to reply to you within 3days, although in busy periods this may be longer. We’ll be in touch soon. Regards, easyJet Customer Services"". That was on 29th May 2016 - it is now 3rd August 2016, almost ten weeks later and I haven't heard anything more from Easyjet. Seems they must be very busy with complaints which doesn't surprise me one little bit.

831,B Mann,United Kingdom,2016-07-23,1,"✅ Verified Review   Gatwick to Edinburgh. After delays of 2 hours, which is quite good for easyjet, our gate was announced. This was where the drama started. We went to gate 55D which was the same gate the Glasgow flight which had been called earlier. After about half an hour of trying to figure out who was at gate 55D they decided to move the Edinburgh passengers. They moved us to gate 54 which was back through the check in desk. On getting there we were told we could get through. So the 100 or so passengers were trapped in a glass corridor in the blistering heat. After another half an hour they decided to move us in to what looked like a departure lounge that time forgot. Basically seats and that was it. I asked one time during the next half hour if could visit the bathroom and was told no. When an announcement finally came. The first one of the day I hasten to add the the flight was cancelled. We then had to wait about an hour until they decided to escort us out of the airport through passport control, even though we were domestic which took another half hour.

We then lost time for some unknown reason and arrived even later. When we arrived at Gatwick the pilot couldn't park the plane and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a tug to push the plane into position to enable the jetty to be attached. If I wasn't tired and hungry it would have been comical. Today boarding should have commenced 50 minutes ago, we have been left standing for 50 minutes with absolutely no explanation in the sweltering heat of the departure lounge. So it looks like my return journey will have a similar farcical delay. If you are flying the Edinburgh to Gatwick route, do yourself a favour and use British Airways. You will be surprised how similar the fares are. And for the record, I am not a British Airways employee, I am a disgruntled Easyjet customer.

836,M Christie,United States,2016-07-13,3,"✅ Verified Review   I am extremely frustrated with easyJet after our flight from Paris to Nice. Not only was this an expensive flight for a short trip in Europe but the attendants at the gate were very rude. The website says that you have to pay 60€ for an extra bag (in a subtle way), so you must know that going into it. Unfortunately, we did not know this policy until we get to the gate and they aggressively asked for our money. After traveling throughout Europe for some time, we have never had any problem with our baggage. Most airlines have allowed one small bag and one overhead bag, so while we still have all of that luggage, we have to pay for what they already have space for on their flight. Furthermore, once we had boarded the flight, we noticed ample space in all of the overhead luggage compartments for the bags while they had specifically said at the gate that due to the full flight, they could not fit our baggage. They charge you for all food and beverages as well. The policies this airline holds are frankly absurd as they try to rip you off. Definitely not worth what you pay for. They advertise themselves as a cheap airlines while instead you will probably have to pay the price of a much nicer flight.

843,O Cazacu,United Kingdom,2016-06-29,10,"✅ Verified Review   London Gatwick to Arrecife, Lanzarote. I've been flying with Easyjet for about 7 years, mostly to the Canaries. Over the years, I could see a great deal of improvement in the service, food and aircraft. To begin with, there were three toilets on the plane that took us to Lanzarote and back, all of which had baby changing stations. The food was much better this time around than on any other flight. We opted for the meal deals, and were really impressed with the Corkers crisps and the hot food. They were far tastier than any other on-flight food I've had in over 10 years of flying with state-owned and low-cost airlines. The staff was very attentive, helping me with my baggage, and making sure that I'm aware of the facilities and safety features dedicated to infants. The flight attendants forgot to serve us some of the food, and it took about 15 minutes for the hot food to be served, but that's not something we'd hold against them, considering they were genuinely busy. There was a general sense of calm and consideration for other people, with passengers willing to overlook the noise and fuss our children made, and I believe that's down to how the staff carried themselves and attended to people's needs. There was a friendly atmoshpere throughout, which helped ease our anxieties over political unrest in the country, and especially attitudes toward migrants. The new Recaro seats are very comfortable and sleek, with plenty of legroom behind and underneath.

We were told to come back the next morning for a new flight scheduled at 9.55. This flight finally departed after 13.00.

Result was a near 22 hour delay on arrival in Paris. I accept this misfortune could happen with any airline. What I do not accept is that on 15 June I am still waiting for the reimbursement of my out of pocket expenses and that EasyJet have claimed that they do not owe any compensation under European legislation as the flight was delayed due to weather conditions - that was the case for the original flight, but not for the replacement flight.

857,B Lawson,United States,2016-06-06,1,"✅ Verified Review   Flew Gatwick to Jersey. Let’s face it, Easyjet treats their customers like cattle. We boarded the flight which was to be one hour in duration. The flight actually boarded on time and without incident. When everyone was boarded the captain came on to say that the flight was to be delayed because of weather in Jersey. He said it was going to be delayed an hour to start but could be delayed as much as four hours before the flight left. So here was a full flight, in an uncomfortable airplane with children and families on board that was going to just sit. What upsets me here is that the crew knew about this potential delay prior to boarding and still put everyone on the plane. The plane did finally leave, 5 hours later. The passengers were forced to sit on the hot plane with no air, no food, no drinks, for 5 hours. Once the flight left it was a one hour ride to Jersey.",A320,Business,Economy Class,LGW to JER,May 2016,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,,3,no,False,LGW,JER,,Negative,-0.8316,  verify review fly gatwick jersey let face treat customer like cattle board one hour duration actually board time without incident everyone board captain come say delay weather jersey say go delay hour start delay much four hour leave full uncomfortable airplane child family board go sit upset crew knew potential delay prior board still put everyone finally leave 5 hour later passenger force sit hot air food drink 5 hour leave one hour ride jersey

866,A Murphy,United Kingdom,2016-05-24,3,"Manchester to Venice. Due to problem with plane the easyjet Manchester departure was slightly delayed and some passengers could not fly as the plane that was substituted was smaller. We did get on the flight but all our seats were changed, for a short flight and being older children this was not a huge issue but we had paid for allocated seating and it took several unanswered emails and eventually a long and no doubt costly call to Easyjet to try to claim the payment back. They tried to offer me free seat allocation on the next flight, as I'm hoping never to have to use this airline again I politely refused and was told a refund would be given in 5-10 days - time will tell! Return trip was delayed but no announcement made or info given, when finally boarded in Venice the cabin staff were to say the least brusque, we were seated at very back of flight and of course no room was left for baggage, rather than try to help by checking overheads at the front of the plane a staff member thought it appropriate to just shout at my daughters to sit down, when she explained she had no where to put her baggage and could not ""go against the tide"" of still boarding passengers to check the front she was told she would just have to put it in the hold, how this was going to be managed by my daughter was not mentioned and clearly the staff were not going to help - eventually another staff member did find some space and called my daughter down from her seat at the back to the front to store her baggage - not a major issue but overall the experience is one of lack of care, whilst safety should always be paramount they seem disorganised at best and uncaring at worst, helping a passenger could actually save them time in the long run and when they are obviously running late and working against a tight time frame you would think that experience would of taught them this - the whole customer service ethos has passed them by and I got the impression on both flights that passengers were very much a necessary evil and the cabin crews life would be so much better if they just didn't have to deal with them.

After a few passengers left, we got yet another call from the cockpit informing us that we will not be landing in Paris, but in Milan to refuel.  In a matter of minutes we were airborne. Its worth mentioning that the cabin crew had the decency to offer complimentary beverages and snacks to make up for the inconvenience. The food was average, simple meals most of which are sandwiches that I do enjoy. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable. The distance between the seats was insufficient lacking legroom which made the flight uncomfortable.

879,Nizar Habib,Israel,2016-04-15,4,"I'll start by saying that the price is fair, we paid around 400 euros each for a flight from Tel Aviv to London which is quite a distance. The cabin crew were polite and decent but they still have to start acknowledging their own rules. They have a rule for carryon luggage 56x45x26cm, why can't they stick to that? Everyone got on the flight with massive bags that were obviously not fit to be carried on and then had to remove the luggage from the plane. Another thing that is annoying is the non-existant entertainment system. We had a family infront of us that had ipads and laptops with them.

908,Veronica Nolan ,United Kingdom,2016-02-23,6,"I didn't expect much as it was the 2nd time I flew with easyjet. The first was in 1997. It hasn't improved much in terms of Customer Service. I have avoided it this long but it was inevitable this time around as I wasn't paying for the trip myself so I had budget constrain. Flew from London Gatwick to Lisbon. Let's start with the booking process. This was easy and straightforward, living up to its name. However, the additional charges for bags and seats (although I knew about it) still irked me. It really should be standard. How can any airline charge their customers for choosing where to sit? Afterall, we are already paying to fly. The bags - less said. Anyway, the London Gatwick experience was so-so. If you're not an easyJet Plus customer you can't bring anything else apart from one cabin bag-not even a small handbag. I think this is just ridiculous. A handbag is like a 5th limb for most people. Having said that, when returning, the staff at the boarding gate in Lisbon terminal 2 (budget airlines only terminal), allowed the passenger in front of me to carry her handbag which was almost as big as her cabin bag. She wasn't an easyJet Plus customer as those who were went through another lane. She was told to queue like we all were. This inconsistency is what lets easyJet down. I have to say, their pilots on both leg of the journey were brilliant. High winds, but not a bump when landing. The bag drop process in Gatwick was smooth. The one in Lisbon was so-so (might have to do with it being a budget terminal). Calling you to the gate 45 minutes before departure and then to go through passport control was a very silly set-up. It meant everyone was anxious and rushing and in a bad mood. But that's the termnal's fault. Easyjet - if I have the means, I would never fly it.

914,C Healy,United Kingdom,2016-02-08,5,"I was travelling easyJet from Madrid to Edinburgh to attend a wedding reception straight from the flight, so was carrying only 1 carry on trolley case (within required dimensions). I queued up very early (only a few passengers in front of me) to ensure I got onboard fastly and I could put my bag in. When I reached the door of the plane the ground staff tried to snatch the bag from me but I asked why as the overhead lockers were empty - I explained I was going straight to a wedding reception and that my dress was at the top of my case ironed and ready to put on and this is why I had a seat and the front of the plane and queued early - they were kind and understood and told me to speak to the crew. I then encountered a very smug crew who didn't want to know about my need or wouldn't explain why my bag was being offloaded when it was still empty - he said it was a full flight but surely it's first come first served for baggage space? To which he sang with a big smile on his face ""you have agreed to the terms and conditions when you bought the ticket, so if you don't like it please leave!"" I was in shock of this and had to ask again to make sure I heard right - asking me to leave because I had asked why I couldn't put it there when it was empty - absolutely no empathy or warmth and seemed to take pleasure from it and made eyes with another crew. He then instructed them to remove my bag and wasn't asked if I needed to take anything from it - I later realised I was left without money or my motion sickness medication and didn't feel comfortable to ask if my bag could be retrieved due to the unapproachable crew - this made the flight miserable.

917,P G Driscoll,United Kingdom,2016-01-27,6,"Flew out on the 21st from London Gatwick to Montpellier with easyJet - a few of us flew out for a rugby game. My companion and I had booked separately and I had selected seats and chose to take cabin baggage only. Both our bags were hard cases of less than regulation size. We arrived at the gate to be told that our bags would have to be checked in (no charge) a bit annoying but not really a problem. We took our seats having noticed the lockers crammed full with cases which in no way were regulation size or less. Again annoying but not worth making a fuss over. Then, we were informed that due to the baggage conveyor going wrong, all the hold bags had to be moved manually so a delay was inevitable. This is when the hard seat with my knees under my chin became an issue. For the 1.5 hour flight I was prepared to suffer but the extra hour made it a bit torturous. Coming back on the 25th, the flight was overbooked and again, people were asked to put luggage in the hold. We kept our cases as I suspect the reclaim at Gatwick would have been a much longer wait than at Montpellier which was very quick. The queuing system at the gate was a bit farcical and disorderly. Because we had no priority boarding, it was difficult to find anywhere for our cases due again, in no uncertain way to the lockers being overstuffed with oversize luggage. The cabin staff were very helpful and fitted our bags in further down the cabin. I felt sorry for the staff having to put up with quite a few unpleasant comments from other travellers.

918,R Mercer,Spain,2016-01-26,3,"During my recent flight from Spain, where I live, to Gatwick for the weekend I experienced appalling treatment at the hands of Easyjet staff. As we were about to board the plane we were asked to demonstrate that our bag would fit in the cage. This was an irritating request seeing as we had flown with the bag a dozen times, but nonetheless one I acceded to in good humour, courtesy and without protest. In the interests of saving time I placed the bag in the cage, but did not push it all the way down. The first two wheels glided in seamlessly, but the last two wheels were left protruding out of the cage by about 1 inch, but only as I had not pushed the bag down as it should have been obvious it fitted. The Easyjet employee simply stated ""right, it doesn’t fit it will have to be checked in"". There was no attempt to be helpful and suggest I get the last two wheels in and no application of common sense that dictated that if the first two wheels fitted, then the last two logically also must. It was not said with even a modicum of courtesy and she walked away from me while she was talking. I went back to the desk where she rudely informed me I had to pay £45 for it to be checked in. Understandably shocked and frustrated at my appalling public treatment I refused, to which she replied ""well you won’t be flying then"". I was utterly flabbergasted at how brusquely I was being spoken to. At this point she directed me, again curtly, to her manager. Her manager displayed a similar lack of professionalism and contempt for us, talking to me as though I were an errant child that should have known better. I pointed out that we had flown out on Friday with the bag, to which she responded that she didn’t know if I really did as I may have checked it in, the logical inference being I was lying. I pointed out that she could look up my flight records and see that I had not checked in any luggage, to which she responded that I might have swapped the bag while in the UK over the weekend. The stupidity of this statement needs no explanation. She reiterated that I would not be flying if we refused to pay. I suggested there was an issue with Easyjet staff training seeing as I had flown with the bag a dozen times and never experienced any problems, to which she contemptuously explained to me that her staff were excellently trained in these matters. At this point both my girlfriend and I were exhausted with the ridiculousness of it all. My girlfriend offered to demonstrate to the manager that the bag did fit, which the manager flippantly accepted, clearly certain that her ""well trained"" staff couldn’t possibly have made an error. The bag went all the way into the cage and the manager’s response was simply ""ok, yes it can go in with you"". We received no apology. She simply walked off and carried on with her work. I even had to ask for our passports back. I would also like to point out that on the flight out we were told there was no room in the overhead bins (there was) and we had to check it in. Perhaps I should have charged Easyjet £45 for doing so. Is this really the level of professionalism and customer service I can expect from Easyjet? This is easily the most appalling treatment I have received as a customer.

I flew with hand luggage plus a backpack from Stuttgart to London without problem. On my return flight, apparently this was a problem. I was told at the gate I needed to check my hand luggage and bring my backpack on board. Normally I'd store the hand luggage in the above compartment and the backpack underneath. I reluctantly paid £45 to have the privilege of checking my bag. I then boarded the plane, stored my backpack in the above compartment only to be told that backpacks are only stored under the seat.

933,Neil Greenlees,United Kingdom,2016-01-04,5,"easyJet from Manchester to Belfast. I don't ask for much on short flights of this nature apart from a reasonably on time departure and arrival, so I am rarely moved to write a review. However, on this occasion I think the attitude of the young man in charge of the cabin left a lot to be desired. We were sitting in an aisle and middle seat on row two, Once everyone was on board, I noticed none of the front row seats were occupied so I asked if we could move forward one row to allow my wife to have a window seat. The young man said no because we would have to pay an ""upfront fee"" to do so. However, we already had easyJet plus because we had reserved row two seats. Okay, he was sticking strictly to the rules but it seemed a bit mean when no-one else was sitting there. However, there was no excuse for this easyJet flight attendant actually shouting from his seat at a passenger sitting behind me. There appeared to be some confusion over whether the passenger was using a child seatbelt properly. At this stage the aircraft was still above the clouds, the undercarriage had not been lowered and the pilot had not given cabin crew the warning that landing was imminent. There was therefore no reason why he could not have left his seat and spoken to the passenger in a polite manner. Instead, he yelled: ""Excuse me Sir"" at the top of his voice before the young lady sitting beside him nudged him and pointed out the seatbelt was, in fact, properly activated. There was no apology. They simply resumed their conversation about Christmas gifts they had received.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,MAN to BFS,December 2015,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,,4,yes,False,MAN,BFS,,Positive,0.6597,  manchester belfast ask much short flight nature apart reasonably time departure arrival rarely move write review however occasion think attitude young man charge cabin leave lot desire sit aisle middle seat row two everyone board notice none front row seat occupy ask move forward one row allow wife window seat young man say pay upfront fee however already plus reserved row two seat okay stick strictly rule seem bit mean else sit however excuse attendant actually shout seat passenger sit behind appeared confusion whether passenger use child seatbelt properly stage still cloud undercarriage lower pilot give cabin crew warn land imminent therefore reason leave seat speak passenger polite manner instead yell excuse sir top voice young lady sit beside nudge point seatbelt fact properly activate apology simply resume conversation christmas gift receive

When we arrived at the airport we asked for a wheelchair it never arrived. He walked from terminal 1-3. We queued to book in, again asked for a wheelchair. They told my parents to sit and wait and a wheelchair would arrive. They told us the rest of our group had to carry on through passport control leaving my father with my mother to wait for the chair. They never checked on them to see and the wheelchair never arrived. My dad then had to walk through security and a 15 min walk to the boarding area.  When they arrived in the boarding lounge they told us what had happened. Dad sat down on one of the chairs and a staff tripped over his bad leg. She only turned around when my mum lept to try and cover his bad leg. She didn't stop to see if he was okay. I asked another staff if he could have assistance from the boarding lounge to the plane - she said she had to see his boarding pass, checked it and said it's not written on his boarding pass. She begrudgingly let him go to the front of the queue. A very disappointing journey that could have easily been different if any of the staff had taken time to deal with the situation properly.

Then it all turned pear shaped. The Captain told us there would be a maximum delay of 1hr 10mins because of computer issues at Brest air traffic control. We finally set off 1.5 hrs later with no further warnings or explanations. We had paid for extra leg room seats, but were not warned that for the person sitting nearest the window in row 1 (the only extra leg room seats) was limited by the slide stowage, so it was only okay if you had no left leg! The seats were like church pews, upright and uncomfortable and to add to our misery they did not recline even one notch! This despite the stewardess telling us at each take off and landing that we must ensure our seats are upright! After about 1.5hrs the feeling in our legs was replaced by the pain of biting cold. We were told no blankets could be supplied because it is a budget airline and people steal them and anyway we should know and bring our own. Cabin service was curt to the point of rudeness, rather than efficient. The descent into Funchal was extremely turbulent we experienced a ""missed approach"" due to the cross winds being outside the aircraft's limits. We briefly joined a holding pattern, but were diverted to Gran Canaria. We were later told this was because there was insufficient fuel to wait and make a second attempt. As it was now nearly six hours since we last ate, we asked for some food. We were told they could not serve hot food now and anyway all the food would have gone off and not be fit to eat! Instead they handed out complementary pringles/crisps and plastic cups of water! After at least an hour, the pilot decided to return to Funchal make another attempt to land. If that failed he would take us to ""mainland Europe."" The descent was much smoother and the landing was achieved. We finally landed 5 hrs after our allotted time at 12.20am! It was a relief to disembark after 9hrs on the aircraft. Fortunately, our car hire had stayed open for our flight, so we were able to get ourselves to a hotel and find a room for the night, as it was now too late to pick up the key to the apartment we were renting. We have since discovered that earlier flights by other airlines took their passengers to other islands and paid for overnight accommodation. Easyjet made no attempt to even make sure we were able to find and get to accommodation at that late hour - there being no taxis at the airport! Whilst the circumstances were not all the fault of Easyjet, and, indeed, we had expected problems with the landing, this airline made a bad situation many times worse by their appalling attitude and shoddy service.

However my most recent experience, a return journey between Gatwick and Edinburgh, left a bad taste in my mouth regarding boarding. At LGW, one check-in assistant was telling all women they couldn't take both a handbag and a trolleybag into the cabin, causing a scrum at the gate while dozens of female passengers frantically tried to squash their bags inside their suitcases. The other check-in assistant wasn't remotely bothered however, and as I was in her queue, I sailed through with both my bag and case. Having a bit of time to kill at EDI coming back, I noticed that easyJet have a strange policy of asking passengers on almost every departing flight to volunteer to put their cabin baggage into the hold. Towards the end of the boarding queue, this no longer becomes voluntary, as happened to my two travelling companions who were told their bags would be tagged and taken away from them on the tarmac. This is infuriating if you have had liquids confiscated at security, for example, or have a tight onward connection to make. If the aircraft isn't big enough to accommodate hand luggage for every passenger then easyJet need to revise their policy, making checked luggage much more affordable (or free) rather than wasting boarding time by taking people's bags off them.

Everyone on that now started to run down the corridor in fear that they would not make the flight. My elderly parents were flying with me and my mother is asthmatic so she cannot run or even walk quickly.

We were notified the day before our flight from Santorini to Manchester,  that the flight had been cancelled. After a lot of messing about and little support from Easyjet. We got a flight a day later to London Gatwick. We incurred significant cost getting back to Manchester and submitted our receipts to easyJet to claim compensation. We flew to Gatwick on the 6th August - it is now the 25th of September and they have still not settled our claim even though I had to pay the extra travel cost almost 2 months ago. What is most annoying is that when we were in Santorini trying to contact easyJet to see what our options were - you could not get through to customer services (we were on hold for over an hour!). I have called them since my return 5 times (the average hold time is over 30 minutes) and although they promise to sort this out and say a manager will call back, they lie - they don't sort it out and don't call back. As a travel editor I regularly use low cost airlines - Jet2, Ryanair etc. and I have to say the lack of customer service make easyJet the worst I have come across. I will certainly never use them again. You can't trust easyJet to be there for you and to sort out problems.

985,Julie Berry,United Kingdom,2015-09-25,1,"We were stranded in Portugal for 5 nights due to the French Air traffic control strike this April. Yes we were put in a 5 star hotel but there was no proper advice given. People were encouraged to fly to an airport, in some cases hundreds of miles from home, with no clear promise of payments. I had serious doubts that easyJet would pay up. To this day they have promised to look at my out of pocket expenses, but they do not answer the phone and if you email them you get an automated response but no real reply.

986,Dan Ross,United Kingdom,2015-09-20,3,"easyJet is not a cheap airline if you don't book when the ""headline"" fares go on sale or when they run one of their fare sales. Because it was an early morning flight we had to book a hotel nearby. The one plus is being able to check in your bag the night before to save time in the morning. The staff doing that told us to hurry as she was about to go off shift and we would have had to wait for her replacement to arrive! Next morning we did just breeze through however. We were in the South terminal. What a horrible terminal. The only upside was we had a gate were we actually boarded using a plane bridge instead of the stairs! Onboard the crew were very nice and the plane clean and tidy. I find their on board menu options overpriced and they never seem to have the items I want anyway! The flight to Paphos is over 4 hours and easyJet seats don't recline (even though they tell you make sure your seat is in the upright position) and there is no head rest support. easyJet planes are like sitting on a park bench. Nice for a little while, but eventually you want to move on. But you can't. The whole plane got fidgety because they were so uncomfortable.

The return flight was delayed but my wife and I were impressed by the way staff handled the delay. A problem with the hydraulics had been discovered on the outward flight and this needed repair. The captain explained and kept us informed of progress. The repair meant no air conditioning for a time, but aircraft doors and the flight deck windows were left open and passengers who needed air were allowed to stand by the doors. Everyone was offered water.  We eventually left over an hour late but made up a little time en route. We hadn't been comfortable waiting on a hot plane, but there was no fuss because we knew why.
