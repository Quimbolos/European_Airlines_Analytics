0,L Geronia,Australia,2023-11-14,1,"Terrible airline with horrible online customer service. My flight from Milan to Prague itself was fine, but it was the issue I encountered a week beforehand which will be the reason I would never fly with Easyjet ever again. I was forced to cancel my flight from Naples to Athens due to an injury I sustained whilst on my European vacation. This flight was not refunded to me despite having purchased their travel insurance they offer when buying plane tickets on their website. When I made the claim they informed me that in the fine print of their terms and conditions, this travel insurance is only valid for Italian citizens. So essentially they sold me a service that they knew would not be valid if claimed by any international travellers. This sort of deceptive business tactics shows nothing less of the poor ethics this company has towards its customers.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Prague,July 2023,,,,,,,1,no,True,Milan,Prague,

I told her it’s too expensive so she advised to look online and book another flight. So that’s what I did since it was cheaper and better timing.

Arrived early. Crew seemed upbeat and friendly. Return flight from Faro to Glasgow 28/10/23 was a different story. Faro was a disaster. Check in/baggage drop was at the very far end of the check in desks and was queued out the door. 1 person manning the desk. Eventually someone else appeared then the check in changed to Glasgow and Belfast with just 2 people manning it. The queue by this stage was crazy. Eventually they opened up more desks but took nearly an hour to drop off bags. Next was security, queued out again with only a few channels open. Took a further 25 mins to get through this. Then passport control, once again queued out with only a couple of desks open. I suspect had our hotel transfer not been early we could have easily missed the flight as we only ha a short time after arriving at the gate before boarding started.

4,B James,United Kingdom,2023-11-01,1,"During flight EZY8035, the 16.35 from Gatwick to Tenerife South on 18th July 2023, the seat (about 13c) of my son was given to another passenger. My son is a full-fare paying passenger (although less than 16 so I am writing this on their behalf). After boarding and takeoff as normal, the seat was momentarily vacated. A passenger in the same row lay down and started to occupy the seat. Neither my son nor I were asked for consent or even informed of this action. All I could tell was a passenger who looked as though they were recovering from a heavy night and wanted a lie down to recover. To enable this, my son had to sacrifice their seat for an indefinite length of time. I raised my issue with the aircrew. My concern was passed between two cabin crew and escalated to their superior. I was told that as I'd momentarily vacated, I had to maintain this status quo and sacrifice my son's seat. No alternative was offered. No timeframe was given. The only option I was presented was for both my son and I to squeeze into the same seat. It transpired the situation lasted for the majority of the flight. The FAA states ""The safest place for your child ... is not in your lap"". Yet this is the situation I found myself in and had to try to explain to my son. When I escalated my concerns, the best the senior cabin crew could offer was advice I should write to customer services and request a refund for my son's seat. I followed this advice.

5,Peter Meikle,United Kingdom,2023-10-03,5,"A very mixed bag. As a party of 4 we each booked and paid for 15kg hold luggage, before departure, I received an email saying we had 23kg. 3 of us had about 10kg and one went for 23kg. bag drop at Bristol was exemplary, machines worked well and helpful staff on standby to assist - no mention of extra fee. Bordeaux departure was mess, it says Billi L on the boarding pass, but who would know that that meant a shed at the end of the main terminal that was for low cost airlines - all the Departures signage coming from the hire car drop zone is to the main terminal in the opposite direction. At bag drop there was initially only 1 person sitting at a desk who was more interested in talking to colleagues rather than check in passengers' luggage. Then 2 more arrived and a panic to pull forward passengers travelling to Palma and Marseilles. The last member of our party was charged 45 euros for excess baggage despite having the same baggage as on the outbound flight. The rest of the boarding procedure was an equally overcrowded, hot and unpleasant experience. Why not use the main terminal, especially now it is about empty following France's partial domestic flight ban. Low visibility at Bristol resulted in an aborted landing followed by diversion to Cardiff. The crew were excellent, they kept us informed throughout, the captain stood at the front of the cabin and gave updates directly.

6,P Galleno,United States,2023-09-30,1,"I have flown with easyJet several times in previous years, but this time I had the unfortunate experience of learning about their handling of flight cancellations. First, I should note that the easyJet terminal at Schipol Airport is separate from all other airlines and has inadequate seating and very limited services. My flight from Amsterdam to Naples was canceled about 30 mins before the departure time, without any prior notice whatsoever that there might be any problems. There were no easyJet staff available to explain what to do. Asking other passengers with previous experience of easyJet cancellations was the only option. I went to the easyJet desk in the baggage claim area but the staff did nothing to help the stranded passengers. Recovering my checked package took 2 hours. After a long delay, the easyJet app offered the option to rebook on another flight, but in fact there were no other flights to Naples, Rome or Milan during the following two days.

7,N Abbot ,United Kingdom,2023-09-25,3,"Pretty poor performance by easyJet at their “focus city” of Naples. Whilst bag-drop was straightforward and easy, getting through passport control was a total nightmare. At least a couple of hundred passengers were trying to reach the immigration booths at the B gates but were prevented by doing so by temporary barriers erected ostensibly to control the crowds but which instead resulted in passengers being kettled and trapped in scary conditions (i.e. risk of being crushed and little to no working air conditioning). One could argue this is the airport’s responsibility rather than the airlines’, but both Ryanair and jet2 sent their staff to the barriers to allow ONLY their passengers past the barriers; easyJet passengers were not allowed through and had to wait for other airline passengers to pass through and then slip through behind them whenever they could. EasyJet did not send down any staff to advocate for their passengers stuck behind the barriers and it was the most chaotic crowd I have ever seen waiting to be stamped out of any country. As a result, our flight was delayed by one hour simply because half of the passengers were still waiting to clear passport control (I overheard one of the ground staff confirm this to the cabin crew after I had been able to finally board). The flight itself was fine, but the experience at Naples airport was harrowing and it was upsetting to see how other low cost airlines bothered to get their passengers passed the barrier whilst easyJet staff were nowhere to be seen.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Naples to London Gatwick,September 2023,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,,4,no,True,Naples,London Gatwick,

First, buying a ticket is full of pop ups and weird advertising jumping in your way; glitches and more glitches; their boarding is always last minute; at the entry in the lounge you see the fed up, grumpy, not well-mannered staff; the staff always try to find something on you to charge you extra. On my last trip there's this staff member in LGW, not very presentable, checking the boarding passes - he asked many travellers to insert their baggage in a tiny space to verify the measurements; if it was half an inch bigger than that, then he tells the travellers that would be £48 extra charge.  The only pleasurable person so far was the pilot, could see and hear his positiveness; he was assisting a little the staff in the flight to do their duties; then he apologised to us that he cannot do that anymore as he's got a plane to fly.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Isle of Man,September 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Gatwick,Isle of Man,

Afterwards I received a confirmation email saying the flight departs in Prague and flies to Milan. After I saw that email I immediately called EasyJet's customer service which was more useless. First he told me that there are no flights from Berlin to Milan at all and that I cannot change my flights at all. When I advised him that the airport is called Milan LIN that EasyJet planes fly to from Berlin, he told me that it would be cheaper for me to just make a new booking as it would be cheaper. However, I would still have to pay for those wrong flights from and to Prague since the booking has been made more than 24 hours ago. I asked him if there are any exceptions because obviously there must be a mistake (and it's possible that this mistake was made by the airline, because why would I book a flight from Prague) but he told me there's nothing that he can do for me. I went online and changed the flights on the website myself. There is no option to change both flights (there and return) at the same time, so I had to pay rebooking fees twice. Moreover there were no suitable return flights available anymore that leave in the evening, so now I had to take one a day later and have to pay for another night at the hotel. All in total I've paid now close to $900 AUD for flights + extra night at the hotel in Milan for one short trip from Berlin to Milan and return, because most likely there is some sort of bug in the system (either skyscanner or easyjet). This is more than frustrating! I would have expected EasyJet to show some understanding for my situation and either let me cancel the wrong booking to find another airline that offers me the right flights at the right times or let me change the flights at no extra fees.",,Business,Economy Class,Prague to Milan,September 2023,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Prague,Milan,

Boarding was via stairs and those allocated to board at the rear of the plane boarded as normal whereas those allocated to board via the front stairs were made to queue for around 15 to 20 minutes, standing on the tarmac. Later I discovered by chance that this was to allow a disabled passenger to be loaded first. This is understandable (and I don't mind waiting for that reason) but the failing of easyJet was that they did not communicate this reason to us whilst we were standing in the queue, not knowing what was going on.

At one point it seemed as if we might be 4 hours delayed but in the end we were less than 90 minutes delayed, which was good considering how many other hundreds of flights were cancelled and thousands delayed. We were told to check-in at the usual time; there was no queue at the airport for baggage drop. Staff were friendly, though no explicit mention was made of the likely delays! Boarding was a little chaotic as it required buses to transport everyone from the terminal to the aircraft (so anyone with speedy boarding would have only have had a marginal advantage, if any).

23,D Andrews,United Kingdom,2023-07-21,1,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and sheer frustration with the appalling service I experienced during my recent flight with EasyJet on 20th July 2023. My journey with your airline, on Flight EZY8312 from Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick, was an absolute nightmare from the very outset. To begin with, all the electronic check-in gates at Milan Malpensa Airport were either out of order or deliberately switched off, resulting in an infuriatingly slow and chaotic process. It was quite an ordeal to witness the incompetence of the ground staff, and to add to the misery, there was only one overwhelmed lady dealing with the needs of over three hundred passengers. It is beyond comprehension how an airline of EasyJet's stature could allow such a woefully understaffed situation to occur. Unfortunately, the frustration did not stop there. Upon reaching the departure gate, I was greeted with the distressing sight of an obviously intoxicated and vulgar man causing a commotion at the bar. It was abundantly clear to anyone with basic judgment that this individual was in no condition to fly. He then proceeded to wander around the terminal, rudely interacting with both staff and passengers, while attempting to light a cigarette. The potential safety risk he posed to everyone on the flight was glaringly evident, and I was utterly shocked to witness the inaction of the EasyJet staff in preventing him from boarding the plane. As time passed, the intoxicated passenger's behavior grew increasingly aggressive towards anyone who dared to approach him. Astonishingly, the gate staff checked him in without any regard for the safety of the other passengers, allowing him to board the plane despite the obvious risk he presented. I was among the last passengers to board, and the atmosphere on the plane was one of fear and discomfort as this individual continued to disrupt and behave aggressively throughout the flight. Only after an excruciating two-hour delay and numerous complaints from concerned passengers did the decision to call the police to remove the intoxicated man from the flight finally come about. This delay was further compounded by the lack of clear communication from your staff. Even the pilot expressed disbelief at how this man was allowed to board the plane in his inebriated state. The incident not only caused unnecessary distress to passengers but also created an unprofessional and unsafe environment that is wholly unacceptable. The apparent indifference of your staff towards the welfare of your customers and their failure to act promptly in such a dangerously evident situation is deeply reprehensible.",,Business,Economy Class,Milan to Gatwick,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Milan,Gatwick,

During this time we checked other flights and easyjet had nothing till 3 days later that was a 12 hour flight so we booked wizz air to fly the next day, After spending 90 minutes on hold and finally getting through to the most unhelpful employee they must of had in the department I asked them where I send this bill from the new flights to which was £639, I was then told we was not entitled to any compensation not even for our troubles. I just want to add all other airlines were flying out of Gatwick no problems so this was clearly an easyjet issue. This is a 2nd class airline with under trained staff that only care about taking your money, we normally always fly with these and there are always delays but we normally make it to our destination, but as of today we won't be using them ever again.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Larnaca,July 2023,,,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Gatwick,Larnaca,
30,Michael Kelly,United Kingdom,2023-07-02,1,"This airline is a complete shambles! We arrived at the airport, our flight was delayed for 30 mins, We then boarded the plane, when we were all seated the captain mentioned there would be a short delay, due to the tyre needing looked at (which we now know this was just the excuse for not having enough staff for our flight). We sat in the plane for another hour then the captain came back with the real reason why we hadn't moved - we are waiting on new cabin crew coming to the plane and we can't find them! They're in the airport somewhere so please bear with us! Really professional.  After 3 hours of sitting on the plane we were then informed that they have found the cabin crew. Cabin crew entered the plane to applause from everyone, however this little bit of joy was not too last. After 5 hours we taxied getting ready for take off then the plane engines stopped and we were informed that our flight was being cancelled! We were then taken from the plane and led through everyone that were awaiting to board other flights like refugees it was embarrassing, when we got to the Swiss port info desk we were then told that easyjet do not have an information desk at the airport anymore, so there was no easyjet rep to explain anything! We were then led to the luggage retrieval belt to wait on our luggage which took a further 2 hours to come out, whilst waiting I noticed young children crying and elderly people so tired and stressed out lying in corners deflated. We were informed by the easyjet app that our whole holiday had been cancelled and we can apply for a full refund (which I'm still awaiting on) and we could claim for compensation. This is were the plot thickens. We got home after 12 hours of stress the next morning I filled in a claim for compensation only to be told a day later that we our not entitled to any because the plane was grounded due to damage on the tyre! Well if that was the case why leave us on damaged plane for 5 hours? This is easyjets legal loophole to get away without paying out compensation claims. I sincerely hope they go bust because in my opinion this company are just about greed, making as much money as they possibly can without a thought of the stress and anxiety that they put hard working families that have promised their kids a great holiday only to have that dream shattered.

33,Claire Whitaker,United Kingdom,2023-06-25,1,"easyJet left us stranded abroad twice with no money, food, clothing, hotel or way home. They turned off all methods of communication, didn’t answer phone lines and put the phone down on customers. They have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back, which they will then deny. They have cost us thousands and haven’t been in touch with us at all. They’ve even blocked our social media comments.  We were supposed to return to the U.K. on the 23rd from Croatia, and so we headed to the airport for our flight from Split to Manchester. We sat for hours in the airport, and noted delay after delay. During the delays, we received no updates from staff, only learning of delays from the easyJet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water. It’s suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay, but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway. Duty free was incredibly expensive and limited, as were the facilities. We sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication, easyJet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance. The flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement. You were left to rebook the flights through the EJ app; there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available, paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket. The next direct flights weren’t for days, and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across Europe (Amsterdam, Milan, Rome) etc and not only were they with huge layovers, there were not enough seats on any of them, and also experienced the problem of being during the following days. Our smaller group had taken the Croatia to Milan connecting flight option, as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the U.K. earlier. We were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the U.K and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise, rather than days, so we were left with little choice. As there was no contact from easyJet and the staff were unhelpful, we also had to find a hotel at 11:30pm at night and then also find a way to get to it. Due to the timings, we had no food or water, and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us, we had to keep our morning flight to Milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies. We did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed, and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyJet to resolve first, so they cannot and would not help. We went through the airport as normal the next day, and boarded our flight. We were told our flight was full, and therefore only 4 of us out of our group of 8 managed to make it on this flight.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Split to Manchester,June 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Split,Manchester,

38,Diogo Freitas,Portugal,2023-06-12,1,"Flight EJU7628 FNC-LIS was originally scheduled to leave at 22:00 on 02.06.2023 but was considerably delayed until 00:00 on 03.06.2023. The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the ""delay"" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023. This makes a minimum total of €562.99, which I will never give up.

39,Manuela Monacelli,United Kingdom,2023-06-07,1,"If you want to travel to EU from London, I'd suggest you use any other company. I flew to Naples on the 3/06/23. The flight landed in a different airport from what it should have been - we were informed halfway through the flight that we had missed NAP closing time by 6 minutes, and had to land in Milan (800km away) instead. Surely, EasyJet would have checked with Naples airport that we were ok to land at the ETA to authorise departure. I'm sure that, where there's a risk of missing closing time by 6 mins as we were told, the considerate & reasonable thing to do would be to cancel the flight. I have reasons to believe that this was not done so that the incident could be marked as ""exceptional circumstances"", so that EasyJet could get away with not refunding passengers as per its refund policy. So either the staff was so naïve as to not consider that flights can miss closing time by 6 mins, or this was deliberate fraudulent behaviour. Either way, it was unacceptable. EasyJet kept us waiting 5 hours at the airport, before boarding us and only then diverting our plane. We were also promised that EasyJet would provide accommodation and alternative transport, only to find out after 2 hours' wait that no, this would not be provided and we would have to think for ourselves. I was going to Naples to attend a wedding, which I missed. I cannot think of anything that would repay me not only of the financial cost, but also the time waste (the whole trip took me 21 h), and the psychological stress the company has deliberately inflicted on me.

53,G Maneil,United Kingdom,2023-05-01,1,"I am writing to denounce my profound regret regarding my flights with easyJet. Customers try to choose EasyJet because they are low costs but the hidden fees and the staff behaviour made me spend with easyJet really more than other airlines such as Air France or Lufthansa. I think that easyJet has many problems including the fact that a flight can only be changed for an important cost (£49) when it is within two months (who will book and change a flight before two months?). Hence the change would represent twice the price of the flight price. However, I am writing regarding a specific issue. Yesterday, I had two flights with easyJet, the first from Lyon to London Luton and the second from London Luton to Edinburgh. Three days before my flight I bought the right to have a large cabin bag (that cost me £47 for the first flight and £15 for the second one). Everything was OK with the first flight where I had my cabin bag with me in the cabin (where its place should be). However, in London Luton, the staff member at the check-in desk forced me to pay 48 additional pounds for the same cabin bag with a 10.9kg weight (in order to check it in as hold luggage). Please note that the same bag fitted really well on the plane for the first flight (from Lyon to London Luton). Moreover, I observed that other passengers had cabin bags larger than mine. Hence, today I observed that easyJet staff are not coherent in imposing additional fees to customers from one country to another. Also, they are not treating their customers in the same manner. I initially paid around £22 for this flight. In the end, it cost me £85: £22 (initial payment) + £15 (Large cabin bag ) + £48 (when they forced me to check in the large cabin bag that was supposed to come with me in the cabin) In addition to this, you can read on the news every day about the high rate of delays and cancellations of this airline. Don't underestimate the stress that can be caused by this airline. Also, it has plenty of other low costs around that do not have such bad reviews from customers.

73,Leslie Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2023-01-25,10,"It's several years since we have flown with any other airline but easyJet, which I think speaks for itself. We have in the past used Ryanair occasionally but once they started seating couples separately if they did not pay for seats we ceased to do so. EasyJet suits us perfectly and flies to the places we want to visit. We were apprehensive when the rules / charges relating to baggage taken on board were changed, but we experimented flying with backpacks only which will fit under the seats in front and found that we could easily manage with those for a week's holiday. Since then we have happily travelled lightly and found it very easy indeed. We actually registered the fact on our most recent trip that is the ""Speedy Boarding"" passengers who now rush to queue when the boarding staff appear because they want to make sure of finding locker space as close to their seats as possible. The rest of us who have not paid extra for anything can just wait and board at our leisure. I can't recall more than one major delay in all the years we have used easyJet and just a few minor ones. On our last trip earlier this month both the outward and inward flights left and arrived slightly early. Flying out from Liverpool as we invariably do, we find it very rare that there is any nitpicking about bag sizes (despite some of the bags that we sometimes see!) and the whole process of flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed. It obviously helps that we know the ropes and that we keep abreast of any rule changes e.g. regarding baggage. It does seem to me that some of the critics fail to check on things like this and therefore are at least partly to blame when faced with charges they did not expect.",Airbus 320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Liverpool to Palma de Mallorca,January 2023,4.0,3.0,,,3.0,,5,yes,False,Liverpool,Palma de Mallorca,

I tried to add a selected seat today Nov 26th for one of the passengers, which included an extra large cabin bag and other different perks. Unfortunately, their system when you tried to get one of those selected seats, it does not allow you to continue with the process without buying obligatory another seat for the other passenger even I do not need it. So I decided to contact them by chat to see if they can get me a solution. After expending 30 minutes chatting with the customer service agent, he told me that he can provide me with this service but £5 more expensive than the website price. I asked him, why, and he mentioned that doing it through the website is cheaper. The situation was ridiculous, even though I spent precious time chatting with him, EasyJet wants to charge me more because of their badly designed system. I wished I could do it by the website without expending more time. So I recommend to people to even booked passenger tickets separately and you can manage the options individually or book flight tickets with another company which has a better system, EasyJet tries to get as much money as they can from their loyal customers. But never more, even I was one of the people affected by their famous data breach and never claim anything because I have been using Easy Jet for a long time and always I had good service.

The communication from Easy Jet came in a text. I still have a picture of the text received. We arrived at the gate prior to the original departure time to find that the flight was only 11 minutes late and because we were not at the gate two hours prior to the original departure time we were not allowed to board the airplane.

There were no other flights from CDG airport available to Lisbon that day which was not an option for us as we had to meet our tour group.

Then on the way back on the 3rd of October Ezy6414 @ 9:15, they decided my standard bag was too big for the cabin, because apparently on Feb2021, they shrunk the seats and the cabin size even more, and charged me £24 for it. That bag was half empty, I could have brought a smaller one had I known. Why are they going against standardisation? They actively want to catch you, the lady there could have let it go, it's not like that money goes to her pocket, but some people enjoy letting others down. They must hate their jobs immensely (customer service is difficult, especially with money grabbing management that are paid 6digits compared to people in her level with 1.65bn revenue).

108,G Bardero,Portugal,2022-09-18,1,"At first, the ground crew manager came up to the passengers asking for volunteers to change to another flight (they would fly to Santiago de Compostela instead, and have a bus waiting for them to take them to Porto, and all they offered was a 500€ compensation, which is much less than what they should actually have to pay every passenger if no one took the offer and they had to refuse entry to passengers) as they mismanaged and overbooked this flight (even though they kept insisting on that it was an aircraft issue and they had to use a smaller one, while the people at the check in desks said clearly that it was overbooked). After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a ""Oh sorry sir"", then the attendant moved on like nothing happened.

113,Max Hoffmann,Germany,2022-08-31,1,"I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen).  When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled ""hands off"" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit möchte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gepäckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgebühr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zurückfordern. Das ganze spielte sich den 17.08.22 um ca. 18:20 am Gate A38 des Flughafen BER ab, an welchem ich mit meiner Reisebegleitung bereits um 17:35 auf den Flug EJU5539 nach Paris Orly hätte boarden sollen. Der Flug war also schon verspätet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gepäckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgepäckstück sei zu groß. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste. Auf der Gepäckmessanlage passte er von Höhe und Breite dementsprechend auch perfekt rein. Lediglich die Dicke überschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gepäckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu spät, ich muss zahlen oder das Gepäck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal über die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andrücken exakt die Maße eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine Hände und schrie ,,Hände weg"" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben müsse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine Möglichkeit dagegen vorzugehen.

We land too late to make next flight out of London. Easyjet insist they have zero responsibility as we arrived 1.35 mins after time published for arrival so under the 2 hrs. They can get away with this by grossly exaggerating arrival time. I wondered why they were saying this short hop took so long, now I know. They are dishonest and bordering on corrupt. We had a horrific time at Gatwick, met with disdain by the most unprofessional person I've ever met. Told to rebook missed flight for 2 days later and pay transfer of £120. No assistance offered and absolutely no sympathy. Stayed in a hotel and flew with TUI the next day. They were wonderful in comparison. We all need to write to the transport secretary instead of Easyjet because they couldn't care less what customers are saying. They keep issuing lies about helping customers as much as they can but this is more corrupt nonsense. Why their staff put up with this chaos is beyond me, they should all follow their Italian colleagues and walk out. I hate to see jobs lost but I'd actually be happy to see Easyjet no longer exist.

We had extra-legroom seats in one of the over wing emergency exit rows but the standard seats looked fine for someone my height (1.74 m). Space is helped by the thin seats, I was concerned on first sitting down that these seemed rather firm but they must be well shaped because I stayed comfortable for the 3hr50 flight.

We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol.

She said the priority boarding is only for people who require special assistance. She was like “oh your flight is to Paris, you’ve got plenty of time” in a nonchalant manner. And she just spoke directly to the clients in the long queue, “next one”, waving us away.  No apologies, no emails from easyJet communicating this before we arrive at the airport and nothing was written before people started queuing. We paid an extra 50 euros for this extra convenience but they did not honour their contract and completely ignored us at the EasyJet plus counter.

Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way.

After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay.

The choice wasn't fantastic: They had a calzone, bacon sandwich and something else with bacon but by the time they got to the back the calzone was sold out and I can't have pork. I was stuck with the breakfast box, which wasn't fantastic but wasn't bad. Service was OK. There were four cabin staff, all female, and they were friendly enough, but they were all young and wouldn't stop gossiping at the back near where we were, and it did eventually get slightly annoying being forced to listen to the four women banging on about makeup.

Instead we flew to Athens, which cost us extra for the connecting flight, but you don't want to waste energy with this company, since it will get you nowhere.

In January we booked our flights to the UK with British Airways and we booked a flight from Glasgow to Belfast with easyJet. In June our British Airways flights got cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 numbers in South Africa have steadily been rising and experts estimate, that the peak will only be reached in September. Since the cancellation of our British Airways flights, I have trying to get in contact with easyJet, to let them know, that there is no conceivable way we can get to Glasgow by the 21st August. All attempts to contact easyJet have been unsuccessful. After two hours of being on line with their customer care line listening to the stupid ring tone, I realised no one was on the other line. I tried their facebook, twitter and email accounts, but could get no response at all. Earlier this year, the easyJet website clearly stated that change fees will be waived due to the pandemic, as long as the changes occur 14 days prior to the scheduled flight. When trying to change the flights tonight (14 days prior to the scheduled flight), however I was charged 228 GBP for the change fee. Please keep in mind that the original flight cost was only 192 GBP. I find this unacceptable. You should be able to contact a customer care line and explain the situation, but I've only had generic responses from robots. Extremely frustrating.

In the new dates we closed the COVID-19 problem arose again, we tried again to contact the call center, but in vain no one ever answered us. The only information we have is that they will inform us one day before our flight, if it will happen, which makes it impossible to fully manage the rest of our travel bookings because the company does not know until the last minute whether it will take us to the destination us, without of course giving us the option of a refund or a coupon.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Larnaca to Basel,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,True,Larnaca,Basel,

The Customer Service rep who I finally managed to speak to (after nearly 2 hours of constant redialling) confirmed that Easyjet have received my parents refund claim but stated that they my parents claim will have to wait up to 90 days to receive their full refund. When I informed the customer service rep that they are acting unlawful stating this and my parents may have to ask their bank to charge back the refund from Easyjet, he said ""if your parents do that, they will then owe Easyjet the cost from the banks chargeback and will not be able to fly with Easyjet again""! With an attitude like that Easyjet do no deserve to come out the other side of this successfully and carry on being able to operate. I was flabbergasted. I only hope that customers of this wholly unprofessional outfit remember the way they are currently being treated (awaiting for their hard earned refunds for cancelled flights and services they are not receiving) and go elsewhere. As I stated to the customer service rep (before I left the call), with an attitude like this, Easyjet will be lucky to still be around this time next year!

Our flight was over 5 hours delayed due to an air traffic control strike which we were informed about whilst on the plane already 2 hours delayed. We were originally booked on British Airways and they cancelled the night before, which means EasyJet would have known about the strike at the same time and failed to act accordingly (notify us or tell us there would be a delay). We were kept outside in the cold waiting to board for 30 minutes before the plane was ready, then we were kept on the plane for 4 hours without any refreshments and not letting us disembark to stretch our legs. Then we were let off the plane into the gate to buy some food, which we had to pay for ourselves and not given any vouchers. Finally, we were let back onto the plane and took off almost 6 hours after the originally scheduled take-off time. They then provided us each with a soft drink and bag of crisps - hardly something sustainable for a delay of over 6 hours. The pilot told us that they should not have treated us like this and urged us all to file a complaint and ask for compensation due to the fact that the airline failed to inform us of the strike prior to boarding/delays. The crew told us that we could not get off and refuse to take the flight if we wanted to receive compensation so we felt stuck in this regard. I filed a EC261 Compensation Claim and was rejected within less than 24 hours due to the fact that it was an ""extraordinary circumstance"" due to the air traffic control strike. The circumstances were already known 24 hours before they told us.

Going through security was very fast as they had 3 lanes open. Normally Belfast International airport is renowned for being very slow. I went to the Causeway Lounge and used my priority card for access. The lounge and service is good as there are sufficient selection of food, snacks and drinks available. They also call when boarding is starting and the lounge is located very close to the Amsterdam boarding gate. The boarding process on easyJet is by priority (speedy boarding), but you need to make sure that you are ready as it is difficult to get overhead space to put your hand baggage if you are not ahead of the queue. We pulled back on schedule and arrived in Amsterdam on schedule. You have you want something to eat or drink on easyJet you have to pay, however that is ok as the service is fast and efficient.

No delays, no canceled flights, professional and friendly crew - quite often with a good sense of humor. The prices are super competitive and they also part of an exchange now to make flying more friendly for the environment - already included in the ticket price.

281,D Murten,United Kingdom,2020-01-20,1,"Luton to Zurich. On arrival at the gate I found there was a long queue into the ‘room’ where final boarding card and passport checks are carried out. Passengers were queueing out of the room and up two flight of stairs. There were signs for ‘speedy boarding’ but these were utterly pointless due to the overcrowding in the stairwell - the only staff on hand (who should have been marshalling this situation) were staff telling people that their hand luggage would have to go in the hold as the overhead lockers would be too full - fortunately this didn’t affect me as the staff started this process well behind me at the back of the queue, which then started moving. On arrival into the room and managed to fight my way through to the speedy boarding lane - I was naturally the last person in this queue. When we boarded the aircraft I then found that there was no space in the overhead lockers anywhere near my seat (1B), mostly because they were full of hats, coats, handbags, scarves and other items which, if the cabin staff had any sense and were in any way proactive about the situation, could have been put under the seat in front. At the insistence of the particularly unhelpful male cabin crew member, I had to place my hand luggage, for which I had paid extra, in the overhead lockers about 10 rows back on one side and the other item about 13 rows back on the other. I asked him if he would be retrieving them for me on departure to which he replied ‘no, I won’t be getting them’ - I already knew the answer and I knew equally well that this would mean that I would either have to fight my way upstream to retrieve them on landing, or wait for the entire aircraft to empty before going back to get them, which is the option I took which meant that I was the last passenger to leave the aircraft...from seat 1B - absolutely ridiculous.

287,H Xi,Australia,2020-01-05,1,"I had a poor experience today flying from Zurich to London this morning at 9:30 local time. I have also flown a few times with a small backpack (to put under my feet) and a carry on luggage no problem with other airlines. The counter staff seemed unsympathetic at all and was pressuring me to just pay the CHF 76 and move along, standing in front of me just saying that it was impossible that all the stuff would fit (when I was trying to put the stuff from the small bag to the larger one.) She even went as far as to suggest to me and another family that we won't be allowed to test the luggage dimensions again and just to pay the 76 francs. (That's nearly as much as the ticket itself!) Even, when I did manage to fit the small suitcase into the slot, she said that it had to be smooth fit and that it couldn't be squeezed in. I have never expected such strictness and unreasonable behaviour from airport staff before and I can only believe it was out of spite that she said this as she realised that I had actually been able to fit the backpack into the carry on suitcase. I even saw her pressure the other family to pay just because they had an iPad that was not in the carry-on. When I got on, there was more than enough space in the overhead lockers and I had intended to put my backpack under my feet in any case to save space. In the end, I was forced by the same staff member to throw out my slippers as again she claimed they were an additional item of luggage. Seriously? All it did for easyJet, in the end, was that there was no way I would pay such a money-grabbing 76 francs and it didn't solve their issue of overcrowded luggage as the now larger suitcase was taking up more space in the overhead compartment than if I had 2 separate ones, 1 above and the small backpack underneath my feet. All in all, I believe this to be an extremely frustrating experience for both myself and easyJet as a company which could have been much better handled with more reasonable and less spiteful staff members who could have been more professional with the way they handled customers.

We were well below the (combined) baggage allowance but preferred to play it safe rather than have hassle at the airport. Equally, none of us had wheelie suitcases but the kids and my husband had little rucksacks while I took a bag that fitted into the under-seat dimensions. As a result, we had no issues at the gate. On the return flight, they were asking everyone at the back of line, where we were, with wheeled luggage to check it into the hold but they looked at our bags and said 'that's fine'. I think that you just need to follow the rules with easyJet if you want a pleasant experience. Other than that, the flights themselves were great. Friendly pilots, very friendly cabin crew and an efficient service. We had onboard snacks and drinks and they were all very good.

At Seville Airport it turned out that I was the only passenger whose luggage was lost. All my sports holiday plans were ruined on the first day. I was able to adjust them for the short-term but they managed to ruin it twice. At the airport (I arrived at ~11am), I was assured that necessary forms were filled in and I should receive all further communication by email. I’ve waited for some time - got nothing. Had to go online and manually fill in all the forms again; only after that I’ve got the first email saying “We’ll send you regular updates via SMS and email”. Since that email I have received no info by emaill/SMS in two days and had to call a few times a day to get some info, and every single time repeating all my details. Until 8pm I was not even sure if my luggage was located. Finally they’ve found it at Luton airport. No info by email/sms. Someone at the call center told me that the bag is scheduled for a flight on Day 3 and should be in Seville at 11am. Day 3: I’ve called easyjet early morning to figure out if the bag will be delivered today. Throughout the day, three people at easyjet provided me with certainty that the bag will be delivered today to my hotel in the afternoon, “certainly today”. I was a fool to trust them again one can judge. If they could only inform me that they cant guarantee a certain day of delivery - I would have come to the airport myself and collected my stuff, without which I was stuck in a Spanish village with almost nothing to do as all my holidays were dependent on my sports equipment. Easyjet turned out to be  liars as the luggage has not arrived that day. Also, only after my complaint about no communication - they did send another update, after more than 48 hours. Day 4 At 8am I reached the call renter again and a person there told me completely different info, that they have handed my bag over to the delivery center and can’t guarantee time of delivery. Why on Earth have not his colleagues told me the same info the day before?! All of them were assuring me to expect the bag in the hotel on Day 3. I was redirected to the local airport for more information. I’ve been trying to call them for 3 hours (was even wondering if this was a holiday in Spain?). Only at 11am someone picked up and told me that I should not call every day to them, and they already handed over my bag to the delivery company and no longer have info on that. I asked them to provide me with the phone number of the delivery company so I can track my bag and they were not able to provide it. I felt completely lost, miserable and helpless to be honest. At 2pm I received email which stated that the bag was delivered - it was NOT. I felt they were kidding me. Called them again - they have informed that the bag should be with me at 5pm.

I was assisted at every step throughout the airport process - from check-in, through security, up to the gate and finally on to the aircraft. On arrival in Kraków I was met by the Welcome team who not only helped me off the aircraft, into the terminal and through immigration, but escorted me to the railway station and put me on a train to the city centre. The whole process was replicated on the return journey. We often read criticism of easyJet and their ilk but I really think that people very often only write about their bad experiences. So I just want to balance the scales a little and present a ‘good news’ story. I had a wonderful time in Kraków, helped in no small part by easyJet and their partners. Thank you very much guys - you did a wonderful job! ",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bristol to Kraków,December 2019,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,,5,yes,True,Bristol,Kraków,

Later, when we got late to London, I had to wait 40 minutes for my luggage. When it finally arrived, there was no train anymore so I had to take a taxi which was really expensive. I tried to call them and the man who talked to me directly redirected me to the website without barely listening to my complaint.

307,Serra Iyi,United Kingdom,2019-11-26,4,"Bristol to Geneva. I came across the rudest, least empathetic airline employee today. After letting other women with totes and carry ons walk by she picked me out and asked me to open my carry on, put my tote in it, close it and fit it into the carry on size check boxes. My carry on is sold under description it  says allowed on EasyJet flights. When i did what she asked me to do my suitcase fit but i couldnt bend and lift the carry on again. When I asked for help she said she would come but made me wait until almost everyone had boarded. I asked her why she was being so mean to me while letting everyone else walk by with same or more luggage. No response. Instead of helping me she walked back to the line and boarded more passengers. At the end it was a kind young female passenger that helped me lift the carry on out of the size checking bars. She also commented on the employee's rudeness.  Because I was late in boarding despite having paid extra for a front row seat, my carry on ended up being stored 20 rows behind me. It will be fun finding it after landing. It is not that she asked me to check what is a standard rule at EasyJet but that she did not ask other with same or more weight to do the same so I was arbitrarily picked by her. I wish I had other choices when flying out of Bristol but Easyjet is my only option. I would really appreciate the company providing some common sense and empathy training to their customer-facing employees and ensuring that their rules are standard for all passengers, not just those an employee arbitrarily selects.

The crew did a great job attending to him but then decided that we had to divert to Gatwick so that he could go to hospital.On landing he transferred to an ambulance and my friend and I had to accompany him to Redhill hospital while the flight continued on to Majorca. After spending 5 hours with our cases he was discharged but told that he could not fly with his condition. As we had to get back to Liverpool we decided to go back to the Easyjet desk at Gatwick to see if they could advise us how we could get back home. After explaining our dilemma to a wonderful young lady, she who arranged a taxi for us to get home which involved a 500 mile round trip for the driver. She then supplied us with two tickets from Manchester to Palma the next day for two of us to continue our holiday. When I asked how much I would have to pay she said that Easyjet would foot the bill.

I was unable to find any locker space on the plane which meant I could put my bag under the seat in front, however, some may not be so lucky especially those boarding the plane last!

There was good space under the seat in front, however, be aware that you might find the seat width a bit weird on this aircraft because they are more narrow than usual so be prepared to rub shoulders with other people!

I’ve been told, rudely, that there was no more space for my small luggage and had to drop it. I gently explained that I needed the luggage with me because every minute was on the count as I was flying for a home emergency and couldn’t waste time at the airport once in Naples. She kept saying “there’s no space sir”. Then I raised, saying “My dad is dying, and I can’t wait for my luggage. Please just let me keep this with me.” She said “No, there’s no space. Just doing my job.” I’m not here to contest her arrogance, but there was not even a small track of empathy with my request. Like trying to understand the situation and at least try to find a little solution. Even because I’ve seen other people after me with some big bags or small luggage coming to the cabin. So I don’t understand the fact that was no space left. I found this very upsetting and disrespectful. This shows a completely poor attitude and a huge lack of moral and lack of professionality and lack of passion from the crew member. She might have had a tough day, maybe she was already on her second/third flight on her shift, but still: you get paid for it. It’s your job, not mine. And this is not an isolated case for Easyjet cabin crew, or in general low-cost companies. And I arrived at the conclusion that it’s sad to see tired members of staff not being focused on the customer needs but just on the Company business sides’ how to make more money “squeezing” us like limes.

342,Berik Kaliullayev,France,2019-09-22,1,"Barcelona to Paris CDG. The worst flying experience I’ve ever had. My flight was delayed for 3 hours and 30 minutes. The explanation of the delay was due to weather conditions in the city of departure (Barcelona). In fact, it was raining in the morning by afternoon it was slightly cloudy and other planes were departing on time from Barcelona. I was trying to contact the airlines by phone but it was not helpful at all. No response. Online chat button did not work and moreover, it is only available till 8 pm. During the waiting time, a representative of the air company offered the passengers a voucher for only 4 euros (a meal is much more expensive in the airport). Furthermore, the information about the vouchers was on their website an hour before they really started distributing them. The most important that I was not able to be on time at a railway station in Paris because I needed to go by train to another city in France. Being a student and having a limited budget I lost the money spent on my train ticket. The captain was very weird saying that our flight would last 1h and 35 minutes but then he said he would expect in Paris by midnight (considering the new departure time of 21:35). In fact, we started moving at 21:56 only. I’ll apply for EC261 and hope they will refund me money.

She was intentionally obstructive and unhelpful. I explained my wife was busy buying something we has not packed for our trip. The easyjet staff member could have offered to put out a PA address to call my wife but no, she was never going to be that helpful. Instead she rather just ran off a standard speech that the flight is not delayed and that I needed to go and find my wife.

Two days before our flight we went to check in online, My mother in law and father in law had no problems, but when we were checking in at the same time we were unable to check in. We contacted easy jet to be told they had over booked our seats. The only option they gave us was to turn up at 4am of the morning of the flight and see if people didn’t show up, they may arrange another plane but that wasn’t a guarantee either. We felt our only realistic option was to book another flight for my husband and I as the likely hood of people not turning up for a flight in the school holidays was unlikely and likewise with easy jet putting on another plane. We spoke to easy jet about this and had to pay again! So we paid £275 each return originally and then the new flight out because they over booked and wouldn’t guarantee anything cost £150 each. To say I am disgusted with the airline is an understatement. To not exchange our outbound flight for free as they over booked our seats that we paid for months before is beyond as is leaving clients with very little alternatives than to either cancel the holiday or re book flights.

This Friday I faced yet another 3 hour delay, I hear all those saying claim, but this doesn't return the time lost and away from my family. What it does do though is add an expensive £50 taxi fare with other transport options closed at 2am. So, the moral of my story is, with a very delayed Friday the night prior I contacted easyJets plus and flight club that I have membership of hoping that I might be permitted to move my 9pm Sunday flight to an earlier option. I advised of the issues, very politely I add, the day before asking simply to take the plane 50mins earlier. Sure £100 plus was the reply, so this is from an airline that has over £5k of my money in flights booked through to march 2020, zero empathy, zero flexibility advising turn up early and take your chances like everyone else.

It's the fact you cancel after 4 hours. Really? It takes you 4 bleeping hours to figure out you can’t take off?

I’ve never flown with easyJet before so was apprehensive anyway but was worse than anticipated. We arrived for our flight, been through security checks, all the normal procedures and then proceeded to wait around for 4/5 hours for our flight - our flight was announced cancelled. We went to the information desk and asked what to do next and we’re pointed out of the waiting lounge to the EasyJet desk. We stood in a queue of about 200 people, all upset, and waited a good 30 minutes before being told how to rebook flights. There were only two members of EasyJet staff tending to the 200+ passengers with cancelled flights, one employee on the customer service desk and one handing out leaflets. We managed to get a free hotel for the night with a dinner and breakfast and rebooked a flight for the next day. Theyhotel was mediocre, the food was awful!  The next day we arrived for our flight, again 4/5 hours to spare. We got through security checks etc, and as soon as we got through to the waiting area our flight was delayed by an hour. It was then delayed further, and then delayed again and again. We waited for an extra couple hours and to our surprise we were given a gate to go to! We rushed to the gate, waited there for about 20 minutes, we were then told we had to wait for our flight to land and passengers to get off. We proceeded to wait. We watched the plane land, the passengers get off, bags being unloaded. Flights were taking off all around us. After watching all of this, everyone was getting agitated. Many people were surrounding the gate desk, asking what was happening. No one was getting a straight answer. Later we were told our flight was yet again cancelled for the second time. We then had to wait again for buses back to the baggage area. We made it back to the EasyJet desk with a queue of about 100+ people, all angry and upset. We waited for an additional 20 minutes before someone come out to speak to the passengers. One man at the front of the queue was very angry and started to raise his voice so the manager and employees walked away, back to the staff room I presume, and refused to speak to anyone because of one angry passenger raising his voice.

I was left stranded in Zurich near midnight (not familiar at all with Zurich) and told to figure out how I would get to my destination on my own. Here is the text from them: We're sorry that your flight has diverted to Zurich airport. This is due to the closure of Basel airport. The disruption is beyond our control and is considered an extraordinary circumstance. We're very sorry but due to high demand in Zurich we are unable to arrange onward transport for you. If you’re able to make your own arrangements, we will refund the cost. Please retain all your receipts in order to make your claim.

Note ""if you are able to make your own arrangements"" and ""one of our ground crew in the airport... will be happy to help you"" I found one of the ground crew and kindly asked them for help. They told me ""go catch a train"" (I remained very polite since I know it isn't their fault). I asked them where the train station was and if they could help me figure out which train .. they stated just walk straight and turn left you will see a train station (that is all they would say or do, I was left in shock) They offered no other assistance. I found the airport train station and because it was late at night no one was working there. I had to go to the automatic ticket machines. After struggling for 15 minutes I found out that to get to Basel I would have to take two trains and one bus, all of this in the middle of the night in a place I am unfamiliar with. Why couldn't they have at least given us a map and a guide to which trains we would need to take? This could have been very easy for them to print out and offer. When I arrived at Basel (after 2:00 am) I was informed that a KLM flight who was in the same predicament as my easyJet flight - diverted to Zurich., told their passengers to wait and when the storm moved past... flew them on to Basel. I would avoid this airline at all costs, they don't really care if you make it to your destination nor do they care about your  safety.

A lot of passengers made comments to each other, including the two passengers sat next to me, at how we had been spoken to. Now I fully understand that the safety briefing is extremely important and from time to time the cabin crew have to be firm with passengers to get their attention, but there is a difference between being firm with customers and being angry/aggressive. After takeoff, most of the passengers sat quietly for the duration of the flight to Amsterdam as they felt like they had been “told off”.

As mentioned in the airport review, check in was excellent due to having HandsFree so able to use priority check in desks. This then allowed me to board at anytime during my leisure after Speedy Boarding, which I took advantage of as boarding looked a slow process. Aircraft was spotless inside and Edinburgh based crew were friendly and welcoming to everyone. Comfortable window seat, decent leg room as I’m 6”1, didn’t feel claustrophobic on this full A320. Much better than the A319 on the Glasgow-Schönefeld outbound on the Thursday where I felt squashed in the window seat. Even though the boarding looked slow at the terminal side, this was completed quickly and soon we were on our way. Service was quick to commence and a reasonable selection of products available onboard. I had prepaid for a bistro voucher so took advantage of the hot meal deal which todays hot selection was the Ham and Cheese Croissant. Hot all the way through, and sufficient for an early evening snack along with a chocolate bar and Earl Grey Tea. Also had a few G&T’s which was perfectly reasonable in terms of price, €14 Remember, these are served as double measures. About 3/4 of the way through the flight I went to pour my last gin when realised that during the trash run, I gave them the full bottle of gin rather than the empty one! So while heading to the back to the toilet, I had a laugh with the crew mentioning what I had done. To my surprise, one of the crew opened the recycling bag and had a quick check to see if the full bottle was amongst the trash. I did not expect that, and we had a laugh about it. No luck, which I assumed. During decent, the cabin manager was making her was from the back, stopped at my row and handed me over a g&t, they had found the full bottle, yet it was too dirty to hand back, so gave me a fresh one.

After my plane being pushed back from 9:10pm to 11pm and finally being able to start the boarding, an Easyjet employee came to me and asked me if I am an EasyJet Plus or Speed Boarding customer to whom I answered that I am not. She then continued and claimed that I had to pay £40 in order to get my cabin luggage into the plane because I was carrying a tiny bag (20cm x 20cm) that I was planning to keep between my legs. I told her that I know that the overhead lockers are limited in terms of space, so I would keep the other bags on my knees or under the passenger seat in order to allow other passengers to put heavier luggage in the lockers. I also explained that I asked multiple times to EasyJet crew about this kind of bags and they were perfectly fine with me taking it in the plane as it is not really a cabin suitcase, so she was the first one to ever ask me to pay for it. She kept saying ""Sorry This is the policy, you have to pay £40 for your luggage!  not showing any sign of compassion or understanding. I explained that with a plane 1h and 50 minutes behind schedule, there was no way I was going to pay an extra £40 for my 20cmx20cm bag on a ticket that was already not worth it considering the delay. She replied: ""You have to pay or I'm going to call security and you are not going to be able to board on your flight"". I had to unpack my luggage in front of everyone compressing all the things that were in my briefcase in my cabin luggage, with this employee not helping.In the end, the woman let me through and 5m after I passed the boarding, I unpacked everything and kept my bag between my legs the entire flight not bothering anyone.

Personally, I find the free carry-on bag allowance pretty generous). The flight was delayed 30 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft, which is still reasonable for any airline these days.

Flight arrived late, late announcement of gate at 1.35 but boarding same kept same 1.40, announced that gate closing, gave 5 minutes to come a long distance to gate 112, arrived gate at 1.50, boarding wasn’t started and plane just arrived. - Representative checked boarding pass and said £50 extra charge for each item that is not in the carry-on including laptop, iPad, jackets, personal purse, vanity, medications. Tried to put all of the items in carry on bag for all 4 passengers. In order to avoid paying £50 for each person, threw away two personal bags and stuffed all in checked in bags. Laptop, iPad, money bag and jacket was left in one personal bag. Representative insisted to stuff  all in 1 carry on because no personal items allowed. I showed her the board outside the boarding area, which says allowed personal items, she said, ""the board is not applicable to my ticket"". EasyJet was my connecting flight. We started with the same carryon on WestJet Airlines from Los Angeles to Calgary to Gatwick. Same carry-on with personal items was okay with WestJet but wasn’t okay with EasyJet. Representative said each airline has their policy. I charged £50 to my credit card and told her that easyjet will get 4 bad reviews today, she said, ""nothing she could do"". Now I’ll have to go to baggage claim for the one of the carry-on's that were checked in, which will delay my plans in Paris. I was in my seat at 2.25 pm, flight left the gate at 2.45 pm, take off at 3.10 pm (instead of 2.10 pm). Landed in Paris at 5.10 pm (instead of 4.10 pm). Baggage took 30 minutes to arrive at baggage area. Uber ride started at 6.10, overall 1.5 hours lost.

Airlines inside were okay, food offered at reasonable cost, water was available at cost. Of course no Entertainment. It was cold and no blankets or pillows were provided. Thank goodness I took out my jacket from the checked in bag. No announcement to apologize for delay in departure or arrival to Paris. I may have saved £50 when I booked my tickets but ended up paying that back to EasyJet, airline found an easy way to make money. Is there any governing body that could punish bad and intentionally fraudulent practices by airlines like EasyJet? I’m not sure if my review will make any change in EasyJet’s behavior towards their customers. Don’t they know flight will depart late, boarding will be late because it arrived late? If yes, why did they announce at 1.35 that the gate is closing and made us run? I’m sure many customers felt the stress and pain due to EasyJet’s unprofessional behavior and bad communications with customers. Considering my experience, I’m not going to fly again with EasyJet. There were other customers at the gate explaining similar issues, I’m sure they wouldn’t fly and give bad reviews. All my friends will stay away from EasyJet.

In booking with them for a flight to Sofia from Gatwick, I looked on line, and was pleased to see that they now included one cabin bag and personal item in the cost of their tickets, so I booked with them. I assumed that this was an attempt to compete with other discount airlines like Ryanair, etc. We checked in on line, and while waiting at the gate to board, there was an EasyJet employee going through the line and picking people out of the line and charging them a 50 pound fine for having an extra bag. She got a number of people as she did this and had a machine at the ready to charge our credit cards. When I protested, she said that our personal items were too big, and that I should have read the terms and conditions more carefully. How many people do that? Without being a member of their ""Easy travellers"" group, it was the same as always, and we were ""fined"" 100 pounds because our personal items were too large. Had we known, we would have factored that additional charge into the cost of our flight, and would have likely flown with someone else as the EasyJet flight was much more than other airlines with the additional baggage cost, and they flew at inconvenient times, and into the nasty, old disused terminal at Sofia Airport.

However, we weren’t aware that on the return journey this would mean we were part of the lazy crew’s party near the front of the plane. This activity all seemed to centre on friends they also had on the plane - and I know from a friend of my daughter that Easyjet staff can add anyone as family so we suspect high fares such as ours subsidise flights of any random person the crew might know. There was one guy in an EasyJet uniform who was a passenger but was sitting in the best seats in the house given lots of free food by his over attentive friend (before anyone else was served). Subsided again by paying passengers? Regular passengers such as we were overlooked (the guy at the end of our row was asked if he wanted anything but we weren’t). The crew later deny this but asking requires eye contact and a response. You’d think they’d want to sell their pricey refreshments but this crew were only eager to socialise with mates. They were banging against the barrier between us and them throughout the flight, carrying on so loudly we couldn’t hear through our headphones. People trying to get to the loo had to wait down the aisle. Complete joke. At the end of the flight the cabin manager made a jokey PA announcement thanking the crew for their hard work. He was laughing about it. You couldn’t make this stuff up. I laughed as well for different reasons - another crew member and the off-duty staff member sitting across our row immediately begin to challenge me so I told them the truth - no service and loud noise meant for a rotten flight. Well these guys didn’t like that and began denying everything. We held our ground and the off-duty guy became quite aggressive, almost shouting. On other airlines if a passenger did that they’d call the cops. The cabin manager told him to stop (in a far more polite way than he was speaking to us) and this off-duty guy loudly retorts that as he is a passenger he’ll do what he wants. I told him I wasn’t some weakling he could push around and at that point the pilot came out, ignored me and went to speak to my daughter- who was by now near the plane door and quite upset as she’s a nervous flyer and these lunatics weren’t helping. Pilot just said “Sorry for the inconvenience.” To quote the crew member when I told him I had video of their ‘party’ - “whatever”. Who trains these people? No one would be my guess.

We booked our flight two and a half months ahead of time, and when I went to check-in for my flight, the website had said I had to visit the desk when I arrived at the airport. Thinking there was no issue, I arrived at the airport for EasyJet to tell me that I did not have a seat on the plane. Her exact words were, ""You paid for the flight, not for a seat."" Apparently, people who pay 24 euros extra to choose their seat have priority in getting a seat on the plane over those who do not. So, since they overbooked the flight, I did not have a seat on the plane I paid for (and neither did my friend), but our other friend did and had to travel to Paris alone. A worker escorted my friend and I to a counter where we got a new reservation for a flight that was 5 hours later than our original flight. We did get a 9 euro voucher and ""speedy boarding,"" but overall a flawed system and do not recommend booking with EasyJet unless you want to pay 24 euros extra to choose a seat or want to run the risk of spending 10 hours (total) in the airport. We also had to go through security again after visiting the counter where they rescheduled our flight.

The crew in the airport could not give reason as to why we weren’t allowed the same as the way there - their only reply was “well you were lucky on the way here then” in a very sly and sarcastic tone. They wanted to charge us €60 per case to go in the hold. I felt humiliated and embarrassed, having to pull out personal items such as underwear etc in front of over 100 individuals who were getting on to the flight. There was no privacy provided to try and rearrange the bags. After re-arranging the bags, and managing to get everything in to the one bag, the crew in the airport then called to say that cabin bags could be put in the hold for free  as the flight was busy and they would need any space possible. They do this after watching us struggle to put our items all in to one small cabin case. Why could they not have just let us wait till the end, and asked us to put our cases in the hold?

Our flight was cancelled the morning of our flight and after talking to the easyJet staff we were told no flights would be available for the next 2 days including the day that we were intended to fly. The strange part was that there were other easyJet flights flying out of the same airport the same afternoon just a few hours after our flight was cancelled due to a ""strike"". We had reservations and plans booked in Venice in advance for this trip so we needed to get to our destination. There is no travel insurance that will reimburse you for your cancelled flight unless the entire airport was shut down due to weather - that leaves it up the the airline. Travel insurance will also not reimburse you for costs incurred due to the cancelation and will not reimburse for reservations that were ruined as a result. There was no offered compensation or alternative option of travel offered by the airline. We were refunded the cost of our flight but that does not compare to that we needed to book tickets on an alternative airline which cost 9 fold. Pay 80$ now for a flight but pay 700$ at the door for an alternative flight. Thank you easyJet for this experience. Pay the extra money to book with a different airline and save yourself a headache.

445,Alex Nicholls,United Kingdom,2019-04-02,1,"Flights to and from Amsterdam from Gatwick booked weeks ahead and both journeys checked in before we left the UK. Not the cheapest flights available but economy. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before flying, in plenty of time, clear security easily and go to the gate area to wait for a specific gate. 10 mins before the scheduled departure another passenger notices that the departure time has changed from 19.45 (imminently) to 17.50, no other information. This causes other passengers to check their app to discover, then relate to us, that the flight has been cancelled. Not delayed, just cancelled, and that the 17.50 departure is the next day, Saturday. Savvy frequent flyers rushed off, knowing what to do, some even got alternative flights with other airlines. We were left standing with no information and no instructions what to do. There were no EasyJet staff on hand to explain, to offer suggestions or just tell us where to go. Eventually we found an information desk and they directed us back out to the Departures hall (back through the Baggage Hall and Passport Control) to the EasyJet check in guest where the other 150 or more passengers were waiting to find out what they were going to do. I waited in the queue for about 90 minutes to get to the front to be handed a piece of paper with the name of a hotel on it and the next day's flight details. It took them 30 seconds to give it to me. When I asked why they didn't just hand that out to the whole queue the poor desk staff, (who were not EasyJet staff just local airport representatives), said sorry the 40 rooms they had at the airport were full so we had to go back into town. So a train back in Amsterdam, a taxi to the hotel (which was very nice) but no meal as promised by EasyJet and by then the kitchens were closed. The next day our replacement flight is the last one out of Amsterdam, not the first or anything else during the day. The amazing thing is that there are no EasyJet people to talk to. None of the staff are theirs, not the check in or the gate staff. They know EasyJet are rubbish so they are practised at apologising. Don't fall for the cheap price, it's not worth it. The delays are inevitable, the cancellations random and the service non-existent. Pay a little bit more to know that when it does go wrong, as it will, there is someone there that can help you. The next day I had downloaded the app in order to check in on line. Using the flight tracker I could see the incoming flight from Alicante. Maybe the day before it came from somewhere else but the method is; plane comes in, offloads passengers then gets sent on somewhere else. The Friday flight was cancelled due to 'a staff welfare issue'.  Whatever, it must have been known about on the other flight, for some time, to allow then to make alternative arrangements for a spare pilot, 2nd officer, navigator?, cabin crew. But no, EasyJet don't do that because they care more about the bottom line than customer service. About 180 passengers on an A320 Airbus. Each passenger entitled to a minimum of 250 euro compensation plus hotel rooms, transfers, food etc, could cost them 63,000 as a conservative estimate for 1 cancelled flight. A lot more than the cost of one or two spare crew on standby. I learn today that Amsterdam is an EasyJet hub airport. But it doesn't matter to them, the only thing that matters is bums on seats.

I used to work for an airline and I know how the system works with EasyJet, so I know that every flight has a no show percentage, but I do not expect to need to have luck to board a flight with a normal ticket, purchased more than 4 months ago. I had two options ahead of me: 1 wait till the end of the boarding even if I had a ticket already - 2 in case there was no seats available, getting a hotel room and wait time to be refunded, and leave the morning next. Both solutions were for me ridicolous as we are talking about tickets that I purchased more than 4 months before, considering the fact that I needed those tickets to get back home in Berlin.

466,D Hashan,United Kingdom,2019-02-18,1,"I booked my holiday through EasyJet holidays. Service from Manchester to Agadir was excellent and i did wonder why EasyJet had thousands of bad reviews. Staff onboard the flight were really helpful. The transfer from airport to hotel was perfect and the hotel itself was amazing. The nightmare started when we boarded the return flight from Agadir (EZY1906) at 8:20pm. The pressure of serving customers food must have got to the manager of the onboard team. Customers were being ignored when they asked for assistance, one passenger asked for sugar and the staff member responded “I’ve only got two hands”. One customer asked for tissue three times. I witnessed another incident where a large female woman walked past and both staff members grinned at each other whilst looking at her in disgrace. The members of staff were blind to the fact that they were doing this infront of passengers. One passenger looked at me and said this is what you expect from a budget airline. I disagreed. No passenger should be treated like this. I have travelled may countries around the World, but must say that this particular EasyJet flight was the worst. A great holiday ruined on return. I personally think EasyJet could become a great airline if the right staff training is provided. As mentioned above, the staff on departure were excellent.

Since it was already after midnight it was nearly impossible to find a mode of transport back to Paris. With sheer luck, and a combination of night bus and cab I finally managed to arrive at my place at 2:30 am instead of 11 pm. What is angering me the most is that easyJet just drops you off at the airport and disappears even though it was clearly there fault. No excuse, nothing. Never again.

Things started with a 45 minutes delay leaving, which is routine but not excusable, on their flights later in the day. The latest seats are now so thinly padded and packed in that people can’t help poking each other’s arms or kneeing each other’s backs and sitting down for a flight of a few hours is altogether very uncomfortable. The cabin was clean. The crew were fairly pleasant, seemed safety conscious, were all young and did their tasks efficiently. The quality and price ratio in the range of on board drinks and snacks is significantly better than the competition but the substantive fresh food is dull, often understocked on returns and of low quality. I wouldn’t ever pay for any speedy boarding - but those that did have such privileges for one reason or another didn’t get any benefit from it in Cyprus. Instead, the queue surged forward for us to spend the traditional half an hour queuing on a jetway staircase before walking over the runway to the plane. Boarding on the plane was chaotic, involved arguments between crew and passengers about locker space, and caused delay. During the journey, some of the total delay was announced as ‘made up’ but much of this is down to the customary padded schedule. The price was excellent and the plane was full in February.

Cabin staff are much more friendly and the seats are 100% more comfortable. The only reason I didn't give a 10/10 is the shambles at check-in at FNC. With three flights departing in short order there were only three desks open to check-in up to 500 passengers. The queues were out of the terminal door and it took us 45 minutes to check-in.

482,W Baker,United States,2018-12-16,1,"Let me begin by saying this is by far the worst flight experience I have ever had, and that begins prior to even leaving the tarmac. We begin by finding out our gate only 20 min prior to boarding. After rushing to the site and waiting in an incredibly slow moving line, we were met by a customer service representative stating our bags did not meet requirements, and would not give a clear explanation as to what the requirements were. As the line behind us was so long, she barked orders at us and suggested we pay the GBP50 baggage fee as opposed to finding a solution so she could get the line moving, and perhaps make some commission. Finally, she checked a bag for us for the price of dealing with her attitude. We continued onto the plane where we were made to wait 1hr to leave the tarmac due to a single missing passenger. We found this out through a series of unprofessional announcements from a male flight attendant. Beyond that, some occurrence with a lithium battery unidentified was in a checked bag, resulting in an additional 40 minute delay to find the device (this could be a source of easyjets abnormal 1 bag policy forcing someone to decompose their bag and repack it in a rush). His child was vomiting as they searched for his bag. On top of this, France went on strike during this process creating an even longer delay as we had to reroute around them. The only compensation to be offered was lukewarm water. Flight attendants could later be found charging people on the flight for snacks and beverages since they were now 2 hrs behind on dinner. This is the consequence of LGW’s overall disorganization as a facility along with the poor quality of easy jet to design practical tools for their employees to meet customer service needs.

It was at the airport that I realized I didn't have my passport. I went up to the Easyjet desk and explained to them that I do not have my passport and it most likely was left at a shop in Central Rome. At this time, it was only an assumption that my passport was there. This is because I received a missed call from a Rome number the night before.  I spoke to the man about my situation and he said that it would be fine for me to go retrieve my passport and come back and book a flight (fully knowing that my original flight was at 9:50 am and it would take me 2 hours round trip to get my passport from Central Rome). He said that once I had my passport he can go ahead and book a new flight for me no problem, I just had to pay the difference. I wanted to make sure I knew everything I needed to know before leaving the airport and just wanted reassurance that there would be space available for me when I come back to book my flight to Paris. He said everything was fine, just go get my passport. I come back to the airport and an employee says there is nothing she can do and that I had to buy a completely new flight.

I tell her I just booked the flight like 2 minutes ago but I booked for the wrong day, can she change the flight for me. She says that for her to change the flight Easyjet will keep 40-50 euros for the change. You can imagine how frustrated I was at this point. I compromise and purchase a new flight even though her colleague told me I would only have to pay the difference, I go and book my own flight because an Easyjet employee with a computer right in front her, says that she can’t help me, and on top of that the they are charging me to change a flight that I literally had booked 2 minutes prior to talking to her. It just didn’t make any sense. Nowhere did I read that there is a 2 hour time limit on booking a new flight. Nowhere did I see that Easyjet would keep a portion of what you had paid just to change the flight on top of paying a difference.

502,G Peale,United Kingdom,2018-10-18,2,"I have used easyJet many many times since their earliest flights. Everything has been reasonably acceptable given the limitations of a no-frills airline and the intricate trickery of the booking system. However the company shows a completely different character if anything non-standard occurs and the customer experience now becomes a completely different one. EasyJet pre-emptively cancelled a Marseilles to Bristol flight at the end of June on the basis of a threatened French air traffic control strike. In the event there was no strike. For myself and my wife I spent £530 pounds and not a little stress to return to Bristol by train.​ ​ I have since attempted to recover these costs under 'Expense Claim. Replacement Travel to your Destination'. That's where the fun starts. To attempt any interaction with Customer Services or the mis-named 'Resolution Team' unearths a most unpleasant side to the happy, smiling image the Company would like to portray.​ ​ I attempted to upload travel receipts to the online claim form. Problem. Webchat agent twice told me it would only work with Google Chrome! Advised to forward all by mail to Luton. Eventually Customer Services replied to say claims were only allowable online. Again told to use Google Chrome despite quite efficiently receiving my payments for many years by Internet Explorer/Edge. Another Webchat agent under duress sent me a link to send all claims documents. Sent but worryingly no acknowledgement. Webchat again promised response from Claims within 24 hrs. Nothing. Tried phoning but gave up after 1hr15mins. Sent complaint. Promised response within 28 days. Still waiting after 40. Webchat again. Usual pre-scripted press-button patronising platitudes but promised a response same day! Silly me to get excited because nothing. Today another little webchat. I was informed that the CASE HAS BEEN closed and that I should call the Resolution Team ! Now it's getting laughable.....if only! Tried phoning them this morning but lost the will to live after 1hr10mins and gave up.​ ​ I've now got much better things to do. So, easyjet you have avoided yet another justifiable recompense through your patently obvious policy of distraction, obfuscation, confusion, frustration, false sympathy, untruths and diversion.

Thirdly, I was promised to be one of the first to get their bags, which didn’t happen and I had to wait for almost 40 minutes while the other passengers where already taking their bags.

Our flight out from Luton was boarded and pushed back from the stand and head down the taxi way towards the run way only to be met half way down by a follow me car from the airport and parked on a remote stand at Luton. This was after what I can describe has the worst aircraft marshalling I have seen since I watched a charity clip by the RAF on UTUBE. Luton Airport wonders why it is getting so many bad reviews and bad press. Why board an aircraft which you know is going to be subjected to a 30 minute delay. The aircraft captain told everyone that the was an ATC delay due to congestion en route but this would of been known before the aircraft was boarded so why board it? But when we did get underway the crew due to tail winds were able to make up the 30 minute delay and arrival on stand on time. The service on board was slick and professional. The menu was good value for money and we had pre ordered which is a new service and I can recommend this to any one. The return trip we left 35 minutes late due to the aircraft which was been used arriving late from its trip to Luton. However again the crew were able to make up 20 minutes of the flight time arriving into Luton 15 minutes late. But due to the non existent cowboy ground handling company and the jobs worth mentality of its staff who could only manage to be bothered to use one set of aircraft stairs for a full A320 which was parked on a remote stand meant we were kept waiting 35 minutes before we got into the terminal building.,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Luton to Heraklion,September 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,,5,yes,True,Luton,Heraklion,

This meant that staff were taking bags from people to put them in the hold whilst they were queuing to get on the plane. Unfortunately this meant a two tier system as some were lucky and got away with huge bags whilst others were not. The staff were firm but also rude and insisted one lady exited the queue to go and pay for her luggage to be placed in the hold. EasyJet should make it clear that all bags larger than the size listed in their website will be placed in the hold and charged for and this should be enforced at check in, not afterwards. Our flight was delayed by around 2.5 hours. Anxious not to pay each traveller the £3 we were entitled to we were boarded into a priority access area. Queued to go through an electronic passport check only to have queue to have them checked again before boarding. Once on board we err asked to sit quickly to avoid losing the take off slot. Then a staff member demanded boarding passes from some passengers. She was rude and abrupt with them and offered no explanation for her demand despite the passenger being very pleasant with her. The delay meant we were travelling at dinner time and the food options are very basic. Due to the quick changeover the choices were further reduced as they quickly ran out of some selections. Food is poor. I was in row 8. I got the last ham and cheese sandwich. It was really dry. Pretty gross really even for airline food. My husband opted for a bacon baguette. Strangely the bacon was just about cooked but the baguette was dry. He had to ask for the ketchup it was supposed to come with and was given one sachet despite the advert offering two sachets.

We did that then when we arrived to the checking point, a lady was there that stopped as and told us that our ticket allow us to only have one cabin bag for each person, meaning that us ladies who carry a handbag and has a small carry on bag, can’t go in with both unless they already have payed for a ticket that allow you to carry both! I And they make you put your carry on bag in a metal thing to see if it fits or not, if it doesn’t, you have to go back and pay extra to load your cabin bag as if its a luggage bag, 47€ per bag if it doesn’t fit that thing, and if we wanna do that whole thing we have to stand in line for another hour, so they have the option to pay 16€ to get into “fast lane” which changes your seat to the front seat. It’s a money-sucking company, definitely not a saver, you will pay the money you saved on things you didn’t even thought of, if you’re on a budget and traveling alone, dont have much stuff, go for it, if you’re a family traveling definitely I don’t recommend it!

After sending these data, no reply. The next message was that my case is closed because I never sent any data they requested. On the previous flight I had even worse experience.

Then, all the passengers had to wait for further instructions until 2 am. No one told us in the company offered us help or gave us an explanation, we had to go ourselves. There was a group of elderly people that were sitting uncomfortably on the luggage claim. Of course, easyjet’s staff didn’t care. Two passengers were kind enough to get some chairs from the reception for the elderly. At 2am one bus arrived and we weren’t even told. The staff just left us wait without any updates. Ironically we get the updates from the passengers instead of the staff. The nightmare continue when your company hire a bus driver who doesn't didn’t know the direction of the hotel. He drove in circles around the airport for an hour until we reach the hotel which was very far from Paris. By the time we get to to check in to the room it was already 3 am and we had to get up early in order to get breakfast. Next day (July 18th), we found ourselves with the same situation. We had to ask for updates ourselves on what to do next. We were told to go to the airport to settle everything. If we hadn’t done that we would lose the bus to the airport. Once we were there, they told us there are no more flights today, so we need to stay in a hotel until Saturday (21th of July), when there’s a flight to Edinburgh. If that’s it’s not inconvenient enough, they made us wait again more than an hour to get the hotel confirmation and we were told to come back to the aiport to reschedule the stay on the every following consecutive day.

I arrived way too early at the airport (3h before departure) and still had to run to get on the plane. It all began when I received and email saying that the overhead lockers on-board this SmartLynx A320 are too small to fit easyjets usual cabin baggage. It also said that I could drop off my cabin luggage at the easyjet plus check in desks. To confirm that I asked at customer services if I could indeed drop off my bag at that desk to which they said yes. When the check in for my flight opened, I came back to the terminal to find an immense line to the counters. Fortunately the easyjet plus desk had no such line. I went there and then got called at and kicked out by a ground operations worker and had to endure 2h of line for the normal check in. In the end we got called to a separate desk because if not we would not have made it to our gate on time. When I finally reached a desk, the employee had no idea what I was talking about when I explained the situation with the cabin luggage and needed help from 2 other employees. Finally I dropped of my bag and sprinted towards the gate. I made it to my gate with my belt in my hand because I didn't even have time to put it back on after security.

By Smartphone App I was informed about a delay of the flight but there was no indication how long the flight would be delayed. This information was communicated to us by loudspeaker announcement. The check in was very pleasant and fast. The employee was interested in a smooth process. There were problems at the security checkpoint because the flashlight I wanted to take with me was apparently too big. Well, the rule is the rule. So I went out again to take the flashlight away. When I came back the check in was already closed but since the flight was not yet there I was waved through the premium entrance as the security staff still remembered me. That was very obliging. After the new security check everything was just right and I arrived at the gate just in time.

As soon as she boarded the attendants gave her a bottle of water, then as soon as we took off, she got two gin and tonics, well before any other passenger had been served - did she pay of course not.

It's normal for them to board on time and keep waiting on a craft for an hour or keep at the gate with no info. Half an hour delay become a standard and noone cares about passengers connections. Besides stuff is less and less qualified and motivated. Sometimes they hardly speak English and make no effort to make themself understood. I'm really disappointed with the company performance.

We arrived at Copenhagen airport just over an hour before the flight, and were surpised to be called for the flight almost inmediately we had passed through security. Walking through the airport I realised why, however - the budget airline wing of CPH is a very long way away from the main lounge area. The gate area for the budget flights is basic but there is a small shop for snacks and drinks. Boarding into a 'pen' commenced before arrival of the incoming flight, so we were stood in a queue for quite a while, but boarding was rapid once the inbound flight had arrived. Only real negative was the plane had clearly not been cleaned on the turnaround, and there was a fair amount of rubbish inside. The aircraft was one of the older easyJet planes and was showing its age - they really could do with a refurb of the older planes in the fleet now. Once on board, the pilot announced that storms were causing major delays into Gatwick and we might have to wait some time - an hour or more - for a takeoff slot. However, 15 minutes later the pilot informed us that he had managed to pursuade Gatwick to give us an earlier slot and we were cleared for takeoff straight away - I was impressed at these efforts. In flight, the crew were as good as I've come to expect from easyJet and the pilots gave the customary route updates, which are always welcome. We landed at Gatwick 15 minutes early, which was impressive as I noted from the arrivals board that almost every other flight that evening had a 1 hour or longer delay. Imnigration was surprisingly quiet for a bank holiday.

They just cannot bee relied on for domestic U.K. travel. Be extremely worried if you receive an email a few days before your flight if it says that the flight will be operated by easyJet Europe as this seems to mean inevitable delays happen. On this occasion the incoming flight arrived late and so missed its window to then avoid a weather related issue at Luton. EasyJet initially refused to pay out compensation because of the Luton related weather issues - when it was pointed out to them that their own flights landed at Luton around the time mine was due to land and BA had found it possible to depart Inverness later and arrive at Heathrow on time they then blamed more French traffic control and weather systems in Europe. This seems to be an airline that cannot respond to any small issue elsewhere in Europe and then meet its timetable. In future I will either use a more expensive but reliable flat carrier or the train. The train would have been quicker all the way from Inverness to London with these delays and they pay out if just 30 minutes late whoever fault it is.

I don't know who handles them in Vienna but we arrived to drop our bags and found the easyJet Plus counter unmanned. Thinking we were slightly early we waited. After a few minutes we were approached by a man who peremptorily ordered us to join the main queue. I refused point blank and told him as easyJet Plus customers we expected to get what we'd paid for, i.e. priority service. With no good grace he got behind the counter himself and did what he had to do so abruptly that I was surprised when our bags arrived in Edinburgh. Not a good way to treat loyal customers. At Edinburgh we landed ten minutes early and Menzies Aviation ran true to form. Firstly we came to a grinding stop on the apron because, as a clearly exasperated Captain told us, nobody had turned on the ground guidance system required for the aircraft to park on the stand. Having finally got on stand we then sat unable to deplane for almost a quarter of an hour because there were no steps. Three women with day-glo jackets and clipboards stood outside chatting, occasionally looking at the aircraft and clearly doing nothing useful. Once we eventually got off I asked a day-glo lady if the aircraft's arrival had come as a surprise to them. ""Well we were waiting for the steps"" was the response. Gosh, you don't say. I know from this and several similar experiences that you obviously don't have enough kit or enough people to handle the aircraft you're paid to handle. Not good enough.

One of them delayed more than 3 hours which caused us missing our connecting flight. We had to then buy new tickets, £90 each. The person at the desk treated us disrespectfully when we explained our situation and talked to us as if everything that he was saying was self explanatory and he was wasting his time telling us what he was. When purchasing the tickets, he told us there were 3 seats on the plane that we could take, we only had to get our seat numbers at check-in - we weren't given them there. When boarding we were told we were stand byers and that they didn't know if there were seats for us. We were then asked to step back; when asked if we could wait beside the desk, they said no and told us to stay aside. We were the last to get on the plane, after a few calls from the staff who weren't certain if there were seats for us till the last moment. At that point the flight already had more than an hour delay. We landed at 10 pm.

Then the fun begin. No other flights offered, no help to get back to London. Had to spend a couple hours trying to figure out a way back and ended up taking a 6 hour train ride instead of a 1 hour flight. Wasn't able to make it to my hotel in Oxford, and due to the late cancellation, lost the money I spent on the hotel. Best part was that Easyjet only refunded me €95 out of the €250 I spend on the ticket. Can't figure that one out and am trying to get an answer from them. So I'm now out cost of hotel, cost of plane ticket, cost of train trip, and a whole day lost on my vacation.

On each occasion the flights were late with the delays being 70 minutes, 45 minutes and 2 hours respectively. On board staff were as helpful and apologetic as they could have been, but the impression remains of an airline that has severe organisational and punctuality issues. Information provided via their app and at the airport is inconsistent and unreliable and boarding is not well organised or pleasant with passengers being corralled into enclosures like cattle before boarding and then made to wait for an indefinite amount of time. When fees for seat reservations and hold bags are taken into account the price advantage over legacy airlines is marginal at best.

573,S Moxhay,United Kingdom,2018-07-06,1,"I had one of the worst experiences of any company ever when I attempted to fly with Easyjet. It has cost me £510, a day at Stansted airport and ruined my husband’s birthday. We arrived at the airport at 11am for a flight at 1:05pm. We checked a bag in and went to departures. After going to the allocated gate about 45mins before flight departure time we waited and were told there was a technical issue with the plane and were then told that we would need to get another plane which was due to land shortly. Then an hour at the gate with no further news. Then there was an announcement saying we should go back to the departure lounge as there was a gate change. We were taken by bus back to the departure lounge and when we looked at the screen info it flashed up that the plane would be leaving in 1 hours time and that the gate was 81. I looked online at the Easyjet flight tracker which still said that the plane was due to leave about 20mins previous to the current time so was incorrect. So we were not sure of when the plane would actually leave and thought we’d wait for announcements or info on screen in the departure lounge. We kept looking at the screen and all it ever said was ‘Gate change’. It didn’t say ‘go to gate’, ‘boarding’ or ever again an expected departure time. Then after about 1.5 hours it just disappeared off the screen. We were alarmed but there is no information desk at stansted to ask anyone what is going on. We wandered around until eventually asking someone with a walkie talkie who happened to be walking through. She called and found out that since we had been sitting there waiting for information our bag had been removed from the plane and it had left. No announcements had been made, no information on the board. We couldn’t believe it. They had taken our bag off the plane but hadn’t bothered to make an announcement calling us to the gate. There was never anything in the board saying ‘go to gate’ ‘boarding’ etc. Basically they hadn’t updated the screen info. We then experienced the worst customer service ever. After being dumped with various people with no explanation of what was going on we ended up speaking to the so called ‘manager’ at the Easyjet desk. She was woman called Rochelle who made no apology for our situation and could not have been less helpful, she treated us with utter contempt. I’ve never known such awful customer service. She said we should call the Easyjet phone line (which is actually a call centre in South Africa). We did this and they said the communication failure was something we should take up with Easyjet at the airport. But the representatives at the airport said it was nothing to do with them and there was no one we could complain to. Basically if something like this goes happens Easyjet are the absolute worst company to deal with. We were left unable to speak to anyone- everyone just said it wasn’t their responsibility. The awful Rochelle at one point said she didn’t actually really work for Easyjet but another company called Stobarts. So if some mistake is made at the airport you can’t complain, you lose your money and get no apology. I lost over £500 on the lost flights and holiday, it ruined my husband’s birthday and we were treated so poorly by Easyjet staff. The previous flight I got with Easyjet was delayed by 5 hours with no apology too. It’s a big mistake to choose this airline.

I was initially worried that boarding would have been absolute chaos but in the end the staff at the gate were very professional and the boarding procedure was really organized. The cabin crew and both pilots were extremely nice and friendly and the atmosphere onboard was very relaxed. Food and drink isn't too expensive and they have a really good selection.

I did reserve a seat in the emergency exit row (window) and had speedy boarding.

Furthermore, since everybody else boarded when the speedy boarding announcement was made this is no advantage. As expected no free drinks/water/food during the flight.

The easyJet product is basic but acceptable - the aircraft was clean and the cabin crew friendly. I did not pay for allocated seating - the randomised seating that you get is a bit annoying. My main complaint is about the queuing. The outbound flight was delayed by 25 minutes. This is understandable, there were slot restrictions into AMS, but there the delay was not put on the screen seven though easyJet must have known about it and the gate closed before the plane actually got to the stand with passengers left to wait (fortunately in the gate). Don't think that you will get on a delayed flight if you are running late. There was a delay at LTN because the entry gate would not open and everyone had to wait on the apron although this was presumably down to the airport. The return flight was fine - we actually arrived on the gate a few minutes early and I wisely decided to remain seated and be the one of the last to leave the gate, given that the airline has allocated seating, having seen people waiting in lines on the ramp.

615,L Cadwallader,United Kingdom,2018-03-26,9,"Liverpool to Larnaca. I think that our recent experience clearly illustrates the difference companies like easyJet have made as far as foreign travel is concerned: we have just had a very enjoyable week’s holiday in Cyprus for less than it cost for just the flights on our first visit there over 30 years ago. On that occasion we were going to stay with friends and to reach Cyprus as “cheaply” as possible we had to drive to Heathrow, stay overnight and then travel via Budapest with a seven-hours’ layover in the airport there. Last week we had an hour’s drive to Liverpool and direct flights for two of us for a total of just over £140! We were not sure how we would cope with flights lasting 5 hours each way, as we normally restrict ourselves to 3 hours or less, but we equipped ourselves with plenty to occupy the time and the journeys were relatively painless. Both flights departed and arrived pretty promptly, cabin staff worked hard and efficiently without going over the top and the cockpit crews kept us informed. The plane on the outward journey had the new-style seats which we do not find particularly supportive though they were tolerable, but we were more comfortable on the return flight with the older, more thickly padded seats. Possibly the boarding procedure could have been handled better at Larnaca, but that might have been dictated by the airport rather than easyJet staff. One thing in particular struck me: the totally calm atmosphere on both flights – everyone seemed to be engrossed in or by whatever entertainment they had brought with them to pass the time, an indication perhaps that most clients know what to expect on an easyJet flight and are content with easyJet services, even if they do not bother to say so.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Liverpool to Larnaca,March 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,,5,yes,True,Liverpool,Larnaca,

Well if there is any law that allows that it should clearly be changed! Thankfully other passengers offered their place and we managed to sit close, but I found this very upsetting and the steward's answer unhelpful. On our way back, at the boarding point families with young children were offered to board with priority, but then they ask us to pay extra to sit close to our children?

This, according to many other reviews was frequently happening on this route and others. Problems occur, yes. But the lack of support and the lack of responsibility the airline took in the airport was astonishing. Compensation was offered for volunteers. But, no guarantee of a flight back within a week was given. So compensation meant nothing. Those who did choose compensation had real difficulties getting back to their connecting airports. The compensation did not cover, car parking, food, hotel accommodation etc., loss of earnings, connecting flights. easyJet simply did not handle this very well. It appears this is frequent occurrence. The airport staff told us too! I shall not fly with easyJet again. Simply put, they did not care about their customers.

People must know that when they think they are getting seats on the plane, they are only really getting a possibility of a seat. We were absolutely appalled with the fact that the company got paid twice for our seats (my wife sat in the place of someone who did not travel due to serious sickness discovered very recently, as his friends told her and both her and the friends of that person were disgusted that easyjet would not accept refunds but will happily pass that seat to someone else who paid the same money and should have their own seat). We don't understand why getting the ticket and seat is not treated a contract, but instead easyjet 'has the right' to cancel it last minute and tell you that you are not going on the plane for which you bought the ticket, not due to weather or technical problems but as a result of their greed.

It took over 4 compensation claim forms for easyJet to even respond, even then saying that we were eligible for compensation and that the money would be in our account within 15 days, it wasn’t. Phoned easyJet to get an update and see what was happening. We were then told that the second flight was delayed further due to the lightning strike. Having been in contact with some passengers on the same flight, many had already received the compensation and so I proceeded to explain this to them. He then apologised and said it was an error, and the money would be in the account within 21 day, it wasn’t. Again phoned customer service to be updated, in which I was told that the second flight was a ‘gifted free transfer’, and so compensation could not be claimed. I proceeded to explain that we had been told twice previous that we would receive the compensation. I was told this was by error and that we would not be receiving anything. I then phoned back to finally resolve the issue, and having spoken to her line manager, out of courtesy we would be transferred the compensation. Whether or not we will actually receive it this time I don’t know. ",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Luton,August 2017,4.0,4.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Munich,Luton,

An even better touch was offering FREE in-flight WiFi on the return flight, although that limits you to their own website in partnership with Rakuten, so I wouldn't bother with doing anything else.

Both at Liverpool and Palma boarding was organised efficiently and promptly, with Speedy Boarders first on and off the transfer buses. Cabin crews worked hard and the pilots kept us informed of progress. Both flights landed early. Any problems which arose were caused by those passengers who think that rules or requests are for others, not themselves, and in the process make things more difficult for both staff and their fellow passengers. We had the usual suspects ignoring the repeated advice not to put small items in the overhead lockers, so that cabin crews then spent time tactfully trying to rearrange items to allow more trundle bags to be accommodated. On the outward journey a group wearing the kit of ""UK cycle team"" were talking so loudly during the safety briefing that one of the stewardesses actually shouted ""Please pay attention"". On the return journey one of the first passengers to board at the rear of the plane then proceeded to put her bag down in the aisle to open it and take out various items, completely oblivious of the queue held up behind her.

I queued up to speak to someone about what to do and she took a few minutes to decide but after seeing my case wouldn't fit in the example box she said not to worry, that it was ok and charged me £5 instead of £47. There were a family who were infront of us who were 70 kilos over or weighed 70 kilos so had to cough up £70 there and then, so it was like they were picking and choosing who they would charge and what. Anyway, I was so relieved and happy, got on the plane all the cabin staff were really polite, helpful, friendly and the flight was fine. However on the way home, we arrived at the airport 2 hours early, all checked in online before hand too, we went to the gate on time to get ready to board but there was a huge queue so we walked 1 minute down the airport to a loo quickly. When we got back we were at the front of the queue and there were 2 girls who were meant to check our boarding passes/ID and before even saying hello or waiting for the person infront of me to walk onwards one of the girls shouted 'can you check that case, that looks massive' then looked up and me and said 'that's going to be £47, not even a hello or a please'. I obviously said how it was okay on the way and how I'd used it before with easyJet and Jet2 and she actually said 'well you havent' and I said well I have! Was ridiculous! Then they tried to tell us we were late, when we'd been waiting for 2 hours, so rude. Anyway after looking me and my friend up and down in a judgemental rude way I told them how I don't have the money and that I think it's ridiculous I could fly with it as hand luggage for £5 on the way and now they're wanting £47! At this point everyone had boarded the plane and we were told we were about to miss it, I had to make a quick call to my gran to borrow the money as the hotel we stayed in had taken a huge deposit too and I wasn't getting that back until a few days after we left, and after typing the card details wrong 4 times into her computer the rude girl finally charged me £47 and we had to sprint to the plane. They were so rude and didn't even say hello, please or thank you at any point and set completely different rules as we had on the way. So annoyed and appalled at the rude and unfair staff. After all that the flight back was fine, just dissapointed really.

At 6:45 pm we were still waiting for the flight. And suddenly a few minutes later one person came and said to everybody in the queue that he was very sorry, but our flight has been cancelled. He did not explained to us why that flight was cancelled. Everybody was very disappointed and angry. When we asked him what we can do now he said that if we want to know more information we should go and ask about some details at EasyJet information desk. Again a few minutes later we were in a big queue at the information point and again we were very disappointed. Everything what we heard there was that they have got only 2 flights to Majorca during a week (Tuesday and Friday) and all they can offer us is a leaflet with the information how to apply for refund. They also did not tell us a reason why this flight was cancelled. I was travelling for 5 hours to the airport and after that cancellation again I had to be on my way to home for 5 next hours. It was ridiculous for all passengers.  I had to cancel all our holiday because of that cancelled flight and due to that cancellation I will not get all my money from the travel agency. I am not going to book anymore a flight with EasyJet and will not recommend to anyone this airline. I am extremely disappointed and will never fly them again.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Glasgow to Palma,October 2017,,,,,5.0,,3,no,False,Glasgow,Palma,

Nobody at Olbia had informed as to anything more than they were working on the toilets on the plane. The crew visited the airport toilets walking through the departure lounge, they then went back to the plane and ascended the skies without us. This is after the captain had told us personally that he would keep us updated. Nearly 300 people wandered around the terminal at 11.30 pm looking lost and confused. I could see what was coming so I rang a hotel and booked a room. When I went outside the terminal there were no taxis due to there being no flights due until the morning. I tried phoning but were told ""No taxis""! Then one taxi appeared and took us to the hotel. Easyjet posted on their website that we could have a free flight a week later at the same time, or have a refund. We had to fly to Milan the next day to get part way home, then on to Manchester the day after that. We met some of the other passengers on the flight from Milan who told us they had to sleep on the Olbia terminal floor.

670,Lily Lim,Australia,2017-10-18,2,"✅ Verified Review  It is not easy with easyJet. At Berlin Schoenfeld Airport, the queue was extremely long and there were only 3 counters opened. Check-in staff were rude and unhelpful. I feel that the airline's main aim is to be voted ""most on time carrier"" at the expense of passengers. The app does not really work when you have more than 2 boarding passes. For example, I could see that I had 4 boarding passes on the app but I could only open 2 earlier passes. After the check-in staff also could not open the other 2 boarding passes, he issued us with paper passes, but he issued my son's pass twice and not mine causing further confusion and distress at the security gate. Overall, not happy with easyJet. But a positive point on easyJet in comparison with other budget carriers, they allow a child traveller to have a free check-in of a stroller / car seat. Also, instead of spamming with offers on hotel and car rentals, they could alert travellers on what is likely to happen at any particular airport (eg very slow security) as I am sure that they would have data on the number of passengers who missed flights.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Zurich,October 2017,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,3,no,False,Berlin,Zurich,

They made us get in line for boarding much before they were ready to board us resulting in every person getting on the flight standing in disorganized lines for at least 30 minutes. The staff who was checking me into the flight proceeded to make me pay 60 euros for my bag even though I paid extra when booking the flight to have more than one bag.

675,G Vanois,France,2017-10-06,2,"✅ Verified Review   Gatwick to Paris. I've waited 10 flights to see if things would improve - they didn't. Once you have checked in for a flight on the App, even if you change your reservation, the old boarding pass stays in the app instead of being deleted: confusing. The way to choose your seat is easy for the first flight but complicated for the return. Then you cannot change it yourself.  By the way, you can only check in until 2 hours before departure. I like to check in on the way to the airport once I know I will get my flight. No, you have to check in way before. Once, the check in with the app or via their website didn't work, so I tried to call the customer service helpline: waited 15 minutes before they answered saying they couldn't do anything. You are now on your way to the gate, it is 1/2 hour before your flight whose boarding gate is 10 minutes away. Normally no stress, not with easyjet, where they say your gate closes 25 minutes before your flight, so you run to realize it hasn't started boarding. In short, if you have a short connection, forget about your connecting flight.  You think you are better off with a more expensive Flexi fare ticket (that is what we travel with). Good thing is you could go fast lane at airport security, but in Paris at easyJet terminal there are no fast security lanes, while in Gatwick all the lanes are decently fast.  But then it is at the boarding gate that you realize how much you are robbed by speedy boarding dream: you are entitled to board first, but then you may be the one who waits the longest of all, standing in the jetway until you can board the plane.  The flight in itself is more or less OK, the staff are usually smiling, except when they bother you, at the first and emergency exit rows, to the point that you cannot have your sweater on your shoulders.  This time they bothered me saying that I needed to fold my iPad cover during the descent, in a way that I wasn't able to use the Bluetooth keyboard which is part of that iPad cover.",A319,Business,Economy Class,Gatwick to Paris,October 2017,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,,2,no,False,Gatwick,Paris,

The plane was nice, comfortable, plane was very clean and seats were fare more spacious than what I would though, as the cabin was equipped with the new Airbus seats which provide so much more knee room! I really enjoyed the colours of the cabin. Staff was very friendly and even passed with a garbage bag before landing to let passenger get rid of all there garbage, not even normal airlines do that so I was not expecting it in a low cost airline.

We were made to wait around 5 minutes at the bottom of the aircraft steps in a 30 degrees Celsius heat. Boarding was fast and we were airborne on time. Once in the air the crew started selling. I bought myself a meal deal for around £6/7 which is a good price in my opinion. The seat was not the most comfortable but bearable for this flight. Seat pitch was good for a low cost carrier. The crew were amazing, very friendly and always smiling. We landed into London Gatwick early. When disembarking the aircraft we used the jet bridge,this is something easyJet don’t normally use.

Boarding was announced a good 45 minutes before we took off but this being EasyJet, it took all of that time to get people moving onto the plane. The usual stress of a lengthy queue going nowhere, ground staff coming through to check every bag they could get their orange labels on into the hold, etc etc. Our seats were beyond uncomfortable - my partner is 6'7"" and was pretty much paralysed in place for the entire flight.

When I arrived at the boarding line, the pre-boarding was already started. So I've been asked to put a label over my luggage to put it in the hold. Apparently the number of available spaces were ended. I just would like to know why they don't simply count. They know how many speedy boarding there are. They know if they've done the check-in and if they are inside the airport. I've seen with my eyes their staff counting with paper and pen how many luggages there are. So, the question is: is it so difficult to reserve the spaces for the speedy boarding customers? They even claim that you can get an additional luggage with you and you can skip the queue. But not if you arrive a few minutes after the started pre-boarding. When they offer to buy the speedy boarding you should tell that some advantages are valid only for a few minutes. On the flight there were free spaces for luggage and a lot of them were used for something that, based on their policy, should stay under the seat. To conclude: if you just wanna go from point A to B, it can be ok easyJet. If you're expecting to pay to have a bit better service, avoid easyJet.

We were initially told that all flights to Madrid Barajas were being cancelled due to bad weather conditions, however a quick Google search confirmed that this was not true and that ours was the only cancelled flight to Madrid that day. We were escorted out of the airport to a poorly organised customer service area where we were promised by the customer service staff members that we would be refunded for our flights and reimbursed for our new flights to Madrid, transportation costs, accommodation and even food expenditure. We were told that we could not book another flight to Madrid with Easyjet until Monday the 10th (in over 3 days) as their flights were fully booked until then. This was not true, as they were still offering flights for that weekend on their website. However, we couldn’t do anything about it as their ‘support’ staff were unresponsive and dismissive, so we went back home to central London, and tried to look up affordable alternatives that would get us to Madrid in time for the music festival we had paid a lot of money to attend, and to the Airbnb that we had already paid for as well. The cheapest tickets we could find were £200 stand-by tickets (each) with Iberia, on top of the £80 each we had already paid for the Easyjet flight. After leaving Madrid, we were informed by Easyjet that they were actually not going to be refunding us the cost of the flights as their flight was cancelled due to bad weather, and they added that they could not refund our Gatwick express tickets as we sent them a copy of the bank receipt of the tickets with corresponding photos of the tickets, rather than an itemised receipt that we were not given from the station clerk. Overall, because the cancelled Easyjet flight, we had to spend: £280 per person for the flights, £35 each for the Gatwick Express, a wasted £60 on pre-booked accommodation in Madrid, and a lot of stress.

697,Christopher Rainbow,United Kingdom,2017-08-10,5,"✅ Verified Review   This review relates to a flight from Toulouse to London Gatwick in August 2017. I shall try and be candid and clear and as impartial as I can. Firstly, I found the website easy to use and clear and follow-up emails were constructive and informative. I found the Easyjet luggage charges to be very pricey. Check-in as operated in Toulouse was efficient and the staff well-presented and polite. While checking in I was aware of several elderly people struggling and no one being helped. Toulouse is often used by people travelling to and from Lourdes and as such attracts pilgrims and frail people seeking spiritual input. The flight to London was delayed by around 50 mins and passengers were herded into a waiting area. I witnessed an elderly gentleman struggle as there were no seats for him and staff ignored his pleas for help. I assisted the gentleman down a steep flight of stairs as the boarding process entailed steep stairs and then more stairs to board the flight. During the boarding of the flight only one crew member welcomed passengers and I saw 2 other crew members ignore elderly people struggling to place items into the overhead compartments. The safety demonstration as taken seriously and conducted in a professional manner. Snacks were available for purchase.

Flew Copenhagen to Paris CDG. I flew all over Europe for a month taking bargain airlines and flew easyJet three times. By far the worst airline, and when I read reviews for Flybe, it got really bad reviews but in fact that was my best flight. Two flights on easyJet were delayed, one had the worst turbulence I've experienced and we had to circle before landing, their policy on carry on bags is absurd. Every other airline if you carry a bag and a backpack you're fine but you can volunteer to check for free, but with easyJet you have to either stuff them into one or pay $60 in order to check the bag. Additionally, twice the gate was moved after waiting at the gate it was originally assigned, which could be an airport issue but since it happened at two different airports it is suspicious.

It all started when I was on my way to to the airport when I received message that plane would be 40 minutes delay and while at the airport another when it said 2 hours and 15 minutes, that was bad but OK. Plane departed 2 hours later than scheduled, but that's when fun begin, Captain told us that we might not be able to land in Berlin because airport is closing at midnight and we might not get exception which was the case so we were diverted to Rostok. We were told that buses will be waiting for us when we exit the terminal and message from EasyJet said that cabin crew will be there to assist us and will give us some food and drinks. Reality was a bit different, when we got out, there was one bus which was close and driver nowhere to be seen (we were one of the 3 aircraft) and cabin crew got into their shuttles and left, I've stopped one from other aircraft (from my already left) and she told me to ask person at the airport, there was no person at the airport. It took almost an hour until somebody came and finally let us on the bus. I could understand that things like diverting can happen, but the way EasyJet handled that is beyond terrible, I thought that cabin crew should never abandoned their passengers like this.

Hence, time spent parked in middle of road whilst he made phone calls to find out info. I repeat the 2.5 hour trip took 7 hours and 50 minutes. We were not provided with any food or drink whatsoever during this prolonged trip. No apologies were made. The little bit of information we receive was incorrect.

712,S Gardner,Singapore,2017-07-02,1,"✅ Verified Review  This is a direct return trip from London Luton Airport to Paris and back with easyJet. To be fair, the trip to Paris was ok, but the flight back was terrible, with not one, but a series of unpleasant occurrences. The problematic flight from Paris to London Luton was due to set off at 9:55pm, but was delayed by an hour and took off at 10:55pm Paris time. Despite the delay, the boarding procedures were extremely inefficient. There was no sense of urgency despite the tardiness, especially given the fact that this is such a late flight. The gate number also changed mid-way through the delayed hour. When we scanned the boarding pass, my friend was stopped by one of the staff as he was carrying two backpacks. Despite the fact some people's roller cabin luggage alone is the size of my friend's two backpacks combined, that staff insisted that my friend must pack everything into one backpack only. My friend had to step out, repack everything into one bulging, overflowing backpack before he is let through. The content brought through the gate doesn't change, the two backpacks were far from exceeding the luggage allowance in the first place, and the staff has created nothing more than sheer annoyance and further delay in our already delayed trip. The flight was around 50 minutes long and given the 1-hr time difference, reached London Luton airport at around 10:45pm London time. By this time, my friend and I were very anxious as we need to catch the 11:20pm bus from the airport to the train station, if we miss that bus, we will miss the last train home and will inevitably have to spend the night out in the streets. Just when everyone is getting their luggage from the cabin and gearing to leave, a flight announcement sounded saying that the bus to the gate will not be here for another ten minutes, and we were frustrated. Despite being late for an hour, the shuttle bus to the gate is still not scheduled on time! By the time the shuttle bus came, everyone got in, and we arrived at the gate, it was 11pm and we have barely 20 minutes to run to the customs, clear it, and dash to the bus stop. I have to run and dash through the crowd like a mad person, and we hopped onto the bus with only 2 minutes to spare. I don't think I will take easyjet again.

740,P Mallon,United Kingdom,2017-04-23,6,"✅ Verified Review   EasyJet flight EZY1821 on 19th April from Manchester to Antalya. Having travelled extensively for over 50 years, never have I experienced such appalling, intimidating and hostile behaviour as displayed by the crew on this flight. From the outset the passengers were threatened by the cabin steward and the intimidating behaviour continued throughout the flight.  Whilst I understand cabin crew do have occasional customer issues & pressures to deal with (as do all other customer facing roles) the majority of yesterday's passengers appeared to be middle aged, sensibly behaved golfers & regular, well mannered holiday makers. We were all initially warned that the crew had a ""list of passenger names"" who'd made purchases from Manchester airport duty-free and if anyone was suspected of drinking their own alcohol they would have their cabin baggage inspected and if found 'guilty' they would have the duty-free confiscated and face the prospect of arrest and a night in jail at their destination. An example was provided involving one recent passenger on a journey to Tenerife, and was conveyed as if this was a threat. One  does not generally get on a plane expecting to be spoken to like unruly school children or out of control persons. As far as I could see, most passengers were opened mouthed in astonishment by the attitude of the crew. The in-flight safety demonstration then commenced, but the steward paused it, and subsequently instructed us that if anyone was found to be not paying full attention to the safety demonstration the plane would be ""returning to the terminal and we'd be going nowhere"". Much as I fully understand the basis and sense behind both the above examples (there were many others) there are ways of politely conveying information to customers. I did not witness one passenger acting in anything but an adult and respectable manner and the behaviour of the crew was at best disrespectful and bombastic. I witnessed one stewardess referring loudly to one gentleman passenger (behind his back) as ""grandad"". Another male steward was openly verbally and sneeringly hostile towards a passenger, there seemed to be other disputes ongoing throughout the journey. When the cabin steward announced that in flight duty-free sales were about to commence we were all warned darkly about the dangers of consuming alcohol or tobacco purchased in Turkey as it could not be trusted and we would have no idea of the dangers of buying it anywhere but on board the flight (hardly conducive towards the currently struggling tourist economy in Turkey). We subsequently did not purchase anything from duty-free in protest to such slanderous remarks, nor did fellow passengers nearby. It was a relief to disembark, in the arrivals hall a large number of passengers were openly discussing how dreadful the crew had been and how unnecessary their hostile attitudes had been. I have never left a complaint on any social networking or internet website before, however on this occasion I feel sufficiently aggrieved to vent my dismay. I enjoy flying as a rule and have never come away from a journey feeling nervous of the crew. I sincerely hope we don't encounter this particular crew ever again.

However my stroller was not delivered to the aircraft at my destination - not an airport restriction as even Ryanair does this - I had to wait for my stroller more than people for their luggage (not easy with active toddler) - on the way back in Gatwick again I did not get the stroller and when I asked if it will be at the top of the sleeve was told it will not be available until baggage claim. That is a very long walk carring a toddler and waiting for passport control. I was told that 'maybe' i can find a yellow pushchair that i guess are used to lower the cost of service. None was available to anyone on this flight - not only me. If easyJet wants to use this system than i should have an option to prebook this chair or have enough available for all. Otherwise they cant claim they provide the service. - at the end again I had to wait until most of the luggage rolled off I fly a lot with my toddler - low cost and not - but never before I have had to endure this inconvenience.

The aircraft was clean and tidy.

A reasonably priced Buy On Board food and beverages service was offered twice during this 2 hour flight. The only disappointing aspect to the journey was when we arrived at a remote stand at London Gatwick. Although the bus was ready and waiting to transfer the passengers to the North Terminal, it took nearly 25 minutes for ground service personnel to arrive and position the stairs against the side of the aircraft.

Alas easyJet is not the airline it used to be. On December 23rd I flew back from Gatwick to Edinburgh, the plane due to take us was held up in Belfast by a storm. When it finally came (I was supposed to catch the 7pm plane) it was given to the passengers waiting from the delayed 5pm plane. To cut the story short the plane we finally got put on (and then sat waiting) finally reached Edinburgh after 1 am on morning of 24th Dec. This is because easyJet now juggle with planes and have too few to cover the short falls. Last night my Edinburgh plane was again delayed to Gatwick, should have been 6.55 pm and it finally got in at 9pm. One other winge is that they frequently fly you in the plane that differs from the diagram of one used to allocate tickets, twice now I have booked £10 extra for sitting in row with extra leg room over wings (Exit) and ended up in one with virtually no leg room as its a different plane. No one explains this and yet they take money paid for space.

Pilot had 2 failed attempts at landing in Gibraltar due to wind so we diverted to Malaga but after a few minutes diverted to Seville with the excuse it was windy at Malaga too. Landed at Seville and were kept on the plane for over an hour while they worked out what to do. Could not go back to Gibraltar as weather worsened. Eventually bussed back to Gibraltar which took 3 hrs and finally arrived there at 8pm instead of 11.55am. At no point were we offered a drink or food on the plane - unless we paid for it. A goodwill gesture of free food or drink would have made a huge difference. The next day we discovered that both flights after ours had landed in Gibraltar and all flights into Malaga had also landed - why couldn't our pilot? I am aware landing at Gibraltar can be hazardous and have been diverted to Malaga on one occasion a few years ago but the detour we had to endure seemed pointless and totally unnecessary. All I have had from easyjet is a text thanking me for my understanding!

As a result this time we paid an additional fee for exit row seats, which included 'speedy boarding'. Firstly, there was no speedy boarding. We had the privilege of showing our tickets at the gate ahead of other passengers, only to be kept waiting in the corridor for about 20 minutes before everyone was allowed to swarm towards the plane. We were then shocked to find our so-called 'exit row' seats were almost exactly the same as regular seats, with maybe an extra inch of legroom. I shudder to think what would happen in an actual emergency, as there would certainly be very little room for passengers to swiftly evacuate the plane this way. We endured almost as much discomfort as on previous flights, and could not believe we had been made to pay for such a joke. And as with every easyJet flight, I find it ridiculous that we have to pay for hold luggage, when on every flight I have ever taken with them somebody at the gate has announced that the plane is 'too full' for everyone's cabin baggage and invited people to check theirs in.

Not clear why the taxi took so long but we could have driven around the entire airport several times in that time. They have luggage requirements different from all other airlines. They appear to make all of their money running this luggage con. You can only have a single piece of luggage. They don't tell you during the long wait in line either. They purposely wait until you are just about to board so you don't have time to re-arrange your luggage. If you do manage to consolidate your luggage, they are waiting and ready to throw the other shoe at you: oh that luggage is too bulky and/or heavy. They charge you 60€ to check an extra bag. It is that or miss your flight. They are not even polite about it. 6 of us got caught in exactly the same way on this flight. After that, the ticket price is no longer competitive. Adding insult to injury, the luggage bins in the cabin are huge and could easily fit luggage much larger than ours and we flew with them all half empty. Nothing free is offered in flight to eat or drink. What they do sell is grossly over priced. The last straw was at the arrival, walking up and down stairs with droves of other people down long tunnels.

The plane starts to descend to land at Gatwick, wheels down and then a steep pull up, full power and we are back up, pilot then tells us that as we are so late the main runway is closed for repairs so he attempted to land on second runway but due to bad lighting and visibility he aborted landing. He was then going to circle for 15 mins while they re-opened the main runway. Next announcement was ""welcome to Stansted"". We were then told to wait on the plane while they sorted coaches for onward travel. 20 mins later were we told to make our way to arrivals for the transport home but once we were in arrivals we were then told to make our own way home (2am in the morning) and seek compensation on the EasyJet website. We eventually arrived back in Gatwick at 9am, another day off work. So far, now 22nd August, despite many calls and letters we have received no compensation, no refund of our bus fares, no explanation. EasyJet Customer Service is anything but a customer service.

We used EasyJet to book airfare from Paris-Barcelona-Paris and a week later for Paris-Napes-Paris. Trip to Barcelona was odd in that they routed us out of the terminal, onto busses, then to a plane on tarmac - similar debark in Barcelona.  Inconvenient, slow. On the return trip, an EasyJet staffer pulled us out of line, measured our bags. One bag was 1"" too long. She said only on purse or bag was allowed per passenger. We were charge 240 euros on the spot to return home. Later looking online, it is less clear about 1 bag. 1 bag/purse per passenger is general, but in many cases 1 purse and 1 carry-on bag is allowed. Very confusing.  I can embrace the concept of a low-cost carrier but be clear about what you're not offering. Not even water, soda, juice or crackers was provided. Seats do not recline. Friendly helpful service was non-existent. Staff at BCN to help with complaints did not exist either. Worse was to come. 4 hours before we were to leave for our early morning flight - we received 3am text message saying our flight was cancelled due to illness by one of the flight crew. Had I not happen to wake up and check my phone at 3:30am, we would have been totally screwed. As it was, I spent two hours in the middle of the night trying to find a last minute flight for 4 one-way tickets to Naples.  EasyJet booked the flight and return flight 1 week later. The return flight was an Air France flight. That wasn't cancelled. So, now I needed one-way tickets (expensive) and last minute (even more expensive). What did EasyJet offer in compensation? They would rebook me (at no charge) another flight to Naples or refund my purchase price for the tickets. Two issues.  Next available EasyJet flight was 5 days later (bye-bye vacation).  Value as for 1/2 round fair purchased a month ago. I will never fly EasyJet again. Wish I could rate lower than a 1. For the last kick in the pants, EasyJet also booked my rental car.

Tried to book extra legroom but was told no seats were available so despite being 6ft 4ins tall I found myself in a middle seat between aisle and window. In normal circumstances I could endure this for a short three hour flight, however, a fate would have it the seat in front wouldn't stay in an upright position - it was in a permanent reclining position - it was broken. I asked the Stewardess if there was any remedy to this situation and she told me the plane was full but she would see what she could do, which was reasonable. She seemed to forget her promise as she never came back to me so I sat with the Lady in front practically sitting on my lap. After a couple of hours I decided to visit the toilet at the front of the plane, and saw the front three seats were totally vacant. So I sat down on one of them as there was only an hour left of the flight. The Chief Stewardess rudely asked me why I was sitting there so I told her that row 16 seat was broken. She said I would have to pay extra to sit at the front so I asked her if I would get a refund for sitting in the broken seat for the previous two hours - she said not and that I would have to return to my broken seat. As a matter of principle I refused to pay extra for the last hour of the flight and returned to Row 16. On my return home I sent a complaint to Easyjet on 29th May. I received the following response right back ""Dear easyJet Customer Thank you for contacting easyJet via our online form. We aim to reply to you within 3days, although in busy periods this may be longer. We’ll be in touch soon. Regards, easyJet Customer Services"". That was on 29th May 2016 - it is now 3rd August 2016, almost ten weeks later and I haven't heard anything more from Easyjet. Seems they must be very busy with complaints which doesn't surprise me one little bit.

Most airlines have allowed one small bag and one overhead bag, so while we still have all of that luggage, we have to pay for what they already have space for on their flight. Furthermore, once we had boarded the flight, we noticed ample space in all of the overhead luggage compartments for the bags while they had specifically said at the gate that due to the full flight, they could not fit our baggage. They charge you for all food and beverages as well. The policies this airline holds are frankly absurd as they try to rip you off. Definitely not worth what you pay for. They advertise themselves as a cheap airlines while instead you will probably have to pay the price of a much nicer flight. However, they do leave on time and their boarding process goes quickly.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,ORY to NCE,July 2016,3.0,3.0,1.0,,4.0,,2,no,False,ORY,NCE,

Dreading the long wait for our flight my partner suggested we go to the airport and ask if we could change our flight. I was quite adament that this could not be done unless you paid either over the odds or paid for another seat. We went to the airport and asked the member of staff at the easy jet desk if we could change our flight. She replied of course and had us on the eariler flight leaving at 5.40pm. This was done in the space of 5 minutes and no extra cost at all. We were delayed going out and coming back but not for long and these are things that cannot be helped.

Over the years, I could see a great deal of improvement in the service, food and aircraft. To begin with, there were three toilets on the plane that took us to Lanzarote and back, all of which had baby changing stations. The food was much better this time around than on any other flight. We opted for the meal deals, and were really impressed with the Corkers crisps and the hot food. They were far tastier than any other on-flight food I've had in over 10 years of flying with state-owned and low-cost airlines. The staff was very attentive, helping me with my baggage, and making sure that I'm aware of the facilities and safety features dedicated to infants. The flight attendants forgot to serve us some of the food, and it took about 15 minutes for the hot food to be served, but that's not something we'd hold against them, considering they were genuinely busy. There was a general sense of calm and consideration for other people, with passengers willing to overlook the noise and fuss our children made, and I believe that's down to how the staff carried themselves and attended to people's needs. There was a friendly atmoshpere throughout, which helped ease our anxieties over political unrest in the country, and especially attitudes toward migrants. The new Recaro seats are very comfortable and sleek, with plenty of legroom behind and underneath.

Easyjet also tell passengers that they will more likely get their cabin bags in the overhead locker space if they try to board early, we paid for speedy boarding and were amongst the first passengers on board, safely put our bags (smaller than most) in the overhead lockers, yet a guy boards almost last couldn't get his large case in the lockers so the flight attanedant takes mine out and tells me to put it under the seat in front of me, severely restricting space for my feet for the whole flight.

On 28 Feb 2016 I was supposed to take a flight from Naples to Paris Orly. Unfortunately this was cancelled due to the weather conditions. Ground staff did all they could to help passengers. We were told to come back the next morning for a new flight scheduled at 9.55. This flight finally departed after 13.00. The reason given by the captain (in Italian and English - translated into French by a stewardess) was that an emergency slide had to be repaired before departure and that he was waiting for the final paperwork. Result was a near 22 hour delay on arrival in Paris. I accept this misfortune could happen with any airline. What I do not accept is that on 15 June I am still waiting for the reimbursement of my out of pocket expenses and that EasyJet have claimed that they do not owe any compensation under European legislation as the flight was delayed due to weather conditions - that was the case for the original flight, but not for the replacement flight. By way of comparison following a mechanical failure on a Flybe flight compensation was finalized within 24 hours. As a result of this experience I have learned to NO longer have any faith in EasyJet and in future shall do all in my power to avoid this airline and to warn potential flyers about their poor after sales service (plenty of bla-bla, but no action).",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,NAP to ORY,February 2016,2.0,4.0,1.0,,3.0,,1,no,False,NAP,ORY,

Boarding was quick and we left a few minutes early, which is a bonus. The cabin crew were friendly and the aircraft was clean and comfortable. We arrived at Gatwick 5-10 minutes early, and disembarking was as quick as boarding. On the way back, we were about half an hour early landing, which was fantastic.

When the time comes to board the plane we get the news that takeoff has again been delayed because the plane had reached its weight limit. The flight attendants went around offering passengers trips to different destinations in order to get them off the plane to decrease the weight. After a few passengers left, we got yet another call from the cockpit informing us that we will not be landing in Paris, but in Milan to refuel.  In a matter of minutes we were airborne. Its worth mentioning that the cabin crew had the decency to offer complimentary beverages and snacks to make up for the inconvenience. The food was average, simple meals most of which are sandwiches that I do enjoy. The seats on the flight were uncomfortable. The distance between the seats was insufficient lacking legroom which made the flight uncomfortable. We arrive at Milan only to hear more bad news, we were told that the plane had hit a bird, which meant that we had to change planes. To summarise the story, we arrived at Paris CDG after an 8 hour flight, exactly double the amount of time it should have taken. We had lost half of a day on our short trip, arriving at 5:30am local Paris time instead of 12:30am.

I am still waiting. In my opinion, this company charges just slightly less for flights than the national airlines because they do not spend money on customer services.

The latest ETD was 23.35 with ETA 00.10 and ATD was 11.31. We landed safely in Lyon, because they mentioned that GVA airport was already closed at midnight and we were not informed before.

We missed our train connection because of the delay and we arranged last minute bus travel which we missed as well due to the arrival was in Lyon.

908,Veronica Nolan ,United Kingdom,2016-02-23,6,"I didn't expect much as it was the 2nd time I flew with easyjet. The first was in 1997. It hasn't improved much in terms of Customer Service. I have avoided it this long but it was inevitable this time around as I wasn't paying for the trip myself so I had budget constrain. Flew from London Gatwick to Lisbon. Let's start with the booking process. This was easy and straightforward, living up to its name. However, the additional charges for bags and seats (although I knew about it) still irked me. It really should be standard. How can any airline charge their customers for choosing where to sit? Afterall, we are already paying to fly. The bags - less said. Anyway, the London Gatwick experience was so-so. If you're not an easyJet Plus customer you can't bring anything else apart from one cabin bag-not even a small handbag. I think this is just ridiculous. A handbag is like a 5th limb for most people. Having said that, when returning, the staff at the boarding gate in Lisbon terminal 2 (budget airlines only terminal), allowed the passenger in front of me to carry her handbag which was almost as big as her cabin bag. She wasn't an easyJet Plus customer as those who were went through another lane. She was told to queue like we all were. This inconsistency is what lets easyJet down. I have to say, their pilots on both leg of the journey were brilliant. High winds, but not a bump when landing. The bag drop process in Gatwick was smooth. The one in Lisbon was so-so (might have to do with it being a budget terminal). Calling you to the gate 45 minutes before departure and then to go through passport control was a very silly set-up. It meant everyone was anxious and rushing and in a bad mood. But that's the termnal's fault. Easyjet - if I have the means, I would never fly it. The only other airline worst than easyjet is Ryanair (which I flew with once 20 years ago and never again).",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LGW to LIS,February 2016,3.0,4.0,,,3.0,,3,no,False,LGW,LIS,

My companion and I had booked separately and I had selected seats and chose to take cabin baggage only. Both our bags were hard cases of less than regulation size. We arrived at the gate to be told that our bags would have to be checked in (no charge) a bit annoying but not really a problem. We took our seats having noticed the lockers crammed full with cases which in no way were regulation size or less. Again annoying but not worth making a fuss over. Then, we were informed that due to the baggage conveyor going wrong, all the hold bags had to be moved manually so a delay was inevitable. This is when the hard seat with my knees under my chin became an issue. For the 1.5 hour flight I was prepared to suffer but the extra hour made it a bit torturous. Coming back on the 25th, the flight was overbooked and again, people were asked to put luggage in the hold. We kept our cases as I suspect the reclaim at Gatwick would have been a much longer wait than at Montpellier which was very quick. The queuing system at the gate was a bit farcical and disorderly. Because we had no priority boarding, it was difficult to find anywhere for our cases due again, in no uncertain way to the lockers being overstuffed with oversize luggage. The cabin staff were very helpful and fitted our bags in further down the cabin. I felt sorry for the staff having to put up with quite a few unpleasant comments from other travellers.

918,R Mercer,Spain,2016-01-26,3,"During my recent flight from Spain, where I live, to Gatwick for the weekend I experienced appalling treatment at the hands of Easyjet staff. As we were about to board the plane we were asked to demonstrate that our bag would fit in the cage. This was an irritating request seeing as we had flown with the bag a dozen times, but nonetheless one I acceded to in good humour, courtesy and without protest. In the interests of saving time I placed the bag in the cage, but did not push it all the way down. The first two wheels glided in seamlessly, but the last two wheels were left protruding out of the cage by about 1 inch, but only as I had not pushed the bag down as it should have been obvious it fitted. The Easyjet employee simply stated ""right, it doesn’t fit it will have to be checked in"". There was no attempt to be helpful and suggest I get the last two wheels in and no application of common sense that dictated that if the first two wheels fitted, then the last two logically also must. It was not said with even a modicum of courtesy and she walked away from me while she was talking. I went back to the desk where she rudely informed me I had to pay £45 for it to be checked in. Understandably shocked and frustrated at my appalling public treatment I refused, to which she replied ""well you won’t be flying then"". I was utterly flabbergasted at how brusquely I was being spoken to. At this point she directed me, again curtly, to her manager. Her manager displayed a similar lack of professionalism and contempt for us, talking to me as though I were an errant child that should have known better. I pointed out that we had flown out on Friday with the bag, to which she responded that she didn’t know if I really did as I may have checked it in, the logical inference being I was lying. I pointed out that she could look up my flight records and see that I had not checked in any luggage, to which she responded that I might have swapped the bag while in the UK over the weekend. The stupidity of this statement needs no explanation. She reiterated that I would not be flying if we refused to pay. I suggested there was an issue with Easyjet staff training seeing as I had flown with the bag a dozen times and never experienced any problems, to which she contemptuously explained to me that her staff were excellently trained in these matters. At this point both my girlfriend and I were exhausted with the ridiculousness of it all. My girlfriend offered to demonstrate to the manager that the bag did fit, which the manager flippantly accepted, clearly certain that her ""well trained"" staff couldn’t possibly have made an error. The bag went all the way into the cage and the manager’s response was simply ""ok, yes it can go in with you"". We received no apology. She simply walked off and carried on with her work. I even had to ask for our passports back. I would also like to point out that on the flight out we were told there was no room in the overhead bins (there was) and we had to check it in. Perhaps I should have charged Easyjet £45 for doing so. Is this really the level of professionalism and customer service I can expect from Easyjet? This is easily the most appalling treatment I have received as a customer.

I don't ask for much on short flights of this nature apart from a reasonably on time departure and arrival, so I am rarely moved to write a review.

We were sitting in an aisle and middle seat on row two, Once everyone was on board, I noticed none of the front row seats were occupied so I asked if we could move forward one row to allow my wife to have a window seat. The young man said no because we would have to pay an ""upfront fee"" to do so. However, we already had easyJet plus because we had reserved row two seats. Okay, he was sticking strictly to the rules but it seemed a bit mean when no-one else was sitting there. However, there was no excuse for this easyJet flight attendant actually shouting from his seat at a passenger sitting behind me. There appeared to be some confusion over whether the passenger was using a child seatbelt properly. At this stage the aircraft was still above the clouds, the undercarriage had not been lowered and the pilot had not given cabin crew the warning that landing was imminent. There was therefore no reason why he could not have left his seat and spoken to the passenger in a polite manner. Instead, he yelled: ""Excuse me Sir"" at the top of his voice before the young lady sitting beside him nudged him and pointed out the seatbelt was, in fact, properly activated. There was no apology.

Then it all turned pear shaped. The Captain told us there would be a maximum delay of 1hr 10mins because of computer issues at Brest air traffic control. We finally set off 1.5 hrs later with no further warnings or explanations. We had paid for extra leg room seats, but were not warned that for the person sitting nearest the window in row 1 (the only extra leg room seats) was limited by the slide stowage, so it was only okay if you had no left leg! The seats were like church pews, upright and uncomfortable and to add to our misery they did not recline even one notch! This despite the stewardess telling us at each take off and landing that we must ensure our seats are upright! After about 1.5hrs the feeling in our legs was replaced by the pain of biting cold. We were told no blankets could be supplied because it is a budget airline and people steal them and anyway we should know and bring our own. Cabin service was curt to the point of rudeness, rather than efficient. The descent into Funchal was extremely turbulent we experienced a ""missed approach"" due to the cross winds being outside the aircraft's limits. We briefly joined a holding pattern, but were diverted to Gran Canaria. We were later told this was because there was insufficient fuel to wait and make a second attempt. As it was now nearly six hours since we last ate, we asked for some food. We were told they could not serve hot food now and anyway all the food would have gone off and not be fit to eat! Instead they handed out complementary pringles/crisps and plastic cups of water! After at least an hour, the pilot decided to return to Funchal make another attempt to land. If that failed he would take us to ""mainland Europe."" The descent was much smoother and the landing was achieved. We finally landed 5 hrs after our allotted time at 12.20am! It was a relief to disembark after 9hrs on the aircraft. Fortunately, our car hire had stayed open for our flight, so we were able to get ourselves to a hotel and find a room for the night, as it was now too late to pick up the key to the apartment we were renting. We have since discovered that earlier flights by other airlines took their passengers to other islands and paid for overnight accommodation. Easyjet made no attempt to even make sure we were able to find and get to accommodation at that late hour - there being no taxis at the airport! Whilst the circumstances were not all the fault of Easyjet, and, indeed, we had expected problems with the landing, this airline made a bad situation many times worse by their appalling attitude and shoddy service.

At LGW, one check-in assistant was telling all women they couldn't take both a handbag and a trolleybag into the cabin, causing a scrum at the gate while dozens of female passengers frantically tried to squash their bags inside their suitcases. The other check-in assistant wasn't remotely bothered however, and as I was in her queue, I sailed through with both my bag and case. Having a bit of time to kill at EDI coming back, I noticed that easyJet have a strange policy of asking passengers on almost every departing flight to volunteer to put their cabin baggage into the hold. Towards the end of the boarding queue, this no longer becomes voluntary, as happened to my two travelling companions who were told their bags would be tagged and taken away from them on the tarmac. This is infuriating if you have had liquids confiscated at security, for example, or have a tight onward connection to make. If the aircraft isn't big enough to accommodate hand luggage for every passenger then easyJet need to revise their policy, making checked luggage much more affordable (or free) rather than wasting boarding time by taking people's bags off them.

972,Liz Smith,United Kingdom,2015-10-20,10,We recently travelled Glasgow to Malaga return. Unfortunately at the start of our return journey our hire car let us down and we had to telephone roadside assistance. This resulted in as arriving at Malaga Airport 25 minutes before our return flight was due to take off. After many apologies to other passengers for queue jumping and running underneath barriers we reached the bag drop desk and the Easyjet representative told me to run with my luggage as I had already checked in on line. She said she was not sure we would make it but encouraged us to go for it. We were held up slightly at security as due to our earlier encounters with the car I had omitted to remove a bottle of water from my hand luggage! This resulted in us leaving security 10 minutes before departure and with a heavy heart and heavy bags we run through duty free to the departure gate. The Easyjet representative made a quick call on the radio and told us to run as quickly as we could down the airbridge. Staff efficiently tagged our luggage and on we went - departing Malaga on time. Had we not received the very high level of customer service and assistance from the Easyjet staff in Malaga we would not have made it home to Glasgow on Sunday. ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Malaga to Glasgow,October 2015,3.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,,5,yes,False,Malaga,Glasgow,

I would say nearly all if not all passengers were from the north west, and even though we were cooped up, passengers were annoyed and fed up, but there was still a good banter amongst the passengers.

I have never been to Bristol airport and asked at the easyJet desk where I needed to go (myself and family already had 'speedy boarding cards') - the assistant on the desk spoke to me like I was something she had trod in saying in a cold manner 'You don't need to be here, you don't have luggage do you? , just go up the stairs over there'. So I went to the Aspire Lounge until the TV screen showed which Gate I needed to be at to board my flight home. When the screens did show me where my gate was, the time was 15.45 at gate 15,  so we made our way towards the gate. I happened to spot a sign on a wall that said it was a seven minute walk from this sign to gate 15.  Whilst walking down the corridor I was watching the info screens and noticed that gate 15 had changed from 'boarding' to 'closing' - the time on the screen was 15.51. Everyone on that now started to run down the corridor in fear that they would not make the flight. My elderly parents were flying with me and my mother is asthmatic so she cannot run or even walk quickly. How is anyone supposed to make a flight when they are not given enough time to comfortably walk a route. Everyone was complaining about this and the staff just shrugged their shoulders and said in a muttered tone 'You got here didn't you?'. That is not the attitude I expect from a professional company. This was my first experience of an easyJet flight and it will also be my last. My advice to Bristol easyJet staff is to remember your customers pay your wages, treat them with respect and have a friendly attitude.
