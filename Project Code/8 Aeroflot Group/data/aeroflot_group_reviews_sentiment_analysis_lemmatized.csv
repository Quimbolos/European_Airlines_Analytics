3,S Gorsey,United Kingdom,2022-01-30,5,"Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.

6,J Giryena,Austria,2021-09-21,2,"I missed my flight due to a confusion with the flights in the airport (Moscow SVO) - when two flights of Aeroflot were scheduled to the same destination with a difference of approx. 20 minutes, but one of them was not shown on the departure board (for some unknown reason). As a result I missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate. Other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight. When I approached the customer desk in Moscow with my issue of a missed flight I still had three more connecting flights left in my round trip ticket. They informed me that the whole ticket was cancelled. It took them months to respond after and no support was provided with regard to my cancelled flights. How about the so called bonus miles program? Apparently it's not even possible to spend them in any way if you haven't reached 3000 miles.

17,B Anastasia ,Australia,2020-11-02,1,"My flight was cancelled by Aeroflot back in April. We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Tokyo via Moscow,April 2020,,,,,,,1,no,False,Rome,Tokyo,Moscow,Negative,-0.3436,  cancel back april call multiple time throughout april may june promise refund full amount obviously whether take reasonable expect full refund however refund never provide tried send multiple message customer service well response last week try call customer service pay international call representative australia live customer service extremely poor honest encounter poor attitude year extremely frustrate customer service representative properly address issue say two option voucher reissue new ticket well live russia europe absolutely way use option reason buy ticket transfer time convenient way rome tokyo intend visit russia explain nothing willing continue quote new russian legislation come effect half year buy ticket ask explain come promise refund previously hold wait month month option explain say submit complain feedback section explain tried communicate issue feedback section already get response say help ask connect supervisor reason first time ever speak customer service manager supervisor basically company decide keep money pay go ahead customer service care lose lot money international call without resolution situation absolutely ridiculous unacceptable every booked cancel flight provide refund ago despite understand struggle moment accept voucher australian use living australia ca use voucher ticket cheap ticket either refundable outrageous get money back ticket refundable pay premium refundable option receive refund send another message follow call receive response voucher pretty much copy paste customer service templates care customer reputation exploit situation hold customer cash long possible indefinite

25,S Valkinas,Lithuania,2020-06-23,1,"Vilnius to Tokyo via Moscow in January 2020 was a nightmare because my luggage was damaged and I spent about a month contacting them for compensation and I've got none. Nonetheless, customer support at Moscow airport doesn't care. While people were rushing and had urgent questions, all 3 women at the counter just put a ""break 15min"" sign and left. I had a ticket back to Lithuania on June 6th from Tokyo, through Moscow. I knew that the flight will be canceled because Lithuania embassy information was 100% sure that borders will be closed for traveling from Moscow until July 1st. However, when I called airline, they said that it's not true, and they are not sure about that, I still canceled my flight, because I always buy flights with cancelation option. (Flight was officially canceled just a couple days before the departure). Their policy says that return takes around 10 working days. Its been a month and all they say is Wait.

Cabin staff were friendly and warm and accommodated all requests and did everything with confidence and style. All were also immaculately attired and turned out. For a three hour flight, not overly long, they got in three services, a food run, then tea and coffee and duty free and made it look easy. I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside. No IFE but to be expected on short haul regional commutes and didn't phase me and didn't expect any. So my overall experience with Aeroflot from Bucharest to Moscow return, was outstanding and enjoyable and I can't think of anything to mark down.

48,S Nilsson ,Sweden,2019-11-27,2,"Aeroflot has two faces. When things run smoothly, they are okay, but when you have a problem with them, they are a pure disaster. I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation.

61,Aleksandra A. Nikiforova,Russian Federation,2019-09-13,2,"Moscow to Nalchik. I flew abroad with many foreign companies, but I never saw that the registration of passengers and baggage was so slow (my granddaughter and I stood in line for at least 50 minutes, despite the fact that the line was not so long). For all the time in the queue there was not a single announcement about the beginning or end of check-in for flights, which I initially did not pay attention to, but which probably played a decisive role in what happened. Having pre-registered online, I did not manage to check in my luggage until the end of registration. When it was my turn, they suggested that I fly without baggage. As a result, my granddaughter, 14 years old, who had no luggage, flew out alone, while I reissued a ticket at the ticket office the next day (August 8), for which I paid 5520 rubles. In addition to me, other people with similar stories crowded around the ticket office and they all asked the same questions: “Why don't they announce the end of registration? Why are company employees working so slowly?” I want to ask one more question: ""Why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane, but there is no time to complete the registration?""

73,N Ganthan,United States,2019-08-07,1,"New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow,June 2019,,,,,1.0,,1,no,True,New York,Tel Aviv,Moscow,Negative,-0.9759,  new york tel aviv via moscow june 2019 bad experience jfk svo continually delay without explanation though boarding time never change board hour late get 80 minute sit without sort communication staff happen eventually claim try solve mechanical issue continue sit later hear airport staff comment idea board passenger clearly solve issue begin make matter bad despite take new york many american passenger board announcement make russian get need wait 3 hour notify status wait almost 2 hour cancel fact admit cancel instead claim delay full 24 hour many passenger include upset frustrated end complete botching seem planned response scenario herd us upstairs claim luggage us wait obscenely long line check two staff member claim updated ticket hotel voucher already delay hour wait line least additional hour bad part whole disaster claim rebooking anyone technically cancel delayed accord reasonable airline release ticket cancel one effectively clearly passenger rebook flight able get around delay staff hand new ticket hotel voucher quite rude display sympathy customer treat poorly already understand deal many angry customer still least apologized behalf sure enough though program tel aviv require presence delay arrival rebook lucky enough travel agent trip able demand rebook another lot frustration part require rush another airport whole night sleep entire experience handle poorly unprofessionally begin end never fly
74,F Larenez,United States,2019-07-30,4,"Madrid to Guangzhou via Moscow. I would just like to say that the way this airline schedules this flight is a recipe for stress and disaster. A friend of mine flew the same route and had the same thing happen to her. She had given me a heads up that I would have to go from one end of the Moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight. She also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive. She knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before I did. The flight from Madrid to Moscow flight 2501 arrives at 5:50 PM at terminal D. Then you have to get though security to get to terminal F in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 7:05 PM from gate 57 at terminal F, which is the second to the last gate. I literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight. If I had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line I would have missed my flight. Once I arrived in Guangzhou, I was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day. So, why have a route so tight that will cause passenger's luggage to always arrive a day late? If the airline is going to keep this schedule, they need to at least warn passengers that their luggage will arrive late and warn them that if they want to make their connecting flight they need to RUN to make it on board.

Since I arrived with an international flight (SU2193 / SU2694) and continued my trip with a domestic one (SU1644 / SU1637) via Sheremetyevo Airport (and the new B terminal) I was quite worried about not receiving my luggage – which proved to be a needless worry.

As a Frequent Flyer (GoldMember) with Aeroflot for nearly 3 years, all I can say is that I'm very satisfied with them. Flight Attendants are genuinely welcoming and helpful, aircraft (usually Airbus) are recent, seats have a generous width & legroom (Frequent Flyers are entitled to a Space+ Seat with extra leg room, free of charge), food & wines onboard and in the business lounges are good and prices are overall competitive. You may sometimes have a flight delayed (snow at Moscow Airport in the winter, etc) - but I've experienced that Aeroflot will never let you down. They will provide drink, lunch, even hotel, and next available flight. A few months ago my flight from Bangkok to Paris was delayed, Aeroflot put me on the Thai Airways direct flight in the same day / evening and gave me a 4 star hotel + meals for the 8 hours waiting time. Moscow Airport is good, and has everything you need - restaurants, cafés, bars, hotels, wifi, vending machines.

With 3 kids this was absolutely one of the worst travel experiences, especially since I paid for business class to have the comfort.

82,W Haston,United States,2019-06-27,1,"Last week my wife and son flew Aeroflot with a 1hr 20 min connection through Moscow Sheremetyevo. The flight from Almaty touched down in Moscow on time, but passengers had to wait 20 minutes for the terminal bus to arrive. The stewardess assured my wife that if the connecting flight was missed, ""they will give you seats on the next flight."" The plane was served by only one bus, so everyone had to wait for all passengers on the plane to disembark before the bus ever left for the terminal. Transit passengers in Terminal D must pass through a security and passport control check before entering the terminal. By the time my wife and son cleared the security check, the boarding gate for their connecting flight to JFK had closed. Nevertheless, they made all haste to the departure gate, hoping they would be allowed to board, but they were too late. Aeroflot agents told my wife that the missed connection was her fault and she would have to pay full fare for the onward journey, more than $1,700. My wife had only a little over $900 on her card. I transfered the money to my wife's card so she could buy her and my son's ticket. This kind of mistreatment goes far beyond bad customer service.

It took 8 days to finally get my bags (my trip was only 12 days long). During those 8 days I sent emails, faxes and called the airline and lost baggage service (Q.A.S) multiple times and never received any responses. The only reply I got from them was due to a Facebook message I sent, which explained I need to contact the airline directly, not through their FB page. On April 24th I decided to go to the airport and look for my bags myself. They claimed my bags were not there, but I begged to check on my own and was finally allowed. Well, they were sitting right there in their storage room! It seems that when the bags finally made it on a flight, they had new tags put on - meaning the airline would have never found my bags, since they were searching for my old tag number. When no one claimed the bags, instead of searching their system to look for my claim, they issued a new claim to the case even though my name was on the baggage tag!

105,S Guryenev,Denmark,2019-03-22,2,"I was flying from Copenhagen to Saint Petersburg via Moscow. With all flights on the route being served by Aeroflot. I had only 75 minutes to change in Sheremetyevo. Why do you let the booking systems to sell the tickets with such a small time to connect. It's barely enough if the flight is on time - but, in my case, the Aeroflot flight from Copenhagen was delayed by 25 minutes. I have to say a few words about the official ground representatives of Aeroflot in Copenhagen. It was hustle and bustle, with lots of unnecessary movements. They made an impression of low professionalism. So the flight from Copenhagen departed with 25 minutes delay. The cabin crew on the flight CPH-SVO was also very hectic. I asked for a coffee and they poured me a warm liquid which barely resembles coffee. When I've told the lady about it and asked for the tea (if it's warm) I was met with very unfriendly face. The food had become very poor lately. I missed my connection to Saint Petersburg, I was rebooked for the next time, but barely had time to catch it. So if you travel via Moscow's Sheremetyevo you have to have at least two hours for the transfer. I arrived in Saint Petersburg's Pulkovo airport with the next Aeroflot's flight, but my luggage didn't, it arrived two flight later almost at midnight. The ground service of Pulkovo airport offered me to wait for my luggage two and a half hours. They offered me to fill in some papers and lied that if I will put 24 hours contact permission, it will simply mean, that they will have a right to send me sms 24/7, in fact, I later figured out that it meant that they can deliver my luggage 24/7. The next day I call to Pulkovo luggage service to ask about my luggage delivery, and they inform me that I will only get it from 20:00 to 8:00, at night.

120,Mats Strandberg,Russian Federation,2019-01-20,5,"Murmansk to Moscow. I have been flying Aeroflot frequently since 1995 and clearly seen the huge improvement taking place during that period. I am a Gold Member of Aeroflot Bonus and have been that several periods during my 11 years membership of the program. It is with disappointment that I note a decline in customer centricity since 2013-2016. Especially the last 2 years the airline have become a “paragraph referring airline”. Instead of being flexible with access to lounges for Gold and Platinum members with one guest (spouse) and child (non-teenager), they follow their rules and deny access in most of the cases. Big difference compared to few years ago. The same rigidity to upgrades to Space Plus in economy class, even with half empty planes. Snacks on short flights (1-3 hours) has been the same boring dark bread sandwich for over a year. When flying 6-8 flights per month, this sandwich loses its attraction after a few months. No variation at all. When addressing these issues to Aeroflot Bonus customer feedback desks, the same mechanical defense explanations appear, stating that “crew is just following rules” and do nothing wrong - or, “thanks for your quality feedback on meals, we will review this”, but nothing happens. Aeroflot until a year ago, was an airline I strongly supported and actually also promoted as much better than the reputation, but my experience in 2017-2019 have been flavored with negative impressions. Especially rude and negligent response on claims, from staff at airports and customer feedback centers.

121,Michelle Poulter,Hong Kong,2019-01-16,1,"London to Hong Kong via Moscow. My daughter flew with Aeroflot and due to horrendous queues at passport check and security, a connecting flight was missed in Moscow. She alerted staff at security check and was told to push to the front. Other passengers pushed her back shouting that they too were about to miss their flights. WIFI is almost impossible to use at Moscow, so without communications she was  very upset to have missed her flight. The staff at the airport were rude and unhelpful telling her it was her fault that she missed the connection, however with hundreds of other people all missing connecting flights it would appear not. She had to queue for another hour just to talk to customer service. With no other options, we had to book her another ticket at considerable expense and then told that her return flight was invalid, due to her missing the connecting flight. So yet another expense booking her flight home. One of the busiest times of the year, you can imagine how much money we have spent on these flights. Response from customer service took exactly 1 month. A long winded message to say, she checked in at Heathrow accepting the transit time and ticket conditions, so there is nothing they will do.

The second flight was ok and normal, but the first one are both good and bad. Good point: Seat was really good, very wide and comfortable. I can lay down in a much bigger angle than economy and there is a footrest come out from below the seat. Food was really proper food.

As an Elite Plus member in Skyteam from another company (Not Aeroflot), I can also enjoy the lounge from Beijing and lounge from Moscow. I attached the photo of moscow lounge, very good food, not very crowded. Negative points: Food was good, but too much salt in the main course. But overall is ok. When I check in at Beijing airport, and showed to the desk my Elite Plus member card, to use the priority checkin desk, lounge voucher, and priority luggage delivery. The girl in the counter spent around 5 mins to call China Eastern to validate if my Elite Plus membership are real. On the phone, she said my account number and my name, and ask if the name matches and which level is this number, even I already showed to her my physical membership card and also the online checkin result already showed I am ElitePlus. I asked why and she told me because many people are using fake cards and account number from other people to get the privilege for free, they have to double check manually. I can't believe they have to check it in this way, wasting time for everybody. They should have an easy IT solution through Skyteam.

133,M Shamari,Malaysia,2018-12-19,10,"Prague to Ho Chi Minh via Moscow. Having seen negative reviews, we (two adults, three kids 3-10 yo) decided to leave a review here too because we found the airline was excellent in many aspects. Check-in: no hick-up. It was opened two hours before flight, maybe due to Prague's policy, not airline. We wish the airport/airlines may consider this as we found the immigration at Prague was excruciatingly slow, almost deliberately by the staff who manned the counter. We were asked numerous questions and he perused through each passport very slowly without apparent reason. We made it to the flight a few minutes after boarding time had closed despite being number four to check-in. A few travellers were also late behind us.Thankfully Aeroflot waited for us! Our baggage were checked in all the way to Ho Chi Minh where we collected each of them safely. Food: We requested Muslim food. As the PRG-MOW was below 3 hours, special meal request could not be entertained (Aeroflot's policy). This is an aspect which the airline could improve. We came well-prepared with outside food and were not told off by the steward/ess. Orange juice was particularly nice. From MOW to SGN, we were provided with Muslim meal in a very well-presented boxes. It came with halal certification information booklet by a Russian halal authorisation agency. This is much better than the handwritten or sticker of MOML as in other airlines. Aeroflot scores highly from us for ensuring total confidence over the food that they serve. In flight magazine: They certainly have listened to complaints and we are happy to report that they have an in-flight magazine in English, in addition to the thick Russian one. Good job Aeroflot! We now have Nov and Dec 2018 issues as part of our collection! In flight entertainment: Aeroflot may have the largest selection of movies to watch in addition to excellent games for kids. They also have good selection of local (Soviet and Russian) hits. Every passenger was supplied with earphones. The quality of the screen and audio was excellent. 5. For kids, they received two different sets of bag/toy/stationeries/games for the two legs of travel. Very nice bag that my youngest keeps wearing everyday even after a week off the plane! Very nice touch from the Aeroflot! 6. Cabin crew were polite and gentle enough throughout the flight, at check in counter and when speaking with the kids. Amenities on board were also good including blanket, socks, soft slippers and eyemask on the MOW-SGN. Overall cabin experience was great. The flight was warm, clean and spacious enough with reclining seats, and lift-able armrest, allowing my kids to sleep on my laps. Overall Moscow Sheremetyevo experience was excellent. Immigration was polite and quick. Airport facilities were great. There is even a family room at Terminal D which could be booked for free to up to 24hrs by a family that has at least one <7 yo. It has beds for small kids and sofas for older ones, a playing room, nappy changing room, basic kitchen (for warming baby foods and hot water) and private toilet. It is manned by a personnel who just need to be shown the passports and boarding passes. We used 12 flights for this particular trip, and Aeroflot scored highest.

Basic things like what's next or where to meet, all not clearly explained. The information given was very limited. Staff attitude extremely bad and arrogant.

149,K Manar,Mexico,2018-09-13,1,"I used Aeroflot to travel from Havana to Istanbul return with a connecting flight in Moscow. Both of the experiences were horrible. First, they departed around 40 min late from Havana which caused me and several other passengers miss the connecting flight from Moscow to Istanbul.

157,Ivan Nikitin,Russian Federation,2018-08-08,4,"Moscow to Istanbul. Aeroflot is definitely not a premium airline it thinks it is, because their economy experience is simply embarrassing. Moscow - Istanbul was on a 5-year old Boeing 737-800, but the cabin looked like it was 15 years old with no maintenance. Everything was scuffed, slightly teared, shaky etc. The seats were unbelievably, and I mean it, unbelievably tight. It was seriously painful to sit upright in the seat, because if you are of average height, your knees will be firmly pressed into the hard and rough metal bar, which is conveniently located right where your knees are supposed to be. The fact that the armrests were quite wide made the seat even less spacious. I lucked out in not having a neighbour in the next seat, but I seriously doubt it I would have handled the flight if it was 100% full. The cabin crew were grumpy and sloppy (with one exception), and their attitude regarding safety was unbelievable - they just didn't care. They never properly checked the cabin before take off and failed to enforce the safety rules (since they cared so little), so the plane took off with open tray tables, closed windows, passengers laying across the seats with no seatbelts, passengers streaming something from their devices with no headphones. I have never experienced anything like this, I felt like this was a bad dream or a good comedy, but it was neither. The meal service was alright. I ordered a kosher meal, which is always a fine choice on Aeroflot, and it was much bigger than the regular meals. Nothing extraordinary, plastic cutlery, no menus, but it was fine. There was no wine, beer or any other alcohol onboard, not even for purchase, which is just so embarrassing for the ""best airline of Eastern Europe"". I must also note that their main full-service competitors on this route - Turkish Airlines and Atlasglobal - both serve beer and wine, and their meals are much tastier. There was no entertainment onboard. You could apparently stream entertainment via their wi-fi network, but it kept failing. The landing in Istanbul was really rough, and then the plane spent 20 minutes slowly driving through the airport. The passengers thought it was a great time to stand up, open the overhead bins, start packing while the plane was in motion and something could easily fall down on someone's head, and the crew did nothing to stop it. So, once again, major safety hazard. Istanbul-Moscow was another story. It was Boeing 737-800 with the same seating chart, but the plane was newer, and the seats were better. Their design allowed for more legroom, and while it still wasn't spacious, it was tolerable. I still don't get why they decided to have a magazine pocket at the top of the seat (which is a great idea for maximising legroom) and at the knee level as well, because that doesn't make any sense from any perspective and shows poor management, but at least there were no metal bars this time. The seats felt super flimsy and cheap, though, with the whole row shaking and creaking whenever someone moved. I wonder if this plane will age well, because it seems like it will not. Cabin crew were much more pleasant this time around, and they actually made sure the people were seated with their seatbelts on. No wine or beer once again. The kosher meal was exactly the same, which was fine. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes with no explanation or apology.

176,C Morton,Czech Republic,2018-04-29,4,"New check-in procedure: change for worse. Flying form Prague to Moscow, Apr 21. Aeroflot apparently introduced a new dedicated counter for Business Class. So now they process separately Business class, Sky Priority and Economy passengers at the check in. Which might be a good idea at the main Aeroflot airports. However, in Prague it creates a lot of problems, confusions and discomfort. In the past, there was just common Business Class/Sky Priority counter and two for Economy. In this particular case, they checked in all 4 Business class passengers at one counter, 10 SkyPriority passengers at the other counter and all the remaining approx. 150 people at the single, remaining counter. In the past, they had two counters for economy, serving on average. 75 people each. Consequently, the new regime effectively doubled queues (and check in time) for economy passengers, but offered only a very little or no extra comfort for business passengers. Moreover, it disturbed the whole process, because people waiting in a very long queue were continuously trying to sneak in into SkyPriority.

The biggest issue however was at arrival when two of our suitcases came totally damaged, we have reported this at the airport immediately, were advised to log the given report via Aeroflot website within 7 days, now we received answer - very rude, lots of exclamation marks, asking for whole set of documents, new statement from us? for what - the report was done at the airport, copy of the passport, etc. Any airline can have a nice plane, but they can make a difference when something goes wrong and in customer service, apparently still long way to go with Aeroflot.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Male to Moscow,February 2018,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,2,no,True,Male,Moscow,,Negative,-0.9436,  male moscow really disappointed whole return male long ok crew rude big disappointment way treat passenger snappy answer etc delay almost two hour proper apology etc find strange drink serve half hour meal time meal arrive none leave wait another half hour get coffee think seriously way long haul flight big issue however arrival two suitcase come totally damage report airport immediately advised log give report via website within 7 day receive answer rude lot exclamation mark ask whole set document new statement us report do airport copy passport etc nice make difference something go wrong customer service apparently still long way go

187,David Manaker,Russian Federation,2018-02-22,7,"The reason I am writing this review is to commend the flight attendants for their conduct during the flight. I fly this route frequently on business, and have experienced more positives than negatives. First, the flight was near capacity, as always. The flight was smooth, seat was comfortable, food was bland but palatable. However, the flight was anything but uneventful. Just before beginning descent into Moscow Sheremyetevo, a woman walking down the aisle to the bathroom approaching me appeared faint and collapsed. I and a couple other passengers kept the woman from falling hard and lowered her to the floor. This was when the flight attendants jumped into action. The head attendant coordinated the staff, helping care for the woman. They asked for a doctor on the plane and fortunately there was one. The woman appeared to be having a diabetic episode, and the doctor attended to the distressed woman in the seat behind me, assisted by the flight attendants. All during the incident, the flight attendants were calm and professional. They did an excellent job of managing the situation, especially during landing and deboarding of the aircraft, managing the arrival of medical crews to assist the woman, while at the same time ensuring the safety of the passengers. I was very impressed with the ladies of Aeroflot!

190,Y Delniz,Netherlands,2018-02-21,1,"Amsterdam to Moscow. Overall, the inflight experience is OK, but nothing special. However the airline is terribly overpriced. The cheapest option you will find for Amsterdam to Moscow is at least €300. There are no other airlines flying this route without stop. It surprises me to see this airline, selling tickets from Amsterdam to Shanghai from just €350, but Amsterda to Moscow from €300. Note, that Amsterdam-Moscow is just a continental European, 3 hour flight with no onboard entertainment or anything special. KLM flies the same route charging the same prices. Now, I am flying monthly to Moscow, but not anymore from Amsterdam, but from Brussels, as it saves €100 per flight. I am strongly considering to fly with a layover in Riga from now on. Despite being an Aeroflot bonus member, and taking 23 flights last year, I have never been upgraded to anything, and never been recognised as a customer. On the contrary, when I had to change my plane tickets because of making a mistake with the dates (I contacted them within 1 hour after booking and went to the office within 2 hours after booking), they insisted that I had to pay, despite other airlines who change it for free within a reasonable timeframe.

The recline was adequate, but could have used higher feet elevation. Staff were attentive and friendly. I packed enough essential items on my carry ons in case the actual luggage got lost, since so many complaints of losing luggage, ours arrived on our destinations just fine. They are Very strict on weight of luggage, they will weigh the carry ons 10 kg max each and the regular luggage 23 kg max, I almost had a problem in Venice. My husband and I were allowed 2 check in each total of 4, we were checking in only 3 so we had ample extra but I packed the bags 24 kg, 25 kg, 15 kg. They insisted to move the luggage around even though we could have more. So make sure to pack under each suitcase. The food in flight was delicious, they had sea bass, halibut, beef brisket,etc. Even for 3 or 4 hr flight they served a full meal. However, they serve the drinks first, so don't finish the drinks or ask for 2,if you like drinking during your meals. The movie selection was adequate, the headphones are 2 prong, they only distribute once the plane is in flight so bring your own if you have one. There is a USB charger. People bring pets in the plane, small dogs,etc. The lady next to me wanted to put her dog by my foot, and I refused, they should be made to buy business class for more space, plus she put her dirty, bare foot on the food tray to elevate, which was gross, and she ate there! At the airport they sometimes bus you to the smaller planes, and it is cold! Bring warm clothing, thick jacket, scarf, hat.

213,S Lear,United Kingdom,2017-10-23,1,"✅ Verified Review   Heathrow to Hanoi return via Moscow. When we were queuing to board the plane we were called to one side and told the flight had been overbooked and as we had the longest connection time in Moscow we had to wait until the flight the following morning. We were put in a nearby hotel and went back to Heathrow in the morning and got on the next flight. On Aeroflot flights there's minimal drinks on offer, water, orange juice, or wine out of a paper cup. The food is okay, and the seat comfort average. When we landed in Hanoi we found out our bags had not come on the flight with us but the staff did not know where they were, nor could they tell us how long they would take to reach us. This is a huge problem when you're travelling around Vietnam for a month and in two days would be 1000 miles away from Hanoi where the bags would be delivered. We were given a number to call to check on the status of our bags but every time we phoned we were not given any information. A week later we were told our bags had been found. We arranged for them to be sent to hoi an where we picked them up. Absolutely no compensation from the airline, not even an apology. On our return flight our flight was delayed by 5 hours which meant we missed our connection. This would have been okay if Aeroflot arranged a hotel for us until the next flight the following morning. But instead we had to fight our way (literally) through queues at Moscow airport with hundreds of other delayed Aeroflot passengers to get our connecting flight booked, which was a 7am flight the next day. We were then told another rep would arrange our accommodation at midnight, the time now was 9pm. By midnight there was no sign of any rep. Other frustrated passengers started demanding information from the staff that were around but it was no use. At 3am we gave up and went to the gate to wait for 4 hours. The gates were full of hundreds of passengers, including babies and children, on airbeds they were handing out of a room at the end of the terminal. We queued for a further hour to get an airbed.

The airline did not load my luggage on to the connecting flight in Moscow not once, but twice - on both my outward and return journeys. I flew to Tokyo from Heathrow with a stopover in Moscow. Unfortunately, the first leg of the flight was delayed by an hour or so (with no reason given). As a result, I was rushed through the airport in Moscow and was frantically ushered on to my connection. When I arrived in Tokyo Narita I was informed that my case was still in Moscow. It was two days before I received it at the address I was staying at. I did consider the idea that this could happen again on my return journey three weeks later, but surely not? Oh yes it could. This time there were no delays, yet when I returned to London I was told that my bag was still in Moscow and could take a day or two to be delivered to me. I was given a number to call that looked suspiciously like a mobile number and told that they could not guarantee when I got my bag back. Early the next morning, I tried to call to find out where my bag was. The number given went straight to voicemail. I tried to call it several times, but still nothing. I then tried to call the baggage customer helplines. All three numbers were busy and I didn't succeed in getting through to anyone over a five hour period. Calling the baggage handler responsible for Aeroflot at Heathrow was also useless, and they passed me another mobile number that also didn't answer. I then tried calling the Aeroflot desk at Heathrow, and was grateful to speak to a human being.

Unfortunately, each Aeroflot flight undermines my pride. I have been dissapointed, when my flight Moscow to Yerevan was cancelled without any prior announcement. I was waiting in Sheremetyevo to check-in my luggage (only two counters were opened for international flight passengers) just to find out that my flight is cancelled. However, one can see ""on time"" mark on the timetable. My husband was at that time flying to Moscow from Berlin to catch the same flight. Dut to the weather conditions, I expected the cancellation to happen, but what happened next, demonstrates the complete lack of Aeroflot`s ability to organize the passenger flow in such situations. My husband eventually got stuck in the transit zone with the flight information ""on time"", no Aeroflot personnel and people, who were sleeping on the mattresses! He found an Aeroflot representative only after an hour of running through different terminals of Sheremetyevo airport. At the same time I was literally fighting to get the same-day-flight to Yerevan (2 ladies at the counter for over 200 passengers), while the Aeroflot representative was extremely impolite and borderline offensive. Eventually, I got a flight 3 hours later (which got delayed for 3 more hours), and my husband managed to get a flight 3 hours (plus 1 hour delay) after my delayed flight. Waiting time at Sheremetyevo was more than 10 hours. We could not even fly together. They still had seats but they pointed out that it ""is too difficult for them"". No food or hotel were provided, not even a bottle of water. Anyway, the whole time all I wanted to hear was: ""We are sorry for your inconvenience. Your possible options would be"".

Flight cancellations are not rare occurrences, of course. However, the way Aeroflot handled the cancellation left a lot to be desired.

I then phoned the agent but to no avail and given that there was no after-hour support in my region, I called their reservations hotline in Russia, only to find that some of their staff did not even speak comprehensible English. To complicate things, they denied the reservations code they themselves supplied, claiming that there was no numbers but only letters, when it clearly contained 2 numbers! After a rather unproductive 5-minute conversation where the staff kept prompting me to repeat and verify the reference code, they asked me for the ticket number. Guess what? They then forwarded me to another service agent, kind of implying it was a special case and they couldn't handle it. When I was finally connected, I was asked to supply the reference code again and they once again said their reference codes do not contain numbers. Of course, that member of staff also ended up asking me to quote the ticket number and sounded hugely impatient when I said ""hold on let me retrieve it"" with a long and deep breath. Mind you, it took me less than 15 seconds to retrieve it. When I finally started quoting the number, that staff member did not respond until I repeated a few times the first 6 digits and the deafening silence caused me to think the call was interrupted. Yet, after a few ""hellos"" he finally went ""CONTINUE!"" and that was one of the most impolite commands I'd ever encountered in phone conversations with airline personnel! To make things worse, he then said he needed to check my booking details further and put me on hold without even saying anything like ""please hold the line"".

232,F Torres,Philippines,2017-06-21,9,"✅ Verified Review   The flight from Hong Kong to Moscow was delayed though not the fault of the airline as the cause was due to traffic at the runway. Plane from Hong Kong to Moscow was a B777-300ER which has good IFE, seat pitch in the economy class is similar to most airlines of the same aircraft. It was relatively clean and flight attendants are ready to assist passengers. Plane from Moscow to Tel Aviv was A330 2x4x2 seat configuration in the economy class. I would say that it has more legroom than the B777. Take off and landing were both smooth. My observation on all Aeroflot flights, drinks are served first then the meal followed after half an hour and another round of drinks after another half an hour. It was a bit inconvenient eating without something to drink. The food trays are collected by the flight attendants after 30 minutes or so that passngers voluntered to bring them to the galley. .Definitely no alcholo on-board.

234,Maija Tolmes,United States,2017-06-11,9,"✅ Verified Review   Aeroflot uses new B777s on the JFK-SVO route, and business class cabin is very clean, featuring with new flat bed seats. The seats are comfortable enough, with a good leg room and a good width even with the 2x2x2 seat plan, six seats in a row. In compare with, for example, Finnair business class with fewer seats in a row, the Aeroflot B777 seats offer little less privacy, because they are closer to the aisle, but the width of the seat itself is good. Considering the lower price of the Aeroflot business class ticket, it's a very good deal. Nice detail: a pillowcase sealed in a plastic bag was included in the blanket/pillow set. The lunch menu with six courses: appetizer, entrée, salad, soup, choice of three main courses and dessert, I liked it very much.

I have done this trip before, and not much had changed from previous times. The flight was full as always. No alcoholic beverages are served on the domestic flights inside Russia. The main language is Russian (understandably) but flight attendents and announcements are done in English as well. There is no ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling from the flight attendents, but they are professional. Boarding the plane is all-at-once, chaotic. Best to be near the front of the boarding line, since Russians have a habit of trying to carry-on everything and the overhead bins fill quickly. Be prepared to board/unboard at Sheremetevo via a stairway on the tarmac after a short bus ride from the terminal. The meal served on both flights was a beef sandwich with cheese, horseradish sauce, and a pickle on dark bread, with a small fruit bar and a mandarin orange. Not great, but for a short flight it was better than most budget airlines. There was a delay out of Sheremetevo for mechanical repairs - While boarding we could see a mechanic tightening lug nuts on the A231's tire.

239,Richard Kirby,Russian Federation,2017-05-11,1,"✅ Verified Review   Moscow to Yuzhno Sakhalinsk. On check in at Moscow the staff were rude and refused to check me in as one of my bags as it weighed 24kg instead of 23kg, even though my 2nd check in luggage weighed 12kg. They told me to take 1kg out or pay 2000rur or they wouldnt let me fly. Out of the 46kg I was entitled to take I only had 36kg and ended up having to take 1kg out of my luggage and hand carry it onboard. There was only 1 person scanning boarding passes for economy passengers with no help and no proper queue so all customers were just pushing to get to the desk to board. This was highly unorganised and not pleasant. We had to board on a bus even though we were flying on a full B777 while smaller A320's and B737's sat at the gate making the boarding process very uncomfortable . The plane was one of Aeroflot's oldest B777's. The USB charger was broken at my seat and one of the toilets was out of order. They hadn't changed the entertainment from April to May even though they provided the May entertainment guide. The food was terrible and they ran out of the food selection I wanted due to the way they were serving food (back to front rows). For breakfast I got a buckwheat porridge however it wasnt a porridge at all, just a tray full of cooked but dry buckwheat. They don't serve any alcohol on an 8hr flight - if you want some you have to pay for it and if you want a snack you also have to pay for it.

Not much pleasures onboard apart from an OK working IFE system on the long sector only. Very strict at check-in in CPH and had to rearrange luggage twice as to meet practiced requirements as they deny more than 10 kg hand-luggage. I had no privileges in their FFProgramme, so could not claim much rights, apart from being entitled to 23 kg according to the tickets which was very cheap (450 USD return, purchased online almost a year earlier. 6 months ticket). Service onboard mediocre on the short haul, but for the price paid, you’ll survive. Transfer in Moscow very quick and smooth, less than 5 Minutes for security and immigration check. On the long haul to SGN (12 hours+) hot meals (2-3 options!) and drinks/wines were served for the first half of the flight until they “ran out” (not true, its merely cost saving or fear of drunks). Hot meals were very good: supper service offered 2 options and breakfast 3 hot options. Wines were surprisingly good, to my taste they were excellent and well chosen. IFE the best I have encountered and easy to operate. Good value for money, but please travel light. Got 75% miles to their FFP, which will be enough to a long-haul upgrade after 3-5 more legs.

257,David Manaker,Russian Federation,2017-01-30,7,"✅ Verified Review   I had a domestic round trip to Tyumen from Moscow on business. Flying domestically in Russia is relatively inexpensive: my ticket was 7000 rubles, roughly 116 USD at the current exchange rate. A similar flight in the US would be 2 to 3 times as expensive and with about the same experience. As always, boarding the plane with Aeroflot is chaotic. Announcements are few, if any. There is no particular order for boarding by zones, so people queue up early. Both flights were at or very near capacity. The flight to Tyumen was uncomfortable, the cabin temperature so warm that I was sweating on the plane. The return flight to Moscow was a little better, but the cabin temperature was still warm. Seats were cramped with very little leg room on this B737-800. Both flights had in-flight meal consisting of a sandwich, small fruit bar, and a mandarin orange, but considering it was only a 2.5 hour flight getting anything in economy/coach is a bonus. The flight attendants were professional but not particularly cordial. Arriving in Moscow Sheremetovo we had to wait in a holding pattern due to a heavy snowstorm, but still landed on time. We had to descend from a mobile platform and board a bus to take us from the tarmack to the terminal, and with the snow it was a bit slippery.

259,Paul Hillsmith ,United Kingdom,2017-01-26,1,"✅ Verified Review   Flew London Heathrow to Beijing via Moscow. My only reason to write this review is to warn other Skyteam members not to fly with Aeroflot. From booking to flight, aside from the planes being relatively new and a lower price than the poor standard Chinese airlines there is no other reason to fly with them. Despite being a Platinum member I was unable to book any economy comfort seats nor even an exit seat, they are all blocked for Aeroflot members only - and on the London to Moscow leg all the exit seats were empty and we were not allowed to move to them. On the 9.5 hour Beijing leg there are no extra legroom seats as they are only available on the 777's, so you are on an aircraft that most airlines use on medium haul with only 30 inches legroom - the cabin was crammed with people all over the place and as normal rather large people at that with legs in the aisles. Check-in was supposed to start at 7.40 but we waited until 8am whilst listening to the staff stories about the night before whilst they drank their coffee, the start of abysmal service displayed throughout the entire journey. Flight left 1 hour late and then at Moscow was delayed again by 1.15 whilst they de-iced the wings. The food was not only poor it was inedible, and I had the same AVML meal on both legs plus no alcohol at all, and when questioned all I got was a curt ""we never have any"" reply. Why on earth not? There is no religious reason on flights to China and even China Eastern has 2 bottles of red and white. Lounges were typical Eastern European, absolutely packed and with no hot food whatsoever, I managed to find some coleslaw and sweet bread plus some Chilean wine to keep me going as I'd eaten nothing for over 6 hours. Entertainment system was zero on the flight from London, not even a communal TV nor any music, and on the Beijing flight it kept breaking down. At no time did any staff walk around with drinks, there are no snacks available not even noodles and if you press your call button they do not answer. I can only assume that the reason to travel with them is the price, it was a terrible experience from start to finish.

Boarding delayed by an hour, with no explanations or apologies. Flight To Yakutz full, cabin temp very high and uncomfortable. Many passengers around me were hot, but I was the only one to approach a crew member about it. They all promised to do something about it, but didn't. After 4 hours of stifling heat, I started to feel ill, and approached another cabin crew, who seemed really interested in our misery, and suddenly the temp dropped to a comfortable level.

First flight from Ho Chi Minh City was almost full up to Xmas time with long queues at Check-in. I got the seat I wanted, later swapped as an FA had a proposal to a better option in the crowded economy class. Business and Comfort class had less than 30% load while economy >90%. Full service onboard. Alcohol limited to two wines which were only served at meal time – and they ran out after 5 hours. Two meal services were offered on this 11 hour flight. In both cases were there two options for hot meals. Food was surprisingly good, managed to try all four hot dishes offered as passengers next to me offered me some of theirs as there were plenty. The scoop of the trip was somehow a surprise round of tasty, Russian ice-creams served quickly to all in the middle of the flight where blood sugar was low. Nice thought! Menu cards (in Vietnamese, Russian and English), earplugs, slippers and eye-masks provided. Spacious seats with ample leg room, slept well. Power Outlets. WiFi proclaimed but did not test. Call buttons answered. FAs could be worse, could be better (at times quite hostile, at times very cooperative). Aircraft clean, staff were well dressed, and hard-working. I see the rising quality-trend of Aeroflot. IFE had huge amount of movies and stuff on personal monitors. Quite some of them could not work.

272,Christian Prade,Switzerland,2016-12-08,10,"✅ Verified Review   Bangkok to Zurich via Moscow. Because of the price, I chose Aeroflot and I was surprised by the quality of the service, the food and the ground staff at both airports. The planes were new and the landings despite the snow in Moscow perfect. Wiffi was available and the entertainment system was bilingual (Russian and English) and very diverse. I love the documentary on Soviet cars. The crew was smiling and I had a special very good Thai menu. I had a special luggage, a gun, as I compete internationally. The first good news is that Aeroflot includes it in the whole weight allowance contrary to many companies that charges extra fees up to 200 US dollars. I was advised at the plane door that my gun was on the plane to Moskow.

276,John Mathias,United Kingdom,2016-11-30,7,"✅ Verified Review   
Aeroflot service can be very good, but, nonetheless seems to be inconsistent. My outbound flight on SU2579 on November 25th from London-LHR to Moscow-SVO reflected very high service standards, as the staff on board were attentive and charming. The return trip on November 29th from SVO to LHR was, however, mediocre, even allowing for my class of travel (economy). The cabin crew seemed to have an indifferent attitude, in stark contrast to the outbound flight. One flight attendant tried to tell me in a peremptory way to sit down again once we had arrived, even though the plane had come to a complete stop at the gate and the engines had been switched off a few minutes before. The flight took off from SVO with a delay of over an hour, which was explained as the result of a technical problem. However, no detailed explanation, which would have been useful, was given, and the cabin staff did not know the reason, which they should have done, I suspect it was an APU issue, as the cabin was freezing until the engines were started. Nevertheless, the captain managed to reduce the delay to 45 minutes by arrival. One significant advantage of flying Aeroflot is the Moscow airport it uses, Sheremetyevo. Domodedovo (DME), on the other hand, is now unpleasantly overcrowded, with long immigration queues.",A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SVO to LHR,November 2016,3.0,4.0,3.0,,5.0,,5,yes,False,SVO,LHR,,Positive,0.6249,  verified review service good nonetheless seem inconsistent outbound su2579 november 25th reflect high service standard staff board attentive charm return trip november 29th svo lhr however mediocre allow class travel economy cabin crew seem indifferent attitude stark contrast outbound one attendant try tell peremptory way sit arrive though come complete stop gate engine switch minute take svo delay hour explain result technical problem however detailed explanation useful give cabin staff know reason do suspect apu issue cabin freeze engine start nevertheless captain manage reduce delay 45 minute arrival one significant advantage fly moscow airport use sheremetyevo domodedovo dme hand unpleasantly overcrowd long immigration queue

298,J Nabouira,France,2016-05-06,2,"✅ Verified Review   I flew with Aeroflot from Nice to Tokyo return via Moscow and it was horrible. I didn't expect it to be the best because it was not expensive but there is a minimum. The seats were uncomfortable and service wasn't good, they serve the drinks and a long time later the meal, and were slow to clear trays after you finish eating.  Cherry on the cake they lost my luggage on the way back. Meanwhile they didn't explain anything and were not nice at all. After 10 days I received my suitcase damaged and without the handle. Not to mention how it was inside. They didn't take responsibility for anything and didn't even apologize.

299,G Rorbaley,Russian Federation,2016-04-21,7,"✅ Verified Review   Moscow to Hong Kong on Aeroflot Boeing 777, and I am glad of the new aircraft. Good food and excellent staff. Quite comfortable seats, everything seems to be fine, but the backrest recline seems no more than economy. So the level of comfort for long-distance flight is not the very best. It is strange that for such an aircraft at SVO Airport we had to use the old terminal.
