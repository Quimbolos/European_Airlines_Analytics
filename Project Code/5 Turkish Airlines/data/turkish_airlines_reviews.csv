0,Somayeh Shojaei,Canada,2023-11-15,1,"I am deeply disappointed with Turkish Airlines customer service. Despite multiple attempts to contact them regarding urgent travel issues, there has been no response. This experience has shattered my trust in the airline's commitment to customer care. A prompt and efficient response is crucial in the travel industry, and Turkish Airlines has failed to meet this basic expectation. This lack of communication has added unnecessary stress to my travel plans. This was the worst customer service that I have had. I strongly advise potential passengers to consider this before choosing Turkish Airlines for their journey.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Tehran via Istanbul,November 2023,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,1,no,False,Vancouver,Tehran,Istanbul

Multiple change of airline time and date, super last min, with busy daily life you have to deal with these changes multiple times frustrate us so so much. Made a mistake of booking an extra seat and called immediately multiple times only to just hear “sorry but nothing we can do”. I even suggested to pay extra cost on cancelation / Reschedule flight ticket willing to pay / pls help on this honest mistake, no care or kindness to provide any solution.

3,T. Eldem,Canada,2023-11-11,4,"Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. As I connected from a domestic flight I went straight to the TK lounge which offered a wide array of food and beverages with ample seating and relaxation options. Boarding started one hour prior to take-off and, as with all TK flights, was chaotic and lacked proper handling by the gate agents. I was shocked to see that they did not bother to match my passport to my boarding pass. Onboard, the hard product was new and a welcome improvement in terms of privacy and aisle access. However, the seats are quite challenging to get in and out of and would pose a problem for passengers with a larger build. Following take-off we were given a drink menu and told that there would be no food menu and that we would be given an option to choose a main course only. When lunch was served, they simply brought a pre-plated tray with appetizer and dessert and no salad option. Unlike previous experiences on TK, there was no appetizer or dessert trolley and no soup offering. The catering was a significant downgrade from the standard TK had previously established and won accolades for. The food quality and taste was at best OK but drink options were good with champagne on offer. The seat was comfortable and offered lots of storage options but inability to set the foot and back rest to individual settings took some getting used to. IFE had plenty to choose from with the latest movies and music in their library. FA’s were quite attentive and went about their business with calm and poise instead of the frantic running around I had observed on several other flights. The flight took off slightly behind schedule but landed on time. The overall experience was OK but the downgrade in catering was a total disappointment. I would look at other carriers on this route as TK seems to have abandoned its distinguishing practice of top notch catering.",A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to Montreal,November 2023,3.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1,yes,True,Istanbul,Montreal,

The only decent flight was the first one from Miami to Istanbul and from there every single flight was a nightmare, from the flights being delayed to the rude people working on these flights. From Istanbul to Miami  had a flight attendant that was super rude to the point that I asked him for a water and he wouldn’t even look at me and just walk away,  that I had to go back to the place where they have the food and water and I had to ask him in bad way (are you ever going to give me the water I asked you for?). I would never fly again with them.

I inquired about catching the earlier flight as mine was already showing a one-hour delay. He put me on standby which eventually came through. On board the business class configuration was the same as European carriers with the seats the same as economy with the middle seat left empty. The seat width and pitch were narrow bordering on uncomfortable. After an on-time departure, we were served a hot breakfast which is a welcome surprise for a 45 minute flight. I opted for coffee instead only to be told they had adjusted their catering and would not serve coffee on domestic flights. Instead, I was offered tea. Whilst it did not matter for such a short flight, I found it absurd that they would not serve coffee but tea. I even pointed out the menu we were given which clearly showed coffee on offer.

7,T Eldem,Canada,2023-11-05,6,"Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. 72 hours before the flight I received notice of an aircraft change which resulted in my advanced seat selection becoming useless as I ended up in a window seat with a neighbour instead of a direct aisle access seat. I tried resolving the matter by talking to their call centre which proved to be futile and a giant waste of time. Check-in was smooth and handled by a very pleasant agent. I used the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge prior to boarding which was well equipped with several food and beverage choices with some made to order. On board, the hard product looked worn and tired. The seat cushions were worn out and made it uncomfortable especially in the lie-flat position. The configuration on the A330 offers almost no privacy and has limited space for stuff you would want to keep within reach. We were served drinks and a hot meal shortly after take off. Food and beverage quality was good but I noticed a downgrade in the usual TK inflight offering I had come to expect. There was no appetizer or dessert trolley resulting in a single choice. Bathrooms were kept clean but as with every TK flight, the cabin temperature was uncomfortably warm. The FA’s were very friendly and accommodating and worked very hard throughout the flight. Two hours before landing a full hot breakfast was served but I opted for coffee only. The IFE had a wide selection with recent movies and music. Flight left late but landed slightly behind schedule.

I used to be a loyal customer, but my recent flights have been nothing short of a nightmare. The flight from Prishtina to Istanbul was delayed for hours, from 8:25 pm to 11:50 pm, with no communication or updates provided. To make matters worse, the flight from Istanbul to Doha was abruptly canceled, leaving passengers in complete darkness with zero information. Upon reaching the airport, I was greeted by an outrageously long queue. While Turkish Airlines did arrange a hotel for us, it was located two hours away from the airport. By the time we were able to check in, it was already 6 in the morning. My rescheduled flight for today at 8:45 pm has been subject to continuous delays, and I am currently stranded at the airport with no information or assistance. Even my attempts to seek help at the Turkish Airlines care point were futile due to the never-ending queue. This entire experience has been a nightmare, and I have never felt so let down by an airline. I can confidently say that I will never choose to fly with Turkish Airlines again.

12,C Larsen,United States,2023-10-28,1,"When I arrived in Istanbul from the US my connecting flight to Bucharest had been cancelled. I was given no information in the email/text message about what to do so had to wander around the Istanbul airport international arrivals hall looking for a service desk. When I found it, it was chaos, frustrated customers yelling, TA employees yelling back, no clear lines, no communication, nothing. They had cancelled so many flights to different destinations and left people stranded. Spent over three hours at customer service only to be finally told that they couldn't get me to Bucharest (an hour flight) until the following night (I had arrived in Istanbul at around 9am). Total mess that screwed up an entire itinerary since Bucharest was not my final destination in Romania. Their hospitality consisted of putting out a box of cheese sandwiches and some water. I didn't even get that because by the time I was out of the customer service line all the food and water were gone and God forbid they put out more than one box. Finally I cancelled the connecting flight to Bucharest and booked a bus there from Istanbul. When I told the customer service person to forget the flight to Bucharest, I was taking a bus, he told me that I would not be able to use my return tickets to the US if I cancelled the flight to Bucharest. I argued with him, he asked what passport I was flying on, I said I was American and gave him my US passport and he magically changed his mind and told me I could still have my return flights. Then it took over two hours to find my luggage, this was after I stood in line for about an hour to talk to someone at baggage claim. Other people at baggage claim who had also been stranded were just walking out of the airport without their bags completely exhausted and ticked off. Some of them had been there for hours. It was not just me, passengers were talking to one another and we were all having a miserable experience. The best part? After all of this I found out that Tarom Airlines had seats available from Istanbul to Bucharest that night and it was the same flight as a TA flight. Why they could not put me on that flight I will never understand. My return flight to the US from Istanbul (I flew back to Istanbul from Bucharest on a Friday evening and flew back to the US Sunday afternoon so I could have a one day stopover) was delayed by four hours which meant I got to the US at around 11pm instead of 7pm. Wound up taking a $100 taxi ride home because public transit from the airport stops at midnight on Sunday where I live. Once again, hospitality involved a cheese sandwich and a bottle of water which they gave out when the plane was boarding. No food voucher for the Istanbul airport where I had to wait for seven hours since I arrived three hours early to check in (the email/text message about the flight delay was sent when I was already in the taxi on my way to the airport). Apparently I was supposed to wait to eat until I was in line to board. Now I am going in circles trying to get a refund for the flight. I can't even find out how much the flight cost since I bought all four of my flights at the same time and there is just a lump sum on the receipt. Called customer service and was told to fill out an online feedback form which requires a ticket number to submit.

17,H Wilson,United Kingdom,2023-10-19,1,We were flying from Heathrow to Singapore via Istanbul (what a mistake). Our flight from Heathrow was delayed for three hours so we missed our connection to Singapore. After alighting the aircraft we received no help at all. We were sent from desk to desk in a very very large airport. All Turkish Airline staff were extremely rude and just snarled at us. It was only with the help of a younger passenger that we found a Care Desk (not correctly named). We lined up for an hour and two new boarding passes were thrown at us for a flight at 5pm the next day. We were told to go to the Hotel Desk. No signage at all. We found the desk and queued for another hour to be seen. We are both in our late seventies so this was really troubling to us. We then had to wait for another hour for all passengers to be seen and queued for a coach. The coach then took us for a two hour journey to a hotel. When we arrived we had to queue for another hour to be booked in. By this time it was 6.30am. We only had time for a quick breakfast and a short nap to then be transported back to Istanbul Airport in what was a converted Transit Van. The flight to Singapore was further delayed for another hour. All in all it took us 40 hours to reach Singapore a journey that was supposed to take 15 hours. We have subsequently cancelled our return flight with this terrible airline and have booked at considerable expense on a Singapore Airlines flight. As mentioned before we are both in our seventies and could not risk a repeat of the outward journey. Do not be fooled by the competitive prices this airline charges.

I hadn't received a ticket. I wrote to Turkish Airlines feedback on their web site and waited for more than 3 weeks to get a reply. Well, I received it today and I realize that I have a flight today ( I would like to remind that they told me I could travel the date of my choice). I called customer service again to change the day of my departure and the woman who answered the phone seemed to be careless and told me that I should go to Pearson airport( which takes time and money to get there) and ask them to change the date as there is less than 24 hour till my flight to Istanbul.

32,Marieke Aarts,Netherlands,2023-09-29,1,"Turkish Airlines has disappointed us twice. Especially the customer service was very disappointing and made us very upset. We travelled from Düsseldorf via Istanbul to Riyadh and back in Sept 2023. Both ways we had delays. The way there we could not make it to the connecting flight, so we were offered a later flight and a voucher for some food at IST airport. The food court was disappointing, as all the ‘restaurants’ that are on the voucher offer had non vegetarian food. The way back we had a delay as well. We arrived at gate A1. In the airplane they could not give us any information about the connecting flight (whether it would wait for us or not, or about from which gate the connecting flight was leaving). We ran for 25 minutes (and really a sprint) and we made it. Our luggage did not. When we arrived at Düsseldorf airport we made a report with the employee from the lost and found department. She told us the luggage would be sent to our home address. It never happened. 3 days after that we received an email that our luggage arrived in Dusseldorf. But since then we never heard from them again. So frustrating. Customer service of Turkish Airlines said it was not their responsibility anymore, it was the handling office at the airport. The only thing the Airline did was sending emails to this office (we did that as well), but without any result. They never got back to us and did nothing to help us. We sent dozens of emails and called everyday, but without success. In the end we travelled 2 hours back and forth to get our luggage. Besides that, it was not possible to make an official complaint. The customer service on the phone told me to fill in a feedback form, but the reaction on this form said they could not handle this feedback. I cannot believe how bad the service of Turkish Airlines is.

However there was no clear explanations or communications and were left waiting at a check in desk, with a 7 year old sitting on floors whilst the check in staff and supervisors desperately tried to resolve the situation. I must say the staff all tried their best, however there was a lack of communication, nobody really knew what was happening and nobody could explain anything to us. Eventually with around 40 minutes until our flight took off we were handed boarding passes with the seat numbers left blank, told to board our flight to Istanbul and once we arrived at Istanbul we would have 3 options which were: There would be seats available and allocated to us or There would not be seats available in which case we would be put on the next available flight and compensated Or there would not be seats available, if the next available flight was not until the next day we would be compensated and accommodated in a hotel overnight. We were then told that our flight from Izmir was delayed. When we landed at Istanbul we had to run to the International transfers and by the time we arrived there I saw I had received a text message that my flight had changed to a flight the next day which would have been sent before we had even landed. At the desk we were informed that seats were found for us on the original flight, however we had missed the flight due to the delayed flight from Izmir. I know that the flight to Heathrow was delayed and was still on the ground and boarding at the time - and we were told in Izmir that the only seat available on the flight was 1 seat in business class. We were automatically changed onto a flight at 14:50 on 27th August. The seats we were given were 6B, 6C and 13A which meant my daughter couldn’t have a window seat and my husband had to spend the flight separated from us. We were then directed to the Turkish Airlines Hotel desk to arrange for overnight accommodation. When we finally reached the desk we then had to wait a further hour or so before we were transported to our accommodation. During which time my daughter was now hungry and tired. I had no choice but to buy food for her.  We were then transported to the Ibis Istanbul airport, and on arrival all I can describe the scene as is carnage. There was no method, no order, nothing, just names randomly called out. The time now was past 10pm. By the time we were allocated a room and were able to get food it was gone 11pm. The next day we were given breakfast at the hotel, however had to buy lunch. To date Turkish airlines have refused to accept responsibility, and even acknowledge the overbooking of the flight and the forced 'bumping' of our seats. They are refusing to pay us compensation for the delay or the bumping of our seats and continuously give different excuses to validate the delay to avoid paying compensation.

At check in the staff suggested that my child had some kind of illness (he had just mosquito bites on the face). She sent us to the doctor's office without explaining anything. We tried to explain to her that these were mosquito bites, but it didn't help. We went to the doctor. He said it was probably insect bites or dermatitis after briefly examining the child. He said that there was no reason for them to prohibit us from flying. But the airline needs a report, and they can do it. It just costs $100. Personally, we didn’t need this report. An airline representative needed it! At the same time, we had to pay, but no one warned us about this. And the report that was carried out had no force in any case. We returned to the check desk, explaining the situation that it was definitely not an infection, as the girl suggested. And that we are not ready to pay $100 just for a doctor’s signature in this ridiculous situation. But no one even wanted to talk to us. Everyone, including the “not the most loyal” female supervisor, just repeated the phrase “these are company rules, you won’t fly away without a report. 3 minutes left before registration.” The comical situation was that we did not have enough cash! and Russian cards are not accepted. In the end, we were left with no choice - we ran around the airport looking for cash. And thanks God we found money! We had to pay $100 for the sign in a report saying that the child had common dermatitis! The employee preparing the documents promised to send me an online check by mail for presentation to the insurance company within 2 minutes. We couldn't wait to check this because we might have missed boarding. I checked that he recorded my email correctly. And know what? I didn't receive it. Then I wrote letters to everyone for several days to finally receive my check. You know, this is not a question of money at all. I can certainly handle losing $100 for nothing. But here is the fact that the airline employees were not friendly at all, not even trying to help. I wrote a complaint to the airline. The answer was ""amazing"".

Before embarking on my long-haul flight, I attempted to contact their customer service at to inquire about making changes. Regrettably, reaching them was quite challenging, and I endured a frustrating half-hour hold time without receiving any assistance. When it was time for my family and me to board our flight from Barcelona to Singapore, Turkish Airlines inexplicably separated us. Despite having booked our seats together as three passengers, we found ourselves scattered apart. Naturally, we voiced our discontent, as it's unreasonable to split a family on such a lengthy journey, especially after reserving specific seats. Adding to the frustration, the airline sent me numerous confusing emails with 5 days before my flight, suggesting that my seats reservation had been refunded. These emails were unclear and seemed to be plagued by technical issues, causing further anxiety and uncertainty. Furthermore, I must highlight that the customer service assistants, both in Barcelona and Istanbul, were notably rude and appeared to lack proper training. Their unhelpful demeanor and lack of responsiveness further compounded our dissatisfaction with the airline's service. It was evident that they were ill-prepared to provide the level of service one would expect from a reputable airline, leaving us with a disappointing overall experience. Upon boarding the flight, the only solution I found was to negotiate with another passenger who had been assigned the seat my wife should have been assigned. Thankfully, this person agreed to switch seats, but this situation was far from ideal. Considering that Turkish Airlines is part of the Star Alliance group, this level of service is unacceptable.

I explained that  we would not get on the flight unless we were reassured that we would not have problems with our connection from Istanbul to London.  We were told by Turkish airlines ground staff not to worry. If we missed our connection there were seats on the next flight  just 2 hours later and we and our luggage would be reassigned. On the basis of this reassurance we got on the flight. We arrived from Singapore in Istanbul at 6.15pm, late. There was no explanation or apology at any point. We missed our connecting flight as a result. Ground staff have no ability to find a new flight it seems.  The flight that we were meant to be reassigned to does not have any seats and never seemingly did. We ourselves find flights from another airport using Google.  It takes over 2 hours and much frustration to sort out new flights. We are asked to sign waiver forms in order to be provided with our new tickets. We refuse and have to demand that the tickets be printed and handed over. Our new flight is the next day from the other side of Istanbul.  Now for luggage, which we need to collect.  Scenes of chaos greet us when getting luggage.  We arrive to find very many people waiting. About 30 at least.  We had been told that our luggage would be waiting for us (they claim to have called). It takes over another hour to get our luggage which has in part been lost for a period.  Again we are asked to sign forms.  We refuse.    Then we need to get a hotel sorted. Again we are told that this would be easy. It’s not. There is a queue of about 40 people. Another wait and very slow.   We then spent an hour in a shuttle bus to our hotel.   We arrived at the hotel at midnight.  This has taken 6 hours since landing. Having been told that the hotel would be in Central Istanbul. It is clearly not but instead it’s near the other airport. There’s a stray dog in the hotel lobby. Our flight the next day to London is also delayed by almost 2 hours.  We arrive eventually in London after 6.00 pm London time. Total trip time from Singapore to London 41 hours.  ",,Family Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to London via Istanbul,September 2023,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,True,Singapore,London,Istanbul

66,M Balem,United Arab Emirates,2023-09-06,1,"As someone who has been a loyal Turkish Airlines customer for a considerable time i recently accumulated around 50,000 Miles and Smiles points. i was excited to use these points to book a flight and maybe even upgrade my seats. However, my experience with the Miles and Smiles program has been incredibly frustrating. According to the Turkish Airlines app and website, members should be able to use their points to purchase tickets or reduce the cost. I attempted to do this multiple times online, but each time we reached the final step, an error message appeared, directing me to contact customer service. I followed the instructions and visited a Turkish Airlines sales office in Dubai, where i was told that i needed 65,000 points to use them for ticket purchases. This contradicted the information available online. Additionally, when i asked to at least use my points to book seats, I was told it wasn't possible at the office. I called the provided number for assistance, but after waiting for over 30 minutes, i received no help and were advised to contact the website help department. This inconsistency in information and lack of support has left me disappointed and questioning the transparency of the Miles and Smiles program. I feel frustrated and let down by Turkish Airlines' customer service. I hope Turkish Airlines can address these issues promptly and ensure that the program's terms and conditions are clear and consistent both online and in their offices. I love flying with Turkish Airlines and want to continue doing so, but these recent experiences have left me with doubts.

70,Ronald Risse,Netherlands,2023-09-02,3,"In Bali we were delayed by 4 hours. We were supposed to fly at 9:05 PM but left at 12:50 AM. As a result, we missed our transfer to Turkey, so we got a new flight. Instead of at 7.30 am we now fly at 7.20 pm. So we have to spend 11.5 hours at the AirPort in Istanbul. At 8.15 we landed at Istanbul AirPort. We went to an information point. We were then sent to the Turkish Airline counter where there was a very long line. We were then taken to another counter. When we arrived at the counter, we were taken out of the queue as a group “Amsterdam”. So we got hope that we could freshen up a bit. Wait again. We were told that we could go to a hotel at the AirPort itself. The lady who guided us was very rude because according to her it was not her problem but ours and according to her it was not part of her job. When we arrived at the hotel, the man said it was private so they couldn't help us. The lady had already disappeared, what should we do now? Back to the counter. There they said they couldn't help us. We could go to a hotel in Istanbul ourselves, but we were not told where to go and how. Because we didn't know how to get to a hotel, we decided to stay at the AirPort itself out of necessity. Which gave us a lot of stress. We met two guys who had the same flight as us. From Bali to Turkey and from Turkey to the Netherlands. 1 of those boys called his mother to call Corendon. Corendon would call Turkish airlines and if all goes well he would be called back. That never happened. We stood in line at the counter again and with a lot of sighs we received 1 voucher per person to get food. We could only get fast food there and not a good meal. (Already walked 4 km and more than 5700 steps further, very large AirPort where we were sent from pillar to post.) Not to mention how unfriendly they are. His knee bothers me a lot and when we had to follow someone they yelled at us that it's actually not her job to take us. And we had already asked her three times if she wanted to walk a little more slowly. We were ignored and no one wanted to help us. 11.30 at the food counter where we sat until 6pm without anyone looking after us. Then we went after the gate and finally we left at 7:20 PM. All in all we were on the road for about 36 hours with one small meal and a lot of discomfort. We experienced this as a major blemish on our holiday and hope that Corendon will take up this matter and can do something for us. Op Bali zijn we 4 uur vertraagd. We zouden 21.05 vliegen maar gingen 00.50 weg. Hierdoor mistte we onze overstap op Turkije waardoor we een nieuwe vlucht kregen. In plaats van om 7.30 vliegen we nu om 19.20. Dus moeten 11,5 uur vertoeven op de AirPort in Instanbul. Om 8.15 zijn we geland op Instanbul AirPort We zijn naar een informatiepunt gegaan. Vervolgens werden we naar de Turkish Airline balie gestuurd waar een hele lange rij stond. We werden daarna meegenomen naar een andere balie. Bij de balie aangekomen werden we als groep “Amsterdam” uit de rij gehaald. We kregen dus hoop dat we ons een beetje konden opfrissen.Weer wachten. Er werd ons verteld dat we naar een hotel konden op de AirPort zelf. De dame die ons daarin begeleide was zeer onbeleefd want het was volgens haar niet haar probleem maar de onze en het hoorde volgens haar niet bij haar werk. Bij dat hotel aangekomen zei die man dat het privé was dus ze ons niet konden helpen. De dame was inmiddels alweer verdwenen, wat moesten we nu. Weer terug naar de balie. Daar zeiden ze dat ze ons niet konden helpen. We konden zelf naar een hotel in Istanbul, maar waar we dan naar toe moesten en hoe werd ons ook niet verteld. Omdat we niet wisten hoe we bij een hotel moesten komen zijn we maar uit nood op de AirPort zelf gebleven . Wat ons heel veel stress gaf. We hebben twee jongens ontmoet die dezelfde vlucht hadden als wij. Vanuit Bali naar Turkije en vanuit Turkije naar Nederland. 1 van die jongens heeft zijn moeder gebeld om Corendon te bellen. Corendon zou Turkish airlines bellen en als het goed is zou hij terug gebeld worden. Dat is nooit gebeurd. We zijn weer bij de balie in de rij gaan staan en daar kregen we met veel zuchten 1 bon per persoon om eten te halen. We konden daar alleen fast food mee halen en geen goede maaltijd. (Inmiddels al 4 km gelopen en ruim 5700 stappen verder, heel groot AirPort waar we van het kastje naar de muur zijn gestuurd.) En nog niet niet te spreken over hoe onvriendelijk ze zijn. Ik heb veel van mij last van zijn knie en toen we iemand moesten volgen werd er naar ons geschreeuwd dat het eigenlijk niet haar baan is om ons te brengen. En we hadden al drie keer aan haar gevraagd of ze iets rustiger wilde lopen. We zijn genegeerd en niemand wilde ons helpen. 11.30 bij foodcounter waar we vervolgens zonder dat er verder nog naar ons omgekeken is tot 18:00 hebben gezeten. Daarna na de gate gegaan en uiteindelijk konden gingen we 19:20 weg. Al met al zijn we ongeveer 36 uur onderweg geweest met een kleine maaltijd en veel ongemak. Wij hebben dit ervaren als een grote smet op onze vakantie en hopen dan ook dat Corendon deze zaak oppakt en nog iets voor ons kan betekenen.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Amsterdam via Istanbul,August 2023,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,False,Bali,Amsterdam,Istanbul

We were delayed 3 hours, This delay not only disrupted our travel plans but also caused us to miss important connecting flight and commitments upon arrival at our final destination of Madrid. Throughout the duration of the delay, there was a distinct lack of communication from the airline regarding the reasons behind the delay and the expected departure time. Passengers were left uninformed and anxious when most if not all had connecting flights. There was no clear information provided by staff. Additionally, when passengers inquired about the status of the flight at airport and on the flight, the staff exhibited lack of professionalism by saying nothing, and lack of concern for our well-being. Also once boarded, at no point did captain or cabin crew make an announcement apologising for the long delay and advise what to do when we all landed in Istanbul for our connecting flights. Upon arrival to Istanbul, again there was a distinct lack of communication or compassion from the airline staff informing the procedure to passengers on what to do and where to go within the airport to reschedule our failed connection flights. Everyone was left in a panic. Staff at Istanbul were unhelpful. Eventually when we all arrived at a desk to reschedule the missed connection flight, new tickets were issued, and we had to sprint as fast as we could through the airport to the gate for boarding. It was all a mad rush! While checking in for the return flight, we were flabbergasted when Turkish Airlines website advised our flight had changed, did we want to cancel or rebook. We called Turkish Airlines in Madrid several times, nobody answered, we sent several WhatsApp messages through the Smart App, and it wasn't surprising that Turkish Airlines never once replied to any of our messages.

Then when I boarded the 2nd flight to Bangkok which was an Airbus A330-300, the legroom was unacceptable for a 10 hour flight, the USB was not working on the flight, we ended up having technical issues as the TV screens were quite broken with slow quality. The real positive of this experience was the food and beverages which were alright. I think in the future I would be better off to fly with a 5 star airline for future travels.

I am 1.97m tall and wanted to pay for extra legroom seat in economy. During booking on website, the seat selection option flagged that those over 65 cannot book exit row. It's first time I've encountered this - having flown on many other airlines where exit row can be occupied by 16 or older and capable of assisting with evacuation. Having accepted that Turkish and some other airlines set a maximum age, I searched the seat plan (Airbus A330-300) and selected extra legroom seats by bulkhead (row 11) - not shown as an exit row. All seemed ok when I completed the booking and paid. Weeks later, I completed the on-line check-in (only possible 24 hours or less before flight) which showed our extra legroom seat allocation, but when printing boarding passes we discovered we had been allocated seats in row 36. The seat pitch is too small for me and most uncomfortable for 5 hour flight. Even painful when passenger in front reclines. There seems to be an unclear or unreliable booking process. Please be warned - if you are over 65 and require extra legroom then don't book Turkish Airlines - or pay more for business class. Another comment which might help some travelers - if you are transiting in Istanbul then make sure your next flight leaves you enough time for transfer. Our flight from Tashkent to Istanbul landed 20 mins late. It then took an unbelievably long 45 mins to taxi a long way around the airport to hardstanding. Another 10 mins to disembark aircraft. It then took us 30 mins walking at a fast pace through transit and bag scan to next boarding gate where passengers had already started boarding.

123,S Hartez,Singapore,2023-06-26,1,"My wife and I have the worst experience ever with Turkish Airlines. They delayed our first flight multiple times due to technical issues and finally after an entire night of delays they cancel the flight but they did not release our tickets to allow us to get reschedule our flights. So we spent all night on the phone with our booking agency and the airline help center but nobody can help us until Turkish Airlines start their shift the next day (not until 10am). When we return to the airport the next day we are told that we have been put on the same flight but when we get to the gate they are already delayed again. After about 30 minutes of waiting the staff have no answers and one of the gate employees even tells my wife ""If you want to make it to your destination on time you should book another flight with a different airline. Turkish Air will reimburse you because of the delays."" So with that bit of terrible advice, we book another flight and try to leave the airport to check in with the new airline. But at immigration we are told that we cannot leave as our tickets have not been released (again) by Turkish Air and we were supposed to be escorted by an airline employee to immigration to fill out paperwork so we can leave. We end up sprinting through the airport as we are told by the information desk that the delayed flight is now boarding. So we finally make it to Istanbul where a Turkish Airlines employee stops all passengers with connecting flights and says he will escort us to our gates. After leisurely walking us through the airport he points down a long corridor and says our gate is at the very end. So we sprint, once again, to the gate only to find that the gate has already been closed and they would not reopen it for the 10-12 passengers who needed the transfer. So we watched as the plane pulled off the jet bridge and onto the runway feeling like we had been slighted once again. In all, we are still trying to get our money back for the extra flight we booked under Turkish Airline's advice, and we had a horrible start to our summer holiday. No matter how cheap their flights are, we won't be flying Turkish Air ever again.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Amsterdam via Istanbul,June 2023,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,True,Singapore,Amsterdam,Istanbul

But you can't book that online like that, so I called TK customer service and asked how I should book that. The information was that I should book 2 tickets and reserve min 3 hours on the way back for the change in Istanbul. I did as instructed, booked the tickets and also had over 3 hours to change planes, arriving in IST 13:40, departing to PRG 16.45. In the weeks and months that followed, I kept getting text messages from TK saying they were changing the schedule, changing planes, etc. Most of them concerned changes of times because of the time change to daylight saving time, but one concerned the flight from AYT to IST where I was secretly rebooked on a later flight, which I unfortunately did not notice. There remained however still 1 h 45 min for the change, which is well enough. Already on the way to the airport I saw that the flight will be delayed. At the check-in, however, the boarding pass was issued to us also for IST-PRG and the luggage was checked through to PRG. The delay was then according to TK on 1 h 16 min, so quite that is not true, we took a long time to the arrival gate, where we arrived at 16:20. Already on the plane I asked several times how it would work with the connection and the last information was that I should grab the first TK employee at the exit and let him advise me. I did and the TK man at the gate told me to go to the departure gate as quickly as possible. Anyone who knows the new IST airport knows what that means. Nevertheless, we made it to the gate by 16:45 (we are both 68 years old and my last gold medal in the 5000 m run was several decades ago). But of course there was not a soul at the gate. Again I grabbed a TK employee, who referred me to the customer service counter, where of course the obligatory queue was waiting. When I showed the ""Pre-sorter"" my boarding passes, he told me immediately that no more flight today and I should wait here, so that TK look for a hotel and book new tickets. When it was my turn, the lady looked at my papers only briefly, and explained to me that I had no right to any compensation because I had booked 2 tickets. No one responded to my question about how I should have booked and they referred me to the ticket counter next door, where I had to wait almost 45 minutes for my turn. For 2 tickets to Prague they wanted $700! When I went to book the tickets online, I came up with around $500, but the lady told me she couldn't take that fare and I should book online. With the hotel and cab and dinner this story came me to over 600 € about 200 € more than the whole original booking. Since then I have been arguing with TK, repeating everything I'm sure 10 times already, but all I ever get to hear is the gramophone record: ""You were late at the gate and had 2 tickets, we are not to blame"". On my question, how I should have booked differently, is consistent just as little addressed as also to the fact that the TK customer service had advised me to do so.

When I called Turkish they stated I could cancel the entire ticket or go home on a different day, not much of a choice. I couldn’t get credit for the second leg, even though they only canceled the second leg. I moved my flight to one day earlier and left my trip on may 2nd causing me to incur charges for the hotel stay for a night I couldn’t use. Day of the flight the flight was delayed over an hour with only a 2 hour connection to my second flight on their airline. I asked if I would miss the connection and they stated I would not and the plane would be held because we would land about 6pm and the flight started boarding at 6:50 pm instead of holding the plane they had an agent get me off the plane as soon as we landed and I thought I was being rushed to my flight, but no they were rushing me to the lounge because they had already booked me on another flight the next day. So I lost another day of my vacation because I had to stay overnight in Istanbul. I also had to get a visa for Istanbul unexpectedly because I had to leave the airport. None of this was explained to me it all just happened. On May 2nd my return flight, we were headed to the airport and our cab driver told us our flight was delayed 2 hours.

So I asked to be booked on the flight for the 4th because the flight on the 3rd was canceled (my original flight home).

On the last flight we were told by ground staff there are not enough meals on board so we wont get any (only in case of leftovers) and we can write a complaint to the airline afterwards. When questioning the crew why we would not get any meal if we have a full price ticket, the board crew reacted very rudely and we received different answers, first as the flight is overbooked and then as we checked in as one of the last passengers (should not matter how many hours before we check as we had a valid full price ticket). At the end we received two meals, but which seemed to be from different passengers who didn't finish or want it, as several items were already missing, and one meal was already opened. However, we did not complain anymore and accepted it. Before landing another crew member came unsolicited to us again and kept arguing with us again in a very rude manner and we should be happy that we received anything and finally she left saying that's not her responsibility. In addition, we were traveling with an infant and did not get offered baby food, while other customers did. When filing a feedback with the airline afterwards, we only got the answer that they investigated but could not find any ""meal service irregularities"" on the flight and also no improper behavior of crew members (wonder how they investigate that). After some forth and back and only the typical prefabricated customer service answers and even some answers that have nothing to do with my complain (e.g. they said I should have informed the crew members - that was actually my complaint, and in a second answer that I would have to submit a doctors report) not addressing the issue at all, I gave up. It seems nobody is really reading the feedback, they only copy past some generic prefabricated answers. In addition, on the return flight our stroller that we left at the gate was handled without any care. We even saw from the airplane window how the stroller was tossed around while unloading (even ground staff I guess is probably not airline responsibility). The stroller and the basket had scratches all over the place. Even the rain cover that we put over to protect the basket to some extent was destroyed. Not to mention the delays of one hour sitting in the airline waiting for departure with an infant on each of our two flights. Overall, one of the worst flight experiences and one of the most impolite cabin crew. And even booked the more expensive TK ticket, compared to low-cost airlines for example, expecting better service in particular as we were traveling with an infant.

The aircrafts were an Airbus A350 and a Boeing 787 which were nice, spacious and seem in a good condition. The seats had plenty of legroom and space to have a pleasant trip specially on long flights but are similar to other major airlines. One issue about the business class seats is that we can't see from the windows because of the seat conception which is inconvenient for a lot of passengers. The flight attendants were not very service oriented and did not seem very friendly. Usually the crew start to take the meal orders before the plane pushes back but on my last leg they did it once the plane was airborne. The crew from and to Bali legs were a bit better. Some of them don't even ask if we needed something else or a drink during the meal service and they took a very long time take the dishes. I had to ask twice to get my drink and another time later for a coffee which was very long to have it. However the food was tasty and good.

Legroom is fairly generous too, sufficient without being luxurious. ",A321NEO,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon to Istanbul,May 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,,4,yes,True,Lisbon,Istanbul,

After getting all they needed, they refused to pay and closed the case. Again, I called customer service, and they put an objection on the case. My question is why they waste customer's time.

My original flight, TK717, was scheduled to fly from Delhi to Istanbul on Mar 30, 2023, at 6:20 AM, before continuing to Dallas and Toronto. Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to a technical issue with the fuelling system. Turkish Airlines provided accommodation and rebooked me on a flight via Air India. The problem arose with my additional baggage. I had already paid for an extra bag with Turkish Airlines, but they failed to carry forward this payment to my new flight with Air India. I had to pay for the same additional bag twice. I reached out to Turkish Airlines for a refund and compensation, but they directed me to Air Canada, claiming it was a codeshare flight operated by Air Canada. However, this is not true, as the flight I am talking about, TK717, was operated by Turkish Airlines. I have tried to communicate with Turkish Airlines multiple times, providing them with the correct information, but they keep diverting responsibility and have not resolved my issue. It is incredibly frustrating and disappointing to be treated this way by an airline I had trusted. Based on my experience, I give Turkish Airlines 1 star out of 5.

170,G Morrison,United States,2023-03-30,1,"We were loyal Turkish Airlines fliers for many years until this experience. Our saga started when we purchased 4 business class segments for my wife and my honeymoon in February 2022 for almost $8K. Due to Covid, we tried to change them over the course of the next year. This airline has arbitrary change fees that are not listed anywhere on their website. They are allowed to quote you whatever fees they would like at the time of the change request. As such, we were told that our new tickets would need to be roughly $5600 to qualify for the change, with an additional $600 per ticket change fees, so $9k in total for a $5600 flight. We agreed, but disputed the change fee with Amex. Amex found in our favor for $600, issuing the credit and we looked forward to our honeymoon. Fast forward, we arrived to the gate in February 2023 for our new flight and were told for the first time that our tickets were *suspended* and that we no longer had tickets. After speaking to ticketing agents and phone agents, both of which said there was nothing they could do (more on this later) we finally were able to speak to the Newark sales manager who was highly unprofessional and unhelpful, trying to convince us that we were not owed anything and essentially ""too bad"". In the end, we were forced to purchase last minute economy tickets for almost $4K with a one way upgrade for $2500, as we did not want to jeopardize our hotel reservation and ruin our honeymoon further. Over the course of the next 2 weeks, like many here, we emailed the feedback form many times (as others noted, this airline's phone personnel have no authority to make any financial decisions and all must be done via online feedback forms). We received many unhelpful responses, refusing to give us any compensation or help us in any way. All references were made to speak to ""our bank."" Finally, we decided to upgrade our economy leg home for another $2500 and take this matter up when we got home. In the end, we paid about $8600 just to have to pay another $8.5K and fly in two 8 hour economy segments versus the 4 business segments we originally purchased. I'm sure that in the meantime, Turkish resold our original seats last minute for much higher than the original $8k we paid 5 months before the flight. In short, this was the worst travel experience of our lives and showed clearly the unethical business practices of this airline. 1) They will suspend your tickets without notice, forcing customers to purchase last minute segments at the gate. There are numerous other cases here of flier having their tickets arbitrarily suspended. 2) You will not be able to make changes, receive refunds or do any customer service action of any value through the phone with them. You will be forced to use an antiquated online ""feedback form"" that does not even track your previous correspondence. There are no personnel in any airport, including in Istanbul that have the authority to issue flight changes, credits or refunds. 3) They do not have a clear change fee policy. If you need to change your flight, be prepared to spend months trying to communicate with them on the aforementioned form and in the end they can quote you any amount, you're on your own.

Unfortunately all of that is wasted by the fact that they fly old, outdated equipment with old, outdated 2-2-2 configuration with zero privacy from your seatmate and people crawling over you or you crawling over them to get to aisle unless you are on the center section. It's a shocker that TK hasn't remotely kept up with their competition in this regard. It's like flying business class in the 1990s. Power ports in inaccessible locations rarely work, seat controls inadequate. So instead of a review of 10/10 I'd love to give, it gets knocked down to 5/10 as a result of all of this. I would not use TK in this configuration unless there was no other choice or the price was very cheap. They desperately need a refresh of this old livery or just new planes. All four of my flights were old A330s that didn't even have privacy screens between seats.

On arriving in Istanbul, there was no apology or direction of what to do, I was stuck in the airport for almost 6 hours. There was no food or drink offered, no accommodation, just a new boarding pass. Having sat in an uncomfortable chair for the delay and waiting for the first flight out in the morning, my flight took off and arrived in Kayseri. I had a bad feeling at the luggage collection and just knew my bad luck was to continue. No sign of my luggage and the conveyor belt stopped. I was told to go to another location of the airport as my luggage was there. On arriving, I was told my luggage was still in Manchester and had not been loaded to my original flight. I registered my contact details and was given a reference number and number on Whatsapp. I was told my luggage would be there the next day. One night without my luggage wasn't ideal but manageable. The next day I whatsapped the number, which was Kayseri airport, not Turkish Airlines and they said it had not arrived and to contact the airline. I had to call an international number, costing me money each time, to get information on where my bag was. I was told later that day it would arrive. I got no call and followed up that day, no luggage. I was in Kayseri for 4 days and my luggage didn't arrive there at any point. 4 days without my own clothes, toiletries, shoes, etc. Each day, I received no communication from the airline and had to call them, at a cost, to see where it was. They had no idea and couldn't tell me where it was or when it would arrive. I had to go shopping on Day 3, to buy new underwear, clothes and shoes, as I could not wear the same clothes the whole time. The airline said keep all receipts for costs associated with this and I would be compensated. My luggage finally arrived in Istanbul airport, when I left Kayseri after 4 days and 4 nights without my luggage. It cost me over $200 to buy new clothes, taxis, phone costs, etc. It ruined the 4 days in Kapadokya.  On returning home, I tried to get compensation for the lost luggage, which has been a nightmare. They did compensate me for the delay, per EU rules, however they will not meet my costs for the delayed luggage, not even paying me enough to buy new clothes and essential items. They were responsible for ruining my holiday to Kapadokya, yet they will not compensate me for these 4 days, let alone meet the essential costs. No apology, no responsibility, just automated answers about how they love treating their customers as a priority and look forward to welcoming me again. I would avoid TK if there is another option, their customer service is severely lacking, they have no care for customers who want to enjoy Turkey and boost tourism.

Generally speaking, the flight staff on the plane are friendly, but that is the only positive thing about this airline. In my example, the flight was already rebooked on the outward flight because of Turkish Airlines. The situation continued on the return flight, when they once again rebooked the return flight two weeks in advance at inhuman times with eternal delays. As if that wasn't enough, they cancelled this already rebooked inhumane flight 10 hours before departure. Turkish Airlines only needed a short email to cancel without any possible contacts or other options. At the airport, the fun really started. Seeing that the flight was still available and that more and more people with the same problem were piling up, Turkish Airlines still didn't have enough reason to act. 10 minutes before the end of check-in, they were content to calmly do something.

Started with a very poor check-in experience using their appp, and wouldn't progress past the seat selection stage where it kept glitching so I had to do it on my laptop instead, and then the app wouldn't show the boarding passes. Then, at the gate despite an announcement saying boarding would be by seat number, it was simply a free-for-all and the staff didn't even try to order things. I was in the middle passengers to board the aircraft. As I was at the end of the tunnel just about to get on the plane, the airport staff brought down passengers with mobility issues or requiring assistance. Myself and another passenger stood aside as asked (and as you should do) to await these passengers being boarded. Turns out that was a big mistake - several other passengers pushed past us (and those with mobility issues), which is relevant later. When finally aboard, it was clear that the flight was overbooked as noone could find anywhere to put their bags and the queue in the aisle was very long and slow. The passengers who had shoved past were getting their bags slotted into the last remaining spaces by crew. I also noted one gentleman who had severe mobility issues and who had been brought to the aircraft by wheelchair being asked to move seats by a crew member and struggling to do so with no assistance. Then I was told that my bag would need to be put in the hold. I tried to protest, explaining that I had intentionally travelled long-haul with hand luggage only to avoid these waits at the carousel and potential delays and missed connections, and had had recent terrible experiences with this, but the crew were entirely unhelpful and just chucked lots of our bags in the hold. These are all people who boarded around the middle of the cohort, so I can only imagine how many bags were relegated to hold in total. There were no reminders from staff to remove important or disallowed items from bags before they were taken to the hold - hopefully noone left their passports in there! This was all followed up by one of the most uncomfortable seat experiences of my life - and that's coming from someone who can sleep pretty much anywhere. There was barely any legroom, the seats weren't particularly comfy and as soon as the person in front reclined even slightly the screen was practically in your face. Arm rests also in an odd position. No USB or other charging points which is quite unusual these days. Not woken for my meal, so didn't have anything, and was only lucky to catch someone's eye long enough to get a drink.

We flew from Los Angeles to Tashkent via Istanbul and back from Tashkent to Los Angeles after spending 2 weeks in Tashkent with 3 days stop in Istanbul. We really liked Istanbul and it's touristic attractions. We bought tickets via Expedia and I paid full price for my son's ticket. When checking in in Istanbul TK representatives told us that we have to buy new ticket for our son since the one we bought was a child ticket, but it has to be a baby ticket as our son is under 2 years old. They told us that on previous 3 hops TK made a mistake allowing our baby onboard and they sent us to to a ticket office where I got charged an additional 130 USD for a new ticket for our son. It's the kind of Turkish Bazar experience you get when you deal with TK. It was a very stressful situation for our family as we were almost late to our flight to LA. I was very angry and was not able to sleep during our flight to LA. It's a completely different experience with Turkish Airlines in other countries as in Tashkent/Uzbekistan and Los Angeles their representatives are more customer focused. 3 years ago I had another bad experience with Turkish Airlines in Istanbul when TK oversold tickets to our flight to Los Angeles. They push people who bought tickets in advance with cheaper rates to stay and chose a different flight making a priority for those who paid higher buying tickets closer to departure date. That creates a stressful experience for the passengers since they don't have seats on their boarding passes. They first push you that you don't have seat available and later gamble proposing bonuses to passengers to abandon a flight and you have to stand firm to take your flight. Somebody agrees at the end to abandon a flight. Our Turkish Airlines experience was so bad that it spoilt our impression about our vacation in Turkey.

They provided no explanation but simply that the flight has been cancelled. It is a nightmare to rebook. Their system is set up to make you frustrated so that you cancel the flight, and rebook at a higher price. They have other flights available that they will not give to you saying your class (Economy/Business A B C Z I) do not match. Shouldn't they accommodate the customers to their best since it is Turkish Airline's fault? Right before our vacation, it turned into a nightmare. So much stress because of their unprofessionalism.

207,J Barvan,Slovenia,2022-11-16,4,"Online check-in and baggage drop have been relatively smooth, boarding too. Flight staff had been seen arguing before take-off which gave passengers an uncomfortable feeling. Comparing to the hospitality we were experiencing in Japan, the flight staff has been rude, tired and forgetful. With the seat belt sign turned on, seating in a window seat, I kindly asked for a tissue I did not receive, despite reminding the stewardess once more. We had a slight delay in departure but we arrived on time, which I really appreciated. The aircraft was old, with narrow seats and not a lot of legroom. My friend who is 186 cm tall had a hard time seating in the middle seat. Despite expensive price for the tickets, Turkish does not allow to choose your own seat - not when you buy nor when you check-in. Seat prices were ridiculously priced, where the extra legroom cost almost 90 EUR per person, per flight. My food was served lukewarm and the fresh bread was served to our hands before we could use their wipes to clean them. Taste was acceptable, portions are somewhat generous but the ingredients were repeating themselves. That includes our return flight. Onboard wifi was for free for Miles&Smiles members, but only 10 Mb which is laughable. The internet speed was poor and after trying 15 minutes to connect to the WiFi service, I shut down my phone after 5 minutes of trying to read some news. Unacceptable for this day and age.

We arrived to the airport 6 hours prior to check in. The staff saw us there. When they started to prepare for check in we moved to the line for infants as we travel with three kids and one of them is just 2 years old. The woman at the desk started arguing with us that he looks older. Quite an argument! Then she asked if he has a seat - and if he has he’s not consider as an infant! Do you believe it? We buy a seat for our kids long before they are 2 because it’s the matter of convenience, not the age! Then, we moved to common line, but of course our place was already took by other passengers and the staff told we have to get to the end of the line. Seeing us with three young kids 7 and under, with two carts full of suitcases and knowing we arrived much earlier than other passengers they moved us to the end of the line! Should it be Lufthansa or even Turkish Airlines in Turkey they would let us pass through the infant line without any questions.

211,H Haddon,United States,2022-11-09,1,"They disregard responsibility for their mishandling of bookings. Their grievance process, which they call “Feedback”, is disconnected and frustrating. I will not use Turkish Airlines again. Turkish Airlines cancelled my return flight, yet never notified me. They say, by their “Feedback” email response, that they sent me a SMS about the flight cancellation on February 18, 2022. My text message log shows no such message. That would be a message that would have grabbed my attention and led me to make alternative arrangements. No contact from them was made by phone, email or text about this. They did have all of my correct contact information, demonstrated by several texts and emails received about small changes in my outbound flight time. I also was not notified at my outbound flight check in that the return flight was cancelled. No alternative flight was booked by Turkish Airlines. This led to my being stuck at the Tel Aviv airport, having to return to the city overnight, and flying out the next day: a 19 hour delay and extra $489 of expenses. Turkish Airlines denied all responsibility and did not provide any compensation. There was a United Airlines (a Star Alliance partner) flight 4 hours later than my cancelled flight, which I requested on the phone with a customer service representative and from the ticketing agent at the airport, but this was not granted. Customer Service by Feedback is a brick wall. It is all done by email, and their email response closes the case.  The phone customer service agents tell you that everything is handled by Feedback email. The Turkish Airlines website says that they aim to respond to Feedback within 1 week. This does not provide any assistance when you need it at the time of your travel. All of my responses to Feedback came more than 1 week after submission, and only after I called and was told that the response will be expedited. Feedback 1: after 3 weeks and no response, I called, and was told I need to send a new Feedback email. Feedback 2: Claim denied. They allegedly sent me a SMS on Feb 18, which was more than 14 days before my flight, and that absolves them of responsibility. Their email also says that they offered an alternative flight 2 hours later. Feedback 3: I submitted my text log from Feb 17 and 18 showing no message was delivered to me. I pointed out that I was at the airport at 6 am for my 8:30 am flight, I was not offered a 10:30 am flight that they say they offered me in February, and a 10:30 am flight did not connect with any flights from Istanbul to San Francisco.

My ticket from Panama City to Lima was with Copa airlines, which was booked by Turkish Airlines and it wasn't me who booked the tickets with Copa Airlines. Before the day of the flight, I was able check in online for my flight from Istanbul to Panama, however, their website wasn't letting me check in online for the other connecting flight. I had received a link from Copa Airlines as well to fill in health related details, and other questions on destination, citizenship, residency, etc. After filling all that, the website had clearly said ""no transit visa required"" for Panama. Next morning when I reached Istanbul airport, they gave me only the boarding pass for first flight. When I asked them for the 2nd one, they said I'll get that from Copa in Panama. They had also put my luggage until Panama, which I had asked them clearly if that could cause any issues. However, they said everything is fine. Finally at boarding, I was stopped from boarding saying that I need a visa for Panama because I'll have to get down to get my luggage and hence will need to exit the transit zone. When I said this is Turkish Airlines fault then as I had clearly asked them about luggage, the guy admitted it was messed up by whoever gave me boarding pass. However, then they made up some rule that because my return flight to London is not through Panama but rather through Amsterdam with KLM, hence I need a visa for Panama. I have no idea what rule is this and why should my return flight have anything to do with my transit visa. I asked them to show this in writing and they just wrote the reasons on my boarding pass! I asked them for written proof which can be validated and have been trying to contact them over this from the time I have returned back to London. They keep closing the tickets and do not still provide any proof. The latest ticket is still open since Sep 20th and they have just stopped responding. I lost a lot of money (close to 3500 GBP) because my return flight was not refundable and some of my plans/trips in Lima weren't refundable. These morons have still been hiding and do not respond.

219,W Lane,Bahrain,2022-10-08,3,"I flew from Bahrain via Istanbul to Naples for business. I returned via the same routing roughly a week later. The final leg of the return flight was via a Gulf Air codeshare. Turkish Airlines representatives on the aircraft were courteous. The aircraft seemed clean and generally well-kept. My luggage made it to its destination. It was not damaged. Their website made it relatively easy to select seats on the non-codeshare legs of my journey, and to do the initial check in process. Turkish Airlines does not administratively handle codeshares well. There is no online process on either airline to select a seat or upgrade the codeshare leg. The boarding passes are not valid on the codeshare flight and have to be reprinted at the gate. Gulf Air basically rechecked me in and re-reviewed my passport, visa, etc. At least my luggage checked through. Our flight returning to Bahrain departed the airport (Naples) a little over 30 minutes late for no reason that seemed apparent. Granted, Naples is a dumpster fire of an airport, and this did not help, but no one explained to us what was going on or why it was late. We still made it to the aircraft 10 minutes before take-off. There was no effort to get us back on time. There was no sense of urgency. No one explained to us what was going on. The overheads were stuffed completely full before even 50% of the passengers boarded. The crew started playing 'Tetris"" with the overheads to make stuff fit. This caused another 20-minute delay in Istanbul as someone's laptop was missing. It ended up at the opposite end of the aircraft. So now we are 50 minutes late, for no good reason, for a 1+40 connector at Istanbul. The crew in the cabin seemed unsure about what gate we were pulling into at Istanbul. For a codeshare flight international connector, it was impossible to pick two gates farther apart. Deplaned at terminal F, boarded terminal A. GPS tells me I walked (ran, actually) 1.6 miles gate to gate. If you keep people informed, they are less stressed.  Make every effort to be on time. This should be priority 2, right after safety. Enforce carry-on rules and manage the overheads. This costs time for no good reason. Clean up your codeshare process. I will now avoid codeshares with GCC and Turkish Airlines.

258,R Malescu,Romania,2022-08-24,1,"In January 2022 I booked on Turkish Airlines website 3 tickets for my family to fly from Bucharest (Romania) to Los Angeles with layover in Istanbul. The first flight was code-sharing (operated by Tarom airlines) while the second was Turkish Airlines. In April 2022 I received an email from Turkish Airline stating one of the flights has a new departure time (not important, 10 minutes time difference). I entered Turkish Airlines website to accept the change however it was not possible, the error message stated I should contact customer service to accept the change. I called customer service and told them I accept the change, the person I talked to said it is OK, he accepted the change for me. The next day I checked the reservation status on Turkish Airlines website and I noticed that for the 3 passengers I can see only 2 e-ticket numbers (the 3rd one was gone). I called customer service and after commenting that “your flight is in 4 months from now”, they said there is an error in the system and they submitted an internal ticket, it will be fixed in 1-2 weeks. I waited 1 week, no change so I called them several times over the following 2 months and also wrote emails to customer service. Finally on June 10 they wrote back to me saying: “We have checked our system logs and detected that there was a systematical error regarding the reissue of your ticket.” As solution the moved the 3rd passenger to a new booking (2 passengers on 1 booking code and the 3rd on a different booking code). I said than you and asked them to assign also the extra legroom seat I paid for to the new tickets. They confirmed they did. One day before the flight I tried to do the online check in. “Ticketing error” was the message, so I called customer service again. They confirmed in their system all looks good, no problem, I should not worry, I can check in at the airport. On the day of flight, we arrived early at the airport in Bucharest and spent 1 hour with the check in supervisor in Tarom because she was not able to check us in for the flight as the tickets were messed up. In the end (30 min before take-off) she managed to check us in for the flight to Istanbul and said we should get the next boarding pass in Istanbul airport. We ran through the airport and managed to board the flight. In Istanbul at Transfer Desk they gave us the boarding passes for the Los Angeles flight. I said I want to make a formal complaint, however the lady at the transfer desk was not sympathetic at all, she did not care at all, she said I have to call/ write customer service for that.

267,C Bayer,Australia,2022-08-16,7,"I usually always love flying with Turkish Airlines but my latest experience left me disappointed. I was travelling on a codeshare ticket with Malaysian Airlines. This meant I was unable to do online check in before arriving at the airport. I received an unusual text from Turkish Airlines about 20hours prior to departure if I would like to give my seat up and get a refund to go to the Denied boarding office at Istanbul airport. No phone number or any way to discuss this offer further. I checked in at the airport 3 hours prior to departure and was told there are no seats for me. Flight is overbooked and to go to the gate and wait there. I feel this situation should be handled more carefully by the ground staff. I appreciate flights get overbooked but they need to explain this arrangement better. The agent clearly didn’t want to go over how it works, just that if I don’t get on the flight I’ll be looked after with accommodation and booked on another available flight. At the gate the ground staff again were not so helpful and just told a few of us to wait to one side once all passengers boarded (around 6 of us were in the same situation and all on codeshare flights!). They accepted us on the flight and explained some connecting passengers landed too late to make it to the gate in time.

On the way from Singapore to Tel Aviv, the flight was fine. The staff were rude, but the in-flight entertainment and the food were really good. On the way back though - it was a disaster from start to finish. First, we arrived at Ben Gurion Airport to check-in. I was travelling in a group booking with 20 other students. The Turkish Airlines staff member checked in 11 of us, and then said ""sorry the flight from Istanbul to Sydney is full, the rest of you are on standby.' We were travelling on a study program and couldn't be separated, but they didn't care. Apparently the flight had been overbooked by about 15-20 people. We were all still able to get from Tel Aviv to Istanbul without any issues. We were delayed by two hours in Tel Aviv because a Turkish Airlines staff member locked themselves outside at our gate. They had to wait for someone to let them inside. The person who came to let them in locked themselves outside. So, now we had two Turkish Airlines staff members locked outside. About two hours later, they were both let back inside and we could finally get on board to Istanbul.  In Istanbul, 7 of the 9 remaining students were able to get on a flight - including myself. I didn't know I'd even be on the flight until 5 minutes before the plane started to take off. It was actually me that was meant to be on standby, but one of the other students volunteered as a tribute in my place. They forgot to give me my luggage receipt (which I didn't even think to check until boarding). This made my lost luggage extremely difficult to track once I arrived back in Australia. Thankfully I did manage to get my luggage back after a 8 hours on hold and 11 days of waiting.

We were in transit at IST and arrived at the gate ahead of time before boarding started for our next flight to CPH. After the boarding queues had reduced we approached the desk to board only to be very abruptly told the gate was now closed and we must stand aside. The gate staff then proceeded to process standby passengers and allow them to continue to board the plane. We stood directly at the counter next to them and watched with disbelief as the gate staff re-assigned our seats to standby passengers and allowed them to continue to board. No-one even bothered to look at our boarding passes or acknowledge any of our requests for help or offer any explanations. We were just shouted at repeatedly that the gate is closed (and I do mean shouted at). We were told to leave the area and go to a service desk which proved to be a roulette wheel of disappointment & frustration resulting in TK saying there was no availability and we must wait at least 72 hours to continue our journey and simply ignored our request for any hotel recommendations or even entry visa assistance for Türkiye (we were in transit). After much back & forth and coaching the ‘help’ staff in searching for alternative routes we managed to find a flight to AMS later that same day. Incredibly, TK then made us pay for a ‘new’ ticket rather than reroute our existing one. And the final cherry on the customer service cake was then being informed that when we arrive in Amsterdam we must find another airline and source and pay for the final flight to Norway ourselves as TK could not help with that route (special thanks to KLM who were very understanding and helpful). In summary it cost us an additional $4000 USD to reach our end destination despite holding valid tickets & boarding passes for all our original TK itinerary. We are all still dumb-founded at how rude and indifferent the TK ground staff acted and treated their customers.

Mexico immigration clearly says that a person having a valid Schengen Visa does not require a Mexico Visa to for short-term travel to Mexico. Following the rules, the Turkish Airlines staff boarded me and issued boarding passes from BOM to IST and IST to CUN. I reached IST and when I reached the boarding gate of my Mexico flight, I was denied boarding by the Turkish Airlines staff citing that the Schengen Visa must be used before to travel to a Schengen country before flying to Mexico. This self made logic of theirs is ridiculous because firstly - 1) Mexico govt simply mentions that any type of multi entry Schengen Visa is accepted. 2) A Visa is not an obligation to travel, if I got a Schengen Visa that does not bound me to travel to Europe. 3) Also, I know a couple of my friends who also flew to Mexico on their unused Schengen Visa with other Airlines and they were allowed entry to Mexico without any hassles at the Mexico airport immigration. After I was denied boarding at Istanbul (IST) airport gate, I was made to run behind counter after counter but no one in the Turkish Airlines staff actually knew how to handle this situation and they demonstrated an utmost level of hostility and lack of empathy.

Flight was delayed and missed connecting flight. Hotel was given but visa needed to be obtained and paid by the passengers. The visa process is cumbersome. It can only be applied online and paid with a credit card. There is no option to obtain visa at the airport and make cash payment. Their card acceptance system is poor. Turkish Airlines does not help in any way to facilitate the visa process even though the flight was missed because of delay on their part. The food at the free hotel was not edible and we had to order room service and pay out of pocket. Half of the people do not get to use the free hotel because they are not able to navigate the evisa process which is required to cross immigration and reach the hotel desk. They make you wait about 45 minutes after you put you name down for free hotel at their desk. The hotels are at least 45 minutes ride from the airport. So, even after you are able to navigate their cumbersome evisa process, it takes about 2 hours to get to your hotel room after you put your name down at the hotel desk for free hotel.

I was constantly walking around during the flight to make sure my dad was doing okay as I was concerned about his health. I am a petite size lady with a small body frame. For my size, the seat was very small and uncomfortable for long flights (8 and 11 hour flights).  The food served to me was horrible both ways. During my return flight, I had even bigger issue!

Although it was rescheduled and canceled a couple of times, I contacted them more than ten times to reschedule my ticket. (when I buy tickets from Turkish Airlines, I always have the same issue, they are so unorganized and we have to call several times to fix the issue). Never mind, forget about this. Finally, after talking with rude Turkish Airlines representatives, we fixed the date for the 7th of July, from Detroit to Tabriz. (It was three connective flights). On the 7th of July, we were so happy that everything was fine and finally we were leaving the country for our wedding. I and my husband went to the airport and noticed that the flight that Turkish Airlines gave us was fake and there isn't any flight with that number in the airport system! Everybody at the airport desperately looking for the flight and all the people at the counter and even the airport police were shocked when they checked our tickets. We arrived at 5.30pm at the airport, we called Turkish Airlines customer service from 6 pm to 2 am! You can't imagine what happens, we talked probably with 15 agents, and 4 of them hung up the call, others were yelling at us and were so rude that this is not our fault and we can't fix it. Let's make the story short, all of the representatives said that there isn't any flight on the 20th July from any city in America to Iran. Representatives said to pay $4000 each to give us business class for the next day or we refund your ticket! We spent $50,000 on our wedding, guests were invited and we planned everything, but all of our plans were ruined by their big mistake! I got an anxiety attack at the airport and the police gave me water and asked me to be calm and relax! I call my family in Iran to say to cancel the wedding and they were shocked too. My brother lives in Turkey and he urgently rushed to the Turkish Airlines office in Istanbul, he said you must use their established yelling system so that somebody helps you, otherwise, they don't help with talking and they don't even say sorry for their big mess. Although they said we don't have an available ticket by the 20th of July, my brother bought a ticket for the 11th of July (with the same yelling method that Turkish Airlines representatives taught us).

On 30th April 2022 I've been denied to board on my fly because, according to Turkish Airlines database, I couldn't fly to Doha without the pre-registration to the Qatar Covid website. As I carefully checked before flying the Qatar government updated the Covid regulations in March 2022 with new regulations for EU citizens fully vaccinated, whose don't need pre-registration to enter the Country anymore and even Turkish Airlines website was reporting the same guideline for Qatar at the time I flew. I waited 3 hours at the airport that the Turkish office opened for the next fly and I explained the whole situation to the receptionist on shift who immediately understood the situation. As he was reading the same guidelines on the system, which didn’t match the Qatar government website, he immediately sent a message to the DOP in Doha to get confirmation about whether the “pre-registration” was compulsory for EU citizens. Unfortunately, for me, the answer didn’t arrive until the next day, so I decided to leave the airport at 7:30 pm waiting to be contacted and see if I could fly on next day. The following morning at 9am I received a call from the ticketing office confirming that I could board the plane to Doha without “Pre-registration” and that there was an available flight on the same day (1st of May). I was right and I could fly, after spending the whole previous day at the airport because the airline mistake.  I've been trying to explain all this situation to the online customer service, asking compensation under EC Regulation 261/2004.

It was our first time flying with TK and it was a good experience, overall. One thing to note, both their website and app was absolutely useless for online check-in. On both flights, they did not note down my request for a child's meal and both times we couldn't complete online check-in, which resulted in us waiting in long queues to receive our boarding passes at the airports at YOW and KUL. Both outbound and inbound flights from Canada and Turkey were relatively full, which was expected with borders opening up all around the world. Our flight from YYZ to IST was delayed twice at the 11th hour due to the incoming flight from IST coming in late and this was not communicated clearly by the ground the staff as passengers had queued up twice, before being told of the delays. Our flights out of IST and KUL were both on-time, with boarding completed quite swiftly. Once we boarded the plane, this is where I find TK excels, both the B773 and A359 had really comfortable seats, new IFE systems, pretty delicious food, and very friendly and attentive crew, as they made sure my toddler was as comfortable as she can be for the flights. We were well fed, the seats were super comfortable and a whole assortment of videos and games were available to keep us entertained during our flights. Not too many airlines hand out menus, provide stainless steel cutlery, or an amenity kit in Economy anymore, but these guys still do! I would also recommend TK to traveling families as they were very attentive and approachable to me and my toddler, with any of our requests. On one of the flights, one of the stewards even assisted with carrying out our luggage to the door, as he noticed I was occupied with my toddler and had multiple carry-on luggage on myself. Only slight comment, was their lavatory garbages needed to be emptied more frequently and they sometimes didn't have enough milk boxes or certain type of meals for the passengers. The TK ground staff is where I feel they need to improve the most, if they want to compete with the likes of QR or EK. Both at IST and KUL their staff was nowhere to be seen after security screening as they made no announcements for priority boarding for traveling families and disabled passengers and announcements were never made to inform passengers that the planes were ready for boarding either. The TK ground staff at KUL showed no urgency to manage the long queues of people who were unable to complete online check-in and also did not seem interested in processing these passengers as quickly as possible. Ground staff for our IST-YUL flight was so clueless and unhelpful that passengers started arguing at the gate with them, as they were not managing priority boarding to families and disabled passengers correctly, which should be a normal process for full service airlines.

Disembarking passengers were not offered much direction on which bus to get on. The bus ride took another 10 minutes and by this time the connecting passengers were scrambling for their flights. TK should be ashamed for forcing their customers to take a bus when the aircraft is sitting 10 feet away from an air bridge.

I received the relevant confirmation in an email stating clearly that my party of 5 were all checked in and were allocated seats A to E in row 23, flight TK4330. I went to print off the boarding passes and was only able to print off mine and my elder sons but on clicking the other members of my group a message was displayed stating that boarding passes were unavailable right now but they would be available to collect at the Turkish Airlines check in desk. I tried from my laptop, my ipad using the Turkish Airlines App and my son's friends android phone again using the app. Each time I was prompted with the same message stating that each of the 3 other boarding passes would be available at the check in counter.

A couple of days later they cancelled the return flight, sent me a message, asked me to login and change it. Online change was not possible, system did not allowed. I had to call their call center in Istanbul. Staff very poorly trained. One made some changes for me, but sent me wrong and incomplete emails, something was clearly wrong. Had to call again. Second adviser said the first adviser was wrong and you had to cancel the whole booking. They kept me on the phone for 40 mins. You had to stay on the phone. Cancellation was done, again not properly, only partial cancellation, they could not cancel the whole lot, don't ask why. I told them that their own prices now are about £600 more expensive, they don't care, they said if you want to book you have to pay (while my money is still stuck with them, remaining credit card balance not enough for a second booking ). While money was taken in 2 lots, it is coming back in more than 50 separate transactions, very confusing, some transactions are £3 others over £400. Very bad service. I had to go into their office in Manchester airport, wasting about one and half hours, also paying airport charges for car park, to try confirm and correct the cancellation. It took about 7 to 10 days for money to come back after that, still missing small amount. It was very stressful and bad experience, wasted a lot of time also a lot of money, the new booking is about £800 more expensive than the original which Turkish airline cancelled.

The boarding process at ORD was a little chaotic as it appeared passengers ignored the pre-boarding request for business class only. Turkish Airlines business class product is exemplary. The seating is the old configuration of open side by side seats which don't offer much privacy if you're seated next to a stranger. The service was excellent with a personal chef taking dinner orders. This was followed by a beverage service (juices/lemonade) and warm mixed nuts prior to pushback. Hot towel service provided before dinner with a table cloth laid out on the tray. Dinner consisted of smoked salmon courgette, steak and arugula salad and fresh fruit. After dinner, an amenity kit was provided with a turndown service (individually packaged comforters) converting seats into a fully lie flat bed. I was able to turn to the side and sleep comfortably. The remote worked flawlessly. The TV screen is a large 17"" display. The Denon headsets provided good noise cancellation and sound.

Our original 1:15PM boarding time passed w/o any communication from the gate attendants. We were given numerous boarding times until we were told hours later that the flight was canceled due to a mechanical issue. We returned to the ticket counters to rebook. There was not enough staff; same people who originally/secondly checked us in, were at the gate and also checking in the next flight. The chaos/disorganization among the way the whole ordeal was handled was SO unprofessional . Passengers were instructed several times to move to different lines causing people to lose their places in line; causing more frustration. Since the flight did not show up online or on the app as canceled but rather delayed, we were not able to rebook on our own, even though we had been told it was canceled. The next step we were told to follow was to leave our places in line and go to the baggage claim and bring our luggage back to the check-in counter. The explanation for this was that when we get rebooked, the staff would be able to quickly tag our luggage. Once again, the lines were jumbled and people were angry. The passengers that were in the front of the line lost their places, and many were now in the back. Two areas were made for passengers wanting to cancel their flight and ones who wanted to rebook. We stood for hours.  People who ordered business class felt entitled to cut the line and did so with impunity. We returned the following morning at 7am and no attendants showed up for an hour. Next flight was to depart at 1:45 PM. Crew finally showed up at 2:25 PM. At 2:45 PM a bus to took us to the aircraft, and at long last, at 3:34 PM the plane started moving. At 3:43 PM the crew informed the passengers that we were returning to the gate due to Mechanical Issues.

It was a ~11hrs journey, hence decided to pay extra to get extra legroom seats for both flights. The selection was made based on the online layout provided by the airline during booking. Based on the given layout (attached), I selected seat 24D. It looked like one with extra legroom because there was a gap for emergency exits between Rows 23 and 24. However, the actual layout differed. Seats 23D, E, F were right in front of 24D, E, F, and there was no extra legroom. Tried to highlight the issue to the flight attendant but was told that I am seated in the seat I had reserved. Communication in English was difficult, so I gave up. Tried to highlight the issue via online feedback to request a refund of the SIN-IST flight and change my return flight to a proper extra legroom seat but was unsuccessful. In two subsequent online feedbacks, tried to get their acknowledgment that their online layout was misleading and issue a seat selection refund for SIN-IST, but they refused to answer the formal and just reply to the latter with the similar answers that they provided me with the seat I reserved, so a refund was not possible. The same happened on my return flight. It was just impossible to get my message across to the ground staff and the flight attendants.

In 2019 my father got severely ill and I have booked a same day flight from JFK to OTP via IST. The first flight to IST was 3 hours delayed and we got late for the second flight. We were 5 people on the same flight going to the connection. Even though plane was still at the gate we were denied boarding. I begged them to let us thru that I had an emergency but we were booked on a flight 7 hours later. Needless to say my dad passed away 3 hours before my arrival without the possibility of saying our goodbyes. Now back to my May 2, 2022 flight it was a horrible experience. I have booked my ticket 3 months in advance to be able to get seat 2A. As soon as I boarded the plane and settled in my seat, seat 2B passenger came and asked me to switch with his female companion who had 5A because they were just upgraded and had no seats together. I told him I rather not as the seat is located next to pantry closet, galley and toilets but he quickly went to a flight attendant and spoke Turkish and in less than a minute I was ordered not asked to change my seat to accommodate. Once I was obligated to move to 5A I realized that nobody was seated on 5B cause boarding was complete. I asked why was I moved when they could have both seat on 5A and B and I was bluntly responded that they preferred row 2. Are you kidding me I paid several thousand dollars for the ticket to be taken my seat away. Then once in the air I have tried to recline my chair which to my surprise was not working.

Met by disinterested crew upon boarding, could have tried harder to welcome passengers. Big Boeing 777-300, interior appeared clean, was less than a quarter full.

The cabin crew were friendly and they worked very hard due to a full cabin. But it's the food which was outstanding, plentiful and very tasty.

The representatives at Istanbul are rude, mis-informed and have no clue of the process. My Kuwait flight from Delhi was delayed that led to change in the complete itinerary. Since complete journey was booked through Turkish, I was hoping to get some help from Turkish Airlines. The staff refused to acknowledge that my situation was due to delayed flight. Instead of helping me, they started questioning me on why I did not take another flight from Kuwait to Istanbul. The lady at customer service refused to listen and was referring to mail sent few weeks back - which mentioned about 5 minutes change in schedule. I tried to reason that situation was due to delayed flight that no one would know 3 weeks ahead, but she refused to listen. Another representative questioned me on why I did not take other flight from Kuwait - even after explaining that it was Turkish ticket and we took 1st flight that was offered. There was no Turkish desk at Kuwait. Communication is another big issue. The attitude of representatives were to push customers to any direction without giving them proper information.

Since we have a baby under 2 and she needs her own seat, we can not book online. The system does not allow this. So we have to call the customer service. I had to call them 23 times (no joke) because a couple of times their system crashed after waiting 10-30 mins on the phone. Other times because the system is so slow, it took me 40 minutes to get an answer. And at the end nobody could explain to me why there was such a huge difference in the ticket prices that I have to pay on top. They were giving me the break down of the price: how much I pay for taxes, base fare etc.. and it did not add up to the difference and they could not explain why. I wrote a feedback to ask for it, after 5 emails, there was still no answer. Now despite this ridiculousness, I still continue my booking because I do not want to lose the original tickets.

349,Jennifer Zikic,United States,2022-04-21,1,"This has been the worst travel experience ever. It started with the call center confirming our seats the day before travel from the first section of the plane to the end of plane upon check in. We were told boarding was delayed for hours until they finally canceled the flight Los Angeles to Istanbul. We were told to go to the ticket counter for assistance. Needless to say herds of us headed that way only to encounter chaos. No one from Turkish airlines had a contingency plan or a way to establish order. The flight that was checking in was stopped as all employees vanished for a long time. The call center was of no help since they just said the flight is delayed when i am looking at the ticket counter and see the flight canceled info. We were told by an employee to form a line in one stop to be changed to another spot 20 minutes later. Then to be told to go collect baggage and return in order to be attended. Meanwhile there were other travelers who stayed and demanded help which they received (they were traveling to Tel Aviv). My husband and I went to collect baggage and came back to ticket counter. With the same story of form a line here and then there and then moving it yet again, all the meanwhile this group was being assisted the whole time while no one else had this treatment. We finally got tickets for the next flight to Istanbul. We were separated by half a plane for the 13 hour flight. While getting settled in I noticed the same group of people being very demanding to the flight attendants causing them to be unavailable for other passengers due to all their demands. The most turbulence ever on a flight. Upon arrival to Istanbul we encounter 2 flights held awaiting passengers from our flight however ours was not held (which was scheduled to leave even later than the Tel Aviv flight and Barcelona) Our connecting flight was for Belgrade. We were given the biggest runaround through the airport to try and get assistance for next flight to Belgrade and hotel accommodations. After hours we arrive at a hotel in downtown area where now it was midnight and nothing was open. Stranded without food, toiletries and clean clothes. We were picked up 3.5  hours later and dropped off at the airport. No one could help me from Turkish airlines in the Turkish airport!  Arriving to Serbia I called the call center from Serbia to be told my ticket numbers have changed and that is why can’t access my flights on the app or website any longer. Even with the new numbers still have the same problem. I could not select return flight seats over the phone or online. I was told i had to go to the main office in Belgrade. My husband is 6’6” and needs extra leg room. Not an option. I sent emails to complain about situation and try to receive help to only be told “we are sorry for inconveniences”. Needless to say I am in Belgrade to try and receive help at their office. Worse service ever! “Due to covid” no one in office can do anything other than ticket purchases. I am dreading the flights back home. I will encourage any and all people thinking about traveling with Turkish airlines to reconsider. It might be more money up front but it will be better in the long run. This has been a cloud over our whole trip.

350,O Tavalloli,Canada,2022-04-20,1,"I was denied flight back to Canada from Istanbul. I was stranded in the airport with no one helping me. I had to wait for the next flight which was 2 days later. This caused me extreme anxiety, stress and unnecessary extra costs to my trip. I believe Turkish Airlines should compensate me for time, money loss and for pain & suffering. They have very poor customer service online and on the phone. As well their customer service agents in the airport are very rude, and abrupt. They made derogatory comments to me in Turkish the customer service agents definitely do not help their customers. I made a complaint to the company and I’m still waiting for a response. Upon my arrival in Istanbul airport on Monday February 14th I immediately called Turkish Airlines for reservation for my cat. I was told (though the representative asked me of the breed and the size of my pet I provided) that the cabin had reached its capacity limit and that the only option I had was to put my cat in the holding cargo. The representative even told me that I must have a hard carrier for my cat since she’s going to be put in the cargo. She then reserved a spot for my cat and told me that I’d receive an email confirmation for the requests. I received two emails. First email was for the cabin and it was not confirmed due to full capacity but second email was confirmed for cargo. The representative did not tell me that my cat was not allowed in the cargo and went ahead with the reservation. Based on the confirmation I received from Turkish Airlines I proceeded with my flight as usual on February 16th. I was held for the entire duration of the check out at Turkish airport with many different excuses from several different agents and scenarios and no clear explanation why I couldn’t fly at that time. The first reason was that my cat couldn’t be in the cargo area because there was a large dog and then the other reason was that I didn’t have sufficient documents and then they said that Because of my cat’s breed (exotic shorthair) I hadn’t reserved for my cat far in advance. I was extremely stressed out and the frustration was unbearable and above all my cat was in a lot of distress and hunger and thirst and no where litter box for her toilet. The Turkish Airlines staff were extremely unprofessional, unhelpful, and rude with me. They all refused to provide me with their name.  I experienced the worst customer service from a big company that I once thought they were a decent airline to fly with. This whole issue started all internally within the airline and no one wanted to help out. I was told by customer relations to wait in the airport until management team calls me to provide me with hotel, transportation, and my next flight for free of charge because this was the airline error and not mine.

A better job of cleaning was needed: I found two used masks in the seat pocket.

I asked the guy over the phone if I can just cancel seat selection since I was not charged what I was told. He said no because of our policy. My question here is why I was shown a different price and charged for a very different price?

After 2 hours of waiting, we were informed that my wife’s and son’s tickets could not be changed to other airlines since the ticket was bought with a voucher. A voucher we got last time when Turkish Airlines took us off a flight!! I then explained to the staff that we could not sit 4 days in a hotel with my wife's knee only getting worse and worse and that my son also had school to attend. We contacted Turkish Airlines in Bahrain who also tried to change the ticket with no success. At this time, 5 hours had passed, and no solutions were given to us to get us home to Bahrain.

384,O Tamer,Australia,2022-03-10,1,"Turkish Airlines profited from my fathers death on their plane. My parents were travelling from Istanbul to Sydney with a stopover in Malaysia KL. For unknown (according to Thailand Doctors) reason my father died on the plane and the plane made an emergency landing in Phuket Thailand. They sent my dead father and mother to the hospital by ambulance even though he was dead for a couple of hours. We received one phone call by the hostess to say they were being taken to hospital and confirming my father had died already even though Turkish airlines have in their reports that he died in hospital. I'm guessing to avoid any responsibility. For the next several hours, every family member including grandkids were calling Phuket hospitals trying to find my mother. Imagine your 72 year old mother who has severe asthma, Crohn's disease and has had triple heart by-pass surgery stuck in a foreign country with high humidity with limited English. No thanks to Turkish airlines we tracked down my parents to a hospital ourselves. We are grateful for the Thai people whom were very nice to my mother. They police took her to the hotel across the road which was kind of them. However, my mother who had just lost her husband of nearly 55 years, in complete numbness and shock had to stay 3 nights in Thailand until a negative Covid test came back. That was the earliest I was able to get my mother out of there. Costs - Hotel & food about $300, Covid test $200, Compulsory Insurance during the brief stay $300. Now comes to my father, I received an invoice to the amount around $5,760 which around $2,500 was to go to Turkish Airlines fees to repatriate my father back to Turkey. We asked Turkish airlines to take some responsibility and at least waive their fees. They said no. So family members chipped in and paid the total bill. And even though Turkish airlines is profiting by $2,500, they have not apologised and accepted any responsibility in the way my mother was dumped and treated, not to mention keeping family members in the dark.

No email, App update, phone call or correspondence for this delay whatsoever. How we came to know about this is the flight update screen at the airport which we thought was glitching as expected time was showing as expected but had another value of time in front of it which was odd so hence we inquired at customer service.  Customer service was the most demeaning, inhumane and stressful experience. We couldn't even make it to the desk before an airline rep pulled us out asked our flight number and without any info about what's going on? what are our options? asked a question to us ""Food? Yes? No?"" I replied just want to understand our flight situation as nothing is updated or conveyed to us. He replied No food? Ok passport? I gave him the passport thinking ok some resolution finally but he took it went behind the desks, vanished there in the back in the kiosk and came back after 15 min. Asked me again, Food? I said  what's up with flight?. So again we got back in the line up so we could talk to a human maybe. Reached a lady finally, nicely asked about what's going on with flight and what are the options, accommodations. Lady said the flight that was at 9 is now in the morning (it took me good long time to get this info) she said no hotel we don't accommodate. Anyways back and forth she got agitated and threatened to call police which Ironically I should be calling as I was being robbed. I stepped back because if this was customer service imagine how police would be. Went to another line again now this time a gentleman, pretty straight forward told me he doesn't deal with that side of the business but can help me give options and the options was a substitute flight that will go to a different city and we need to figure out on our own from there. Which of course we took as I wanted to be out of there ASAP. Every single person in that line up, regardless of my flight or a different destination was extremely frustrated, crying or with hopeless face. So it wasn't just us with our first world problems I guess. On the way back to Canada (from Lahore to Istanbul to Toronto).  Without any notification our morning flight got 8-9 hours delay, we came to know about is due to my previous incoming experience this time I kept checking online status of departures through airports website because as usual Turkish Airline website and app were still showing on time. The Turkish airline office in Lahore does not open at times that displays on their site and there is no local number, agent or helpline to update your ticket when they delayed and messed up all the connections. (and no no email or updated itinerary) Anyways so we reached with all our luggage at airport just in case you never know. They finally open at 5 am instead of 2 am which the site said. Somehow squeezed in and found a number to call. International number, not toll free and the call keeps dropping, my wife successfully got hold of someone and they said they don't have connection to Toronto until Sunday which was after 2 days so either we leave Lahore on the delayed flight and stay Istanbul.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Lahore via Istanbul,February 2022,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Montreal,Lahore,Istanbul

I called the airline and they said I would have to make it an open ticket and call back when I am ready to book. They said it would be no problem. A few months later I called because I had a sudden break in my work schedule and could finally book a vacation. First time i called I was in the middle of the reservation and the call got disconnected. I called back to make the reservation and they said that it looked like I was a ""no show"" on the flight. I knew that was untrue. The agent said i needed to make a feedback request, I did and it did report an ""irregularity"" in the system. So then I was feeling hopeful I called to book. I cannot even tell you how many times I have had to call. A few times ""The system was down"" Then when I called back (each time I would get a different agent) they would say I cannot book this ticket because your name was wrong. My last name was written twice on reservation. They said please make a feedback request and they will change your name then you can book, so I did that. The feedback online sent to me via email was that they cannot change my name and i have to make a new reservation to do so. So I called back to make the reservation and asked them to please correct the name they said sure, we will forward the call to the feedback department. Feedback department said no sorry we cannot help you you need to do this online. So I booked the reservation on phone. She said just make a feedback online to change name. She refunded me $500 because new ticket was less. So again I made a feedback online, they wrote me back today saying You have to book your route again with the new name. Well how can i do that now that I have already paid for the flight! They said you can call us back or book online. Well I tried to book online and it asks for hundreds of dollars (asking like it is a new flight), so then I call. I spoke to someone, she did not even say hold on she just said okay I'll help you, she transferred me to another agent. That person said okay I will help and then never came back on the line!

But the customer service representative keep telling me my flight is not cancelled and scheduled on time for next 12 hours. 12 hours before my flight, the customer service representative (after hours of time spent in phone calls) told my flight was cancelled and I am compelled to buy another expensive ticket from Qatar Airways.

399,Frank Carroll,Ireland,2022-01-31,1,"I write from your Business Class Lounge in Istanbul. Having arrived at the airport at 11 pm the night before to take the flight TK 0692 from Istanbul to Cairo the check-in staff member insisted that a PCR test was the only way we could take a flight to Egypt. They refused the certificate of full vaccination issued by the European Union and I quote this certificate was irrelevant. We were informed that the only way we could travel to Egypt was to take a PCR test at the airport and await the results My colleague and I have no choice to comply with this false demand to complete our journey. We took the PCR test at our own expense. We then had to wait for the results. We returned to the Business Class check in where we had to rebook our flight at 7.30 am six hours later. We were informed that my ticket was going to cost an additional €450 citing that the ticket had been changed 4 times already. This I might add was because Turkish airlines had already cancelled my flight from Malaga to Istanbul 4 times leaving us stranded at great expense. After further debilitating stress. We finally managed to re-book our tickets on the much later flight at 07.30 am. During the process, I had asked to speak to a manager or supervisor. No one was available to help, and the attitude of your agent was beyond rude. It was stressful and humiliating. I am of advanced years and the stress caused has had a very negative effect. During the debacle of your insistence on the now proven unnecessary PCR test, it was suggested that once we arrived at the so-called “Business Class Lounge” we should ask to speak to a manager. When we explained our situation the ridicule continued, and the reception staff after a minute on a mobile phone search reiterated that a Covid Certificated issued by the European and the Egyptian government was irrelevant and a covid PCR test was the only we could travel. This compounded the stress of the whole situation when again the risk of refusal to board might again be insisted upon. I cannot express the level of my feeling of stress and humiliation given by your staff's superior attitude. Apart from being worn out by your treatment, we are at the loss of the cost of the unnecessary PCR tests and the additional fee for rebooking. Not to mention the already 4-day delay on the first leg of our flight at great expense.

402,A Wajaran,United States,2022-01-26,1,"Be careful with the way you ticket with this airline. Forbid you have a voucher for a reimbursement for future use or whatever reasons, they will not honor it or they will come up with any excuse to cut it in half. I just purchased tickets for my wife and I for travel in February to Istanbul and I had locked my reservations. My wife had an existing voucher and I was paying by Credit card. They have rules that no one knows and they want you to know about these rules after they issue you the voucher, that if you have a voucher you can only redeem that in a sales office in the USA or Turkey or local country of Origin. Try getting a sales office in the USA. There are none and all USA sales office numbers get routed to the call center that has difficulty understanding English. So if one has to redeem a voucher, you can only do that at a Turkish sales office in Turkey. I called the call center, after 20 call attempts since either they had computer errors, or computer was down or they dropped the call, I got an agent, telling me that if I need to ticket my ticket together with my wife, I have to go to the Sales office in USA and or Turkey not willing to understand there are no Sales offices in the USA that are manned unless you have lost baggage. Finally I found a friend, who went to the Istanbul office to book my tickets that were already locked with a price but they ended up charging me and extra $60 for my tickets of $920 (total $980) and $340 for my wifes tickets that had a voucher of $1000 and the tickets were $920. So her tickets actually cost me $1000 from the originally purchase I had made plus $340 extra. Total $1340. Remember I had already locked a price of $1940 for two tickets from the Turkish website and had a reservation code and Paid for the lock of the tickets. The reason for this hike was the new ticket is being booked in Turkey, and the Turkish lira is 14 to a lira and when I was given the voucher for $1000 of refund that Lira was 8liras so I have to pay the 6liras per $1 price difference for the devaluation of currency hence the extra cost is $340 on the new ticket plus the $1000 on the voucher. Where is the logic in this? What happens if there is no one in Turkey to go to the sales office locally? I guess can never use the Voucher. Where is the logic that If I paid US $1000 on a ticket in June 2021, they cancelled the flight due to COVID, they issued the voucher, now they converted that $1000 to exchange rate at that time and I have to pay out of pocket more money because the $1000 is now worth $500.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Baghdad via Istanbul,October 2021,,,,,,,1,no,True,Miami,Baghdad,Istanbul

Then when arrived my destination, one of my luggage was missing and I needed to wait 2 days to receive it. Since this was not my final destination, I needed to pay for 2 nights of accommodation until receiving my luggage. But the worst part is when I called 2 days before my departure flight for changing my return date. First I asked for a date 12 days from this point and I was told it is going to cost $40 USD. My original ticket costed me almost $700 USD for a return ticket. As I was not sure about the date, I asked if I can have an open return and then I was told you can make your ticket open and I asked if it is going to work like my current ticket and the cost for changing the date will be in similar range and I was told that making your ticket open return is not going to make additional cost compared to now when you want to set a date for your return. So I made it open return. I called 3 days after that and asked for price for changing to a date 16 days from this point and I was told it costs $960 USD. I checked their website and the ticket itself was only $980 USD. I told them you mean my current ticket worth only $20 USD! After making a complain following up for 5 days for my complain through phone, finally, I received a generic answer that according to our fare rules that is what you need to pay. I called this day again and asked again about the price difference, I was told you need to pay $978 USD for a return date change while the price ticket from their website was $932.Unbelievable, it costs more to change return date than buying a new ticket.

422,Nils Grede,Turkey,2022-01-03,1,"This review is about the customer service at Turkish Airlines or the absence of quality customer service. This ticket was bought in the summer of 2021. In August I received a notification that the flight TK1333 from Istanbul to Bremen for 24 December has been canceled. In November I call the airline given it does not fly to Bremen that day to change my flight to Hanover and I rent a rental car to get to Bremen. My partner had the same issue, for him we called a few days before the actual flight to make the changes. Both times the customer service agent tells us the flight is canceled and tells us our options. We go for the free rebooking. On 24 December at the airport, we see at the departure screen that flight TK1333, presumably canceled is operating with 10 minutes delay. It was too late for us to switch. I took a picture of the departure screen. A few days later I email Turkish Airlines customer service highlighting the failure to provide good service, the failure to notify us when the flight got rescheduled or to tell us when we called twice (once for each traveller) that the flight had been rescheduled. This is not my first time dealing with their customer service through the terribly heavy feedback mailing system. The answers are typically unsatisfactory. Generic sentences saying the airline feels sorry (not: apologizes). In the first reply the flight cancellation issue was not addressed at all. The second time the answer was amazing for its uselessness - it showed how little a state-owned and-subsidized airline feels it has to be accountable to its paying customers. Here is what I received: 'We’ve reviewed your feedback forms TK-5751236 and TK-5721899 in our review, we found that the activities and evaluations we carried out following your feedback were in accordance with all rules and procedures. As such, unfortunately we’re unable to take your request any further.' I still do not know what happened, why the error happened, not do I have an apology or any commercial gesture to compensate. I have had a number of such bad experiences with Turkish Airlines customer service - usually it is impossible to get the agent to engage on the topic at hand. Errors are rarely admitted.

Customer Service is horrible. Food is horrible. Usually an air hostess is there to assist you and be at your service. Well not on this airline. You have to get up and walk to them if you need anything. I was pressing the call button and No one coming even after 20 mins of repeatedly pressing the button on and off to catch attention from them.

429,J Marber,United States,2021-12-23,1,"I would never recommend Turkish Airlines for any travel. Their customer care is the worse. I had to change my departure airport and while doing it they failed to change my arrival airport. I called them again to change both departure and arrival airport to IAH, Houston. To change it from JFK to IAH, they asked for a large amount of money ($3700 for route change) which did not make any sense. I decided to cancel my one leg of the flight and get a Qatar Airways flight. When I called them to cancel my return flight, they said it can not be canceled before the first leg of the flight is done. They advised requesting cancellation after the first leg of the flight is done. In that case, you will receive the full amount less the amount used for the first leg, the customer service person said. One thing to note about their customer service is this; they don't have a consistent answer for the same queries each time you call. Different people give different answers. It is a big hassle to talk to their customer service. They will flatly say no to your requests and they don't have a supervisor or a higher authority who can make a decision. They will tell you to email the local sales office. I asked to give the telephone number of the local sales office and her response was this "" Sorry, we don't have a local sales office in the US. You will have to email them. It may take 3 business days before you get a response."" After the first leg of the trip was over, I called customer service to cancel my return flight. They said our system is not updated that your first leg is completed. So give it 24 hours so our system can get updated and you can receive your refund. I called them after 24 hours of the first leg of the flight and the response varied. I called at least 10 times. Each time talked to different customer care personnel. The answer varied from your ticket is non-refundable (their person only said it is a flexible ticket and you can get a full refund after the first leg, and also it says on the ticket that it is refundable), the system not allowing me to process this, call back in 2 hours since our system is stuck. One person said you will receive $541 but when he tried to process it, he said the system is not letting him. Long story short, they managed to take a huge amount of money from me. The total ticket price was $2236. After completion of one leg, as per Turkish Airline customer service, I was supposed to get around ~800-900 US dollars. I have the names of each person I talked to and information received from them. But they kept a chunk of it and refunded only $160. And mind you, this is how they make money! I have never seen poorer customer service anywhere! They don't care about customers as much as they care about money. Never fly Turkish Airlines!

432,J Seldon,Australia,2021-12-17,1,"I can simply describe the whole experience as awful. Worst airline I have flown in 20 years. I am a Platinum Qantas FF and fly 1000s of miles every year. Long haul in business, short haul in economy. Check In - Awful. No Business Class signs, told to just ""push in front"" of a queue of at least 100 people trying to verify documents. Staff ignored requests for help and pretended not hear. Unorganised mess. Rude and aggressive ground staff, which defined the rest of the experience with staff. I was charged over weight of $250 euros. I reweighed what they claimed was 17kg in Manila, it was 10kg. It was a monitor that amazon had delivered ay 9.98kg. Same with my suitcase. If I had an option to walk away and get a refund I would have would have. I flew to Malta on Easyjet and they weighed the same bags and monitors at the weights I had got. I was not the only one being overcharged. MLA to IST - Awful. Lucky I took a few waters from the lounge. Offered a drink, never arrived. Cabin Crew spent whole flight hiding. Again they come across as rude and aggressive. The meal was beef fillet - burnt broccoli and a hamburger (that's what is looked and tasted like). One of the few positives the seats in the new 737 are good. 2 x 2 in business. Lounge Istanbul - Awful. Food was basically cakes. Not enough sitting space. Stocked up on water as expecting another painful leg. IST to MNL - Awful. Maybe I have been spoilt on Qatar A350. Maybe I was already annoyed but what a terrible product. Staff - I had to really bite my lip or I would have been incredibly rude. Just like they are. No menu, no drink offered, just super rude and aggressive staff. Ordering food was a challenge, ordering a drink impossible - would it not have been easier to get the menus, rather than describe the completely wrong products - ""some sort of beef thing"", it was lamb. Ordered a cabernet got a shiraz. Asked for water - nope. The seats -  I thought I was flying BA back 15 years ago. flat beds that go into a point so you can barely get your feet in. Super uncomfortable to sleep on, once offered to make my bed up, never came back. I was too scarred to ask due to the super aggressive rudeness of the staff. Everything was a chore. They huffed and puffed all the way through service. First meal (mezze) was goodish. Second was inedible, and I eat anything. Was never asked everything ok or shown any kind of care at all. I only flew Turkish as it was short lay over. I had flown them before the reverse route, side by side business seats where so much better. in flight chefs were great.

At check-in in the second line I was informed my PCR test from November 30th was not valid- same day testing was now required. Off I went to a rapid test a couple thousand feet way. 45 minutes later returned with another test and was cleared. I was told to hurry for the flight was close to boarding.

It was now about 0110hrs. I was a little confused since we had just went through 2 pretty intense security checks to now see we were going through another one. Security was wand scanning and intensely going through carry on bags etc. Many people were agitated. Shorty after 0200 we began boarding the aircraft. We waited onboard for just over an hour with the pilot apologizing for the delays. Initially he said we'd be 20min late. At about 0315 a passenger became angry over the delay and eventually was removed from the plane. Our flight started taxing at 0400. We did not arrive Miami until about 0900hrs.

We were sent from one desk to another for 7 to 8 hours trying to figure things out. No one provided the correct information. No one helped with the luggage, the accommodation, nothing at all! We had to deal with all this with two small children. In the end, we ended up paying for the accomodation we had to find ourselves and for the new flight.

I spent thousands of Dollars on a ticket (which I showed my passport of nationality) and it was accepted just in the end 2 hours before my flight to be notified by the airline that I can’t enter because they do not except the specific national passport. If that were the case they shouldn’t have accepted the ticket when bought or made it clear that travellers with these certain nationalities/passport may not enter.

However, they couldn't change my old one. I asked them to cancel it - they couldn't do that either. They told me to do at the airport before my flight. When I left my home for the airport, the new ticket with an infant seat was still available. When I got to the airport, their system was down. The sales agent said my only option is to pay $450 for the infant seat because their system was down. He said I can write in after and get a refund. When I did, they refused my refund. All I needed to do was pay a $25 change fee or a $50 cancellation fee and pay 4,500 more miles. Their system was down, so I couldn't.

The ground agent insisted that the 12 and 12kg be separated into one additional bag, which we didn't have with us.

Also, they did not respect the seat reservations we had, since they say that they reserve the right to move people around the plane which ended up with us not sitting together for the final leg of the journey. Not something one would expect from a business class service since whoever has carried a baby through the airport knows what it comes down to running with two kids and a couple of loose items. (a picture of the tagged items attached) Previously I have flown with children on Lufthansa (where three of us had only one hand luggage weighing 11kg) and on Austrian, Aeromexico, LOT and we never had such issues although we always flew economy. Landing at the airport in Istanbul, going through the security there are signs that there is a separate line for families with children, but it doesn't exist and instead there is one line for everyone. The lounge was overcrowded to such an extent that there were long lines for the bathroom.

I have flown with British Airways, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and American Airlines and none of them are as good as Turkish Airlines. I am talking about economy class. They gave you a great cute bag of amenities, it is almost the same as the bags that Ipsy gives (for people who don't know know, Ipsy is a make-up subscription). Inside, there is a toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, lipstick (a good brand), eye patches for sleeping and hand cream. Their economy class bathrooms are just like first-class. They give pillows and blankets. They offer several newspapers in the entrance. The seats are very comfortable. The staff are friendly. The TV and shows are great and there are many movies. The food is plenty and delicious. They give you free food and water anytime you want. They always do this on long-haul flights (I flew recently). Regarding the short-haul flight (its been a while), they used to give food and amenities as well. I don't know whether it changed. British Airways sell food on short haul and they don't give amenity kits to short-haul passengers at all (I don't know about long-haul). I think the people who wrote bad comments about Turkish Airlines mostly flew with Business or First Class as there is not much difference between economy and these classes compared to other airways.

The only issue that I had was that their website always had many bugs on it and occasionally I would need to resubmit the information several times before it actually works. But that didn't affect the flight experience. But this all changed recently. The airline has refused to give me the specific seats that I have paid for in advance. Not only that, but they have also refused to issue a refund on those seat purchases. Essentially, their customer services are no better than a low-coster. I bought tickets for Male - Istanbul flight and paid extra for specific seats (24J and 24K) to make sure I sit next to my girlfriend on that flight. And I specifically chose the seats with extra leg room, which are the most expensive seats in Economy class. However, despite the fact that I have paid in advance for the specific seats on that flight, we have been denied access to the seat 24K. That seat was allocated to someone else. Essentially, I have been denied the specific service I have paid for. Because we wanted to sit together, neither me nor my girlfriend got the seats we paid for. Instead, once the boarding has been completed, we have been moved to inferior seats in the middle of the cabin, as those were the only ones available. I have made three attempts to contact the company and get a refund. First time, they said they didn't wan to hear about my complain, because I need to do it through the online form and not by sending an email to them. Second time, they refused to deal with it, claiming that I haven't put some specific reference number in the text that wasn't even mentioned in the instruction. That was despite the fact that I have put enough information to make me easily identifiable as a passenger. Third time, when I have included every reference number I could find, I have received a refusal to issue a refund. It took me a while to understand what the reply actually said, as it used really awful English grammar, but they claimed that those substandard seats were equivalent to the ones I purchased. But they were not, as isle middle isle seats and window seats are very different and had different amount of leg room. Also, the customer representative has claimed that, even with the change, me and my girlfriend were still issued seats together. I don't know if they realise it, but having an isle between our seats is definitely NOT classed as seating together! I will still consider all the options for getting the refund. I've paid over £125 for those seats that I was refused to be given, so I will consider making a complaint to relevant authorities or even contacting my bank for a chargeback. And I will not tolerate such a behaviour from an airline that doesn't present itself as a low-cost.

However, apparently the company is guilty of overbooking, of which my son and I became a victim, and, as a result, our 15-hour flight lasted for three days. In Istanbul, the airline gave us an obscure background check on the reasons for entering Canada for my son, who has a valid student visa and study permit. Still in an atmosphere of terrible nervousness, because the check was carried out in the last minutes before going on the plane. In the end, we were allowed to board the plane, but by that time the exit was already closed, the landing was over, and the plane flew to Vancouver without us. There were about 10 people like us on this flight, some returned to Kiev, and some, like us, agreed to fly to Vancouver on the next flight every other day. The fact that all this was not accidental, namely with the aim of weeding out excess passengers, is evidenced by the fact that our luggage did not fly to Vancouver, but somehow also remained in Istanbul. And upon arrival in Canada, it turned out that the question that interested Turkish Airline so much was not at all relevant for the Canadian border guards, since they did not contain any comments regarding the grounds for entering the country. Since we had to wait two days in Istanbul for the next flight, there was a question about the hotel. The airline refused to put us in a hotel. Therefore, we had to pay for accommodation and food in Istanbul out of our own pocket. Although, the legislation in such cases stipulates that the airline must provide such passengers with accommodation and three meals a day and even communication. However, any attempts to prove something were threatened to deprive us of even those tickets for the next flight that we were promised. To top it all off, upon claiming luggage in Vancouver, it turned out that three of our four suitcases were destroyed, broken, torn apart, that is, beyond repair. The day after the flight, I filed a complaint about the suitcases on the airline's website, as well as a complaint demanding to reimburse the cost of the hotel and food in Istanbul, as well as to pay compensation prescribed by law.

During the flight we had to emergency land and the crew would not inform us of what happened. We were already 3-4 hours into the flight and they wanted to fly us back to LAX even though we were over Chicago. Later they told us the window by the pilots had a crack in it, so for safety we were going to emergency land and apparently this is a common issue with their planes. After everyone on the plane was asking to land in Chicago because we were flying over it, they instead landed and stranded us in JFK airport in New York. The crew was going to inform us what to do as the plane landed but never did. 300 people were stuck at JFK and we all had to go to one small terminal in an enclosed space and retrieve all our luggage. This happened around 5AM. It took almost 3 hours to get my family's luggage. Then we had to wait outside for another 3-4 hours to wait for small shuttles that can only fit about one family to take us to a hotel. We ended up booking at a nearby hotel and took an Uber, otherwise we would have to wait even longer in the cold.

We lost an entire day due to Turkish Airlines' negligence. They're extremely rude and don't communicate. Also, I had paid extra to have seats with more legroom. Once we got on the flight our seats weren't where they were supposed to be. We realized they changed the plane without informing us. I talked to a crew member and compared emails of our flight to show this was the case and they confirmed it. So, we lost more money there too. Just now I was trying to delay my return flight (back to LAX) for another week. I called Expedia and they could not help because of Turkish Airlines restrictions and told me to call them. So, I called Turkish Airlines 800 number and the man on the phone was very rude and dismissed any questions I had. He said I had to contact the JFK office to change my flight because when we were stuck in New York, we booked a new ticket (not sure how that’s connected). Even though Turkish Airlines messed up my flight, I had to contact JFK. So he gave me an email address and told me to email them for help. I did and asked to delay my flight.

Missed local transportation options twice in that time period (every 1.5 hours) and had to sit at Chicago for an additional hour and a half.

The day before we were in Embassy of Greece to get my consent for my husband to travel with kids. No issues.

I was headed from LA to Montenegro via Istanbul. Once I landed in Istanbul, I saw my flight was cancelled to Montenegro. No email or phone notification - just on the boards upon arrival. They told me the next one would be the following morning - and when I asked why they said they don't know. But since it's COVID, so many people on my flight were going to have our tests expire if we had such a long layover - as most countries don't allow international layovers longer than 8 hours. So I had to pay for a sketchy VISA at the airport, go through customs, go get another COVID and wait for the results in the middle of the night. I got my results, went back to the terminal, waited another few hours and - guess what - they cancelled the rescheduled flight a couple hours before takeoff. Now my fellow passengers were furious, because they were giving no reason for the cancelled flights and just said they can cover our hotels. I asked when the next flight would be, and they said they don't know but probably tomorrow (turns out it was about 36 hours later - keep in mind most countries don't accept COVID tests older than 72 hours especially if you've had a layover). I then asked if there's any guarantee that the flight won't be cancelled a third time, and they said they don't know. So I got to the airport on friday, it was now nearing sunday, and I started work monday. I told them I might just have to drive, but to get me as close to Montenegro as possible. They put me on a cheap flight to Serbia, which was delayed by a couple of hours (one hour of which the passengers were sitting on a crowded bus outside of the terminal as they de-iced the plane). On top of this, passengers on both my LA-IST flight, and IST-Belgrade flight weren't wearing masks, and it didn't seem to bother the flight attendants. So I got to Serbia, had to get a hotel on my own dime, and another flight to Montenegro on my own dime. I'm of course going to dispute the original ticket cost since they screwed me over and just sent me to an airport that seems to profit off of cancelled flights by not offering complimentary internet (you have to pay a substantial fee every 12 hours), by forcing you to buy a visa in cash if you now need a new covid tests, and by offering pricy covid tests.

In the end it was impossible to change the reservation without filing a complaint (which they call “feedback”). And this feedback requires waiting to receive a feedback #, which one must use to communicate again with the Romanian client services. This was done, and I was told to expect an email in 2 hours — which never arrived. Back to the Romanian call center, another 2 hours wasted trying to explain, to no avail.

On my way to my gate I have noticed my flight status ( last call) I run around 3 minutes but unfortunately I missed my flight. I went direct to the customer service informing them the situation and this was at 12.50am which’s 5 minutes after the gate close and 55 minutes before the flight time, customer service lady asked me on very rough and taff way to follow the line tried to inform her I have a baby and we can catch the flight but she ignored me. Now, I understood no way and I have missed the flight. I started to ask about solutions ( the only option to provide me another flight after 15 hours without hotel accommodation and Egyptian Nationalists not allow to enter the country by getting visa upon arrival.

For the return trip Paris-IST-KL (20th Feb 2021), Turkish Airlines suddenly sent a cancellation notice in Nov 2020. We then decided to stay back due to Covid and contacted Turkish Airlines on 9th Jan 2021, with intention to postpone our flight. When we got a reply back from Turkish Airlines, they had by then re-scheduled the flight instead of having cancelled earlier. Anyhow, we still wrote in to postpone the flight. We provided the Booking Ref., which should already be sufficient for them to take action. Then we received another reply demanding that we provide, Booking Ref, Names, Original Flight No, Flight Date, Flight Time, E-Ticket No, which we furnished. That was on 11th Jan 2021.

619,Barbar Kuofie,United States,2020-12-27,3,"Lets just say, this was my first and last experience with them. I bought my ticket way before the pandemic and decided to fly anyways since there were precautions now to my destination for Covid testing. It all started with them moving my flight from a 4hr layover in turkey to a 38hr layover. I decided, why not, I'll just tour around Turkey during that time - this is after I'm assured by the ticket agent I talked with that the airline will give me a hotel once I land. When I arrived at checkin, the guy checking me in couldn't find my ticket so I had to dig into my email for all the information about the ticket. He then proceeds to enter a wrong information and attached it to my baggage. Since it would take him some effort to fix this error, he decided I must suffer the consequence and pick up all 3 of my big luggages and carry it around in Turkey and check them in again for my next flight. At this point, I'm getting a sense of what flying with these people entails. In the plain, a brown paperbag of some cate, a cold sandwich and juice is tossed at us as a meal. Once I landed, I find out other passengers had flights to the destination I wanted to go and only mine and a few other people were moved to two days later - trying to change my ticket was double what I originally paid for by the way. Strange. Mind you, I need a covid test 48hrs before I enter Ghana, and the one I have with me will expire. This means I'll need another test in Istanbul before I'm allowed to board my flight. Next comes getting a visa at the Istanbul airport - (Cheap is not looking too cheap now). After learning all this, I decided to go with the flow, since there was nothing else to do. I go to their service desk for the hotel promised and I was told my flight doesn't qualify for a free hotel because I agreed to them changing my ticket. Mind you, I had no other option. Cancelling my ticket meant losing some amount. At this point I'm fuming. I just lugged my luggage out of the airport and paid for my own hotel. Coming back from Ghana is a whole other story.

621,Casey Hendley,United States,2020-12-26,2,"First and last experience with Turkish Airlines. The problems began at check-in, when they refused to check my bag through from AMS over to KLM (I flew Delta from AMS to ATL and then home to TPA). ""No problem,"" I thought, ""I will just go through passport control, grab my bag, and check in with KLM again.""  I chose my own seat, which was great. I prefer a window seat toward the front of the cabin. So everything was going to be great in 9A, flying on Christmas Day to Amsterdam, so it should be quiet and fairly decent for an Economy flight. Upon boarding, the gate agent took my boarding pass and reassigned me to 38A, the literal last row of seating on the plane. I am fuming at this point, as the front of Economy cabin is literally empty. Turkish passengers began complaining so much (this had also happened to them) that the gate agent came onto the plane and said she had to move us to the back to ""balance the plane"" .. this is the actual explanation that we got. Utterly absurd. Everyone who tried to move to a different seat during the flight was forced to return to their assigned seat, even though the plane was almost empty, and several people were forced to go back and sit with people with whom they were not traveling! Unreal! The cleanliness and hygiene was fine. We got a brown paper bag with a kashar cheese sandwich, a cake, a box of fruit juice, and a small bottle of water. Leg room was appalling, but not out of line with most Economy seats. But the fun had only just begun! Upon arrival in Amsterdam, I went to passport control so I could go to the baggage claim, collect my checked bag, and check-in with Delta (via KLM) .. except at passport control, I was told that I was not allowed to enter the EU because of COVID restrictions! So, I walked up to the transfer section, went through the security check, and then tried to find my gate and someone to help me. Because of THY's refusal to check my bag through to another airline, it was removed from the plane, slung onto the belt, and dumped. Without KLM's help, they would have abandoned my checked bag in AMS with no way for me to reclaim it! Thankfully, a KLM agent was extremely helpful, called Swissport with my THY bag claim ticket number, and got it loaded onto my Delta flight.

623,E Kerfen,United States,2020-12-19,3,"I am Turkish and used THY services more than 10 times in the last 4 years. I believe you should be looking for another airline company if you are not obliged to use their services due to the following reasons: For international flights: THY is, as far as I concern only airline which has a direct flight from Los Angeles - LAX to Istanbul - IST airport. That was the main reason I have decided to use their services again, and I regret my decision not surprisingly. There are two different scenarios: Imagine, you are arranging a flight from LAX to IST, which has a domestic transfer from IST to Izmir Adnan Menderes - ADB airport. They leave only 55 minutes between 2 flights, where you should get into passport check and airport security. As if this wasn't enough, your LAX flight gets delayed 35 mins, and they only postpone your flight for only 5-10 minutes. The cream of the pie was, they assign the domestic transfer gate to the furthest possible one. When you arrive at the gate after having a small running competition and just as you are seeing that they are shutting the gate down, you are being told that it is too late now instead of not shutting down the gate. Then you are going to the ticket office, and they are saying that the next flight is like, 6 hours later. After you have been flown like 13+ hours, you are going to wait 6 more hours. Thanks, that is classy. I will need to buy food, internet and sit here for 6 hours. I have just come here to see my family after three years, and I have only a week here. So, your free ticket doesn't solve the issues, does it? Oh, the second one is even better. The very similar scenario above, but you are flying to Beograde - Tesla Airport (if I remember the name correctly) instead of having a domestic flight. Delays only 15 mins, but you had 45 mins between 2 flights.  For domestic flights: Well, this is a short one. You are arriving at the airport 70 mins before the flight and arriving at the counter 57-58 mins before the flight. You will walk only 5 mins to reach the gate after the counter. But they are telling you ""sir, you should've been here 60 mins before"". So, you buy another ticket from another airline. General: Food was a disaster.  Not only because of pandemic considerations but also managed poorly, and their attitude confirms their current position.  As common sense, If it takes 25 mins to walk to the transfer gate and if there are both passport and security check, then you don't assign 1 hour between flights. Easy.

My many contacts with their support system finally wore me down at the end. All four sectors of my flight has been cancelled one by one over the last few months, which I can accept due to the Covid situation. Problem is that every cancellation forced me into the arms of the call center. I have learned a few things from these interactions. Be prepared to press a lot of numbers on the phone before talking to a human. Very few of the agents seems able to make a decision without talking to a supervisor while you are waiting. If the answer you finally get from an agent seems strange/weird/stupid don’t give up. Call back, talk to another agent and ask the same question. In my experience there is a good chance you will get a different answer. There seem to be an arcane way of doing things in this company. At one point I had to pay a fee for a date change on one of my flights, but none of the agents were able to tell me how much the fee would be. I got guesses ranging all the way from 50 to 400 euros. “Someone for another department will call you, calculate the fee and arrange the payment”, I was told. So I waited for a day, two days and finally after five days, I called back asking about the fee. Again I was told “Somebody from another department will call you, calculate the fee and arrange payment”, I was told again. “When do you thing it will happen”, I asked. “Maybe one more week. I don’t know. But if you not hear anything, you should call back”, said the agent. So after another week I gave up.  And since I couldn’t cancel the ticket online, I had my last encounter with the call center. Here is a play by play: Me: Hello I want to cancel my ticket. Agent 1: I can’t do that for you. I will transfer you. Me: Hello I want to cancel my ticket. Agent 2: I can’t do that. You have to go to one of our offices. Me: The one nearest to my home (90 min away) have been closed due to Covid. The one in Copenhagen (4 hours away) is listed as “temporarily closed” on your homepage. Agent 2 (after a long pause): You can send them an email. Me: I did that 3 days ago. I haven’t received a reply. Agent 2: You can send them another one. Me: Listen, I just want to cancel the ticket. Agent 2.: Okay I will cancel it for you.

The next day Turkish Airlines canceled the flight and told me there were no flights from Atlanta (how is that possible when I purchased a ticket from their own website just a day before?) and that a refund will take about 8 months. Turkish Airlines customer support is trained to look incompetent and either pretend or they do speak poor English. They were useless every time I called them. So I contacted the Credit Card company and told them about the fraudulent business practice and they initiated an investigation. To make the story short Turkish Airlines fought back with all sorts of lies and delayed the refund until the Credit company passed some internal deadlines for processing. So, about 5 months after the initial purchase, the credit company provided me with a full refund but at their expense and they confirmed that the Turkish Airline got away with it.

Our travel agent called Turkish Airlines and confirmed multiple times that, given the current circumstances and delays in passport renewals, we would have no issue boarding our flight from IAH. The day of our flight, the check-in counter made it impossible for us to board. The first agent refused to check us in and referred us to a supervisor, who also refused and kept repeating that the passport was not valid for check-in. They told us ""you will not be able to board the flight"" and even tried to refer us to a sales agent to reschedule our flight. We asked to speak to the station manager and were referred to staff who gave us the worst treatment I have ever seen from an airline employee. I asked her to contact Turkish Airlines at Cairo Airport and confirm that the passport issue would not be a concern (as we were told), she refused. My travel agent directly contacted airline staff in Egypt and had them call me on my cellphone. They asked to speak with the staff, who refused to take my phone and walked out on me twice while I was speaking to her. The staff kept demanding that Cairo staff email them a written authorization to board. Meanwhile, Cairo staff was telling us that the inquiry would have to come from the point of departure, and that they were ready to authorize it as soon as IAH staff reaches out to them. I repeated this several times; they refused to help and told me ""I'm not going to let anyone tell me how to do my job."" At this point check-in was about to close in 15 minutes, and no one was willing or even trying to help us resolve our issue by simply doing their job and reaching out to their colleagues in Cairo. Finally, Cairo staff sent two authorization emails to the IAH desk, at which point they checked us in (but delayed us even further due to more miscommunication between airline staff). The staff never came back to apologize or check us in herself, she had her staff help us instead and did not speak to us again throughout the process. Staff in Egypt were all very helpful at the end, but it was already too late.

Due to COVID they have rescheduled the flights a couple of times. After 4 times of cancellations I finally had a confirmed flight back to Jakarta. At the airport in Amsterdam it was complete chaos. Turkish Airlines was greatly understaffed and most people had to wait for more than 1.5 hours in line before able to check in. When it was finally my turn the ground staff did not recognize my resident visa. Even after providing all the necessary information and talking to the supervisor on the phone the ground staff decided not to let me check in. Again, all documents were in order, the ground staff were just not aware of this type of visa. I asked for a reschedule so I could discuss this with Turkish Airlines customer service. In the days after this I spent hours on the phone with the customer service of Turkish Airlines to inform them about all the VALID documentation I had to be on that flight. After a week or so, I decided to buy another ticket from a different airline, KLM. With exactly the same visa and other documentation I was able to take the flight back. After coming back I reached out to Turkish Airlines many, many times, but they have basically ignored all my arguments and documentation. They have just decided not to solve this issue at all.

The crew are not allowed to let the pax change their seats because: “in case you got sick after this flight, they should know what was your seat” instead of just taking an actions on preventing their pax from getting sick by following social distance rules and common sense. The lady sitting next to me was obviously sick, sneezing and coughing all the time, moreover she was enormously overweight, so it was very inconvenient and not safe to sit there. Despite all this, I wasn’t allowed to change my seat while 5-6 rows at the back were empty. Which is totally unacceptable for the covid situation.

The only positives I will say are flight attendants and mostly on time experience. The rest was as bad as a discount airline. I flew 6 flights, roundtrip LAX to IST, IST to ASY, ASY to ADB (via IST), ADB to IST. Turkish is supposed to have great food service. Well, a 13 hour flight and we got two boxed lunches with cafeteria quality food. Limited beverages. No snacks. That was both ways on the long-haul. Tell me how covid doesn't live on a cold box, but it would on a warm wrapped sandwich? How does it not live on a box, but apparently a bag of chips or crackers or candy? When asked you could tell the flight attendants were embarrassed. On the short flights in Turkey in Business, you got a 4 oz cup of water. Apparently Covid doesn't live on water container, but does on soda or juice? Add to this that they brag about access to business lounge. Domestic and Intl closed at IST, so they pack you into regular club. No social distancing and Domestic lounge only had prepacked rolls and a cheese sandwich. Intl had hot food, but the lines were 15 to 20 persons deep. In Izmir, no lounge due to COVID, even though other Lounges open. In Kayseri, no lounge open and you had to carry your bags from check-in to a luggage belt with no assistance. And they don't allow any carry on bigger than backpack or shopping bag, even in Business on 13 hour flight. In LAX, they didn't open check-in until 2.5 hours before departure, even though the staff said 3 hours. And they were flying 787 from LAX but switched to old 777 with 2/3/2 configuration where either you get crawled over or you crawl over someone. And the seats are designed for multi directional recline, but they don't work. Wifi wouldn't connect on laptop, iPhone or Android. 3 flight attendants tried to help, but couldn't get it to work. Turkish sent an email apologizing and offered 25% discount on next flight if booked in 30 days/travel in 60. That's really helpful to someone living in the US! To blame COVID safety precautions for what is merely an attempt to save money is shameful, especially when they cram people together at check-in and in lounges.

Turkish Airlines was one of the very few companies still allowing people around the world to look and book for flights, they would apply full charge to the credit card for flights which they knew would never be allowed to take off. Few days before departure they would claim COVID state restrictions to cancel the flight and offer all kind of compensations except of returning the stolen cash. I have tried to apply for standard refund (money back) from MAY to SEPTEMBER and initially they were asking to wait 2 months after flight restrictions have been lifted and after it happened they now answer they won t take any request of refund which is filed later than August 16th.

658,T Maraleva,Turkey,2020-09-01,1,"Turkish Airlines (THY) used to have one of the best business class on short haul flights within Europe. Not anymore. At first, it might seem that certain elements of the older days' business class are unavailable due to some sanitary measures against the coronavirus. At least, this is what Turkish Airlines will try to make you believe in. Yet, on a closer look, you just realize that they are cost-cutting on whatever they can, even if their business class tickets cost as much as they did when it was good. What I find offensive as a customer is that deception of its customers is part of the economic model here.  They no longer serve you a proper warm meal in the business class and try to say that it is due to some anti-virus measures. But Lufthansa and many other airlines still do that with an additional measure of a transparent plastic cover on the top of your dining tray. If those airlines can, why cannot THY? The cold meal box that they provide (as an allegedly ""safer"" option) is so cheap that it just ""screams"" from within ""we are cost-cutting!"". For example, if hummus can be put there into that small covered round plastic bowl, why cannot they serve a proper dessert like say a chocolate mousse? And how is it more ""dangerous"" to serve a decent dessert in the same container in which they serve you their hummus anyway? Instead you get a Snickers bar as your dessert! Yes, a junk food in the business class! No more Champagne or French wines. Again, the board attendants will tell you this is because of the virus. Yet, the small bottles of a cheaper Turkish wines by Kavaklidere are still available (not for long may be). When you ask how is Kavaklidere wine brand ""safer"" than Louis Eschenauer wines or Piper-Heidsieck champagne that they used have you should not, of course, expect any satisfactory answer. Overall, both food and drink experience on board is just an impoverished version of what it used to be. They did not even have a Turkish ayran. The same is with the business lounge at the Istanbul airport. And given the examples I made, it is clear that these drastic downgrading in quality is far from being owned exclusively to precautions again the virus. Again, it is fine if an airline chooses a cost-cutting business model. But what is not fine is that they still sell you their ""business class"" for an old price which is nowadays a premium economy at best. So in the end, as a customer I feel tricked and deceived and realize that it is at the expense of customers like me that THY is trying to compensate for their losses by selling me the business class for an old price and then cost-cutting on my travel experience so that there is a larger net income from their new, downgraded ""business class"" ticket sales. And what is worse, is that they don't even seem to be interested in their customers opinion any more. There is no feedback for at their website! Clearly, purchasing Turkish Airlines business class ticket is never again. Sadly, I already have one more flight segment purchased.

662,N Marsun,United Kingdom,2020-08-26,1,"Never in my worst nightmares did I think I’d have an experience as horrifying as this one. This was my first time traveling with Turkish Airlines and after the experience I’ve had I pray it was my last as well. I was travelling with my family of four (me, my husband, and my 2 kids). We couldn’t preselect the seats since the airline didn’t enable the online check-in which I’m assuming was to a measure taken to ensure social distancing on the flight. They placed us all separately, when I asked why they said it was because of the social distancing measures that we were placed rows apart next to strangers. Me and my husband were placed towards the front while my kids were seated right next to each other at the very back of the flight. My husband was placed one seat apart from whoever was next to him, however I was placed right next to some strangers with an empty seat next to the three of us - my kids were placed directly next to a stranger who turned out to be the mother of one who was also placed away from her kid. Soon we found out that most families were separated this way, which to me is pretty pointless.  I think if they were going to place people right next to each other they very well could’ve placed families AKA people of the same household next to each other instead. A few families were complaining about this prior to take off to which the crew responded very disrespectfully, (they went as far as name calling the passengers out loud) they kept on repeating this was ITA law, and they had to abide by it. They even called ground staff for one of the families. Thankfully the ground staff was way more reasonable and polite then the crew members. They shuffled a few people around including my kids very respectfully and without causing any more chaos. After the ground staff left one of the crew members returned to the family they primarily called the ground staff for and demanded they thank her because she “solved their problem” and proceeded to call the father an idiot once again. After witnessing all this my kids were terrified to move in fear of the crew disrespecting us in the same manner, despite the ground staff’s clearance. They were scared. Then came the flight from Istanbul to Manchester. This flight was fully booked there wasn’t a single seat that was empty. The cherry on top of this cake from hell was the food. Due to Covid-19 to reduce contact with staff they only served us once on both the 8hr and the 4hr flight with the same exact food. There were four items, a bottle of water, a juice box, a dry piece of cake, and a small size cheese and tomato baguette. The baguette was very dry as was the cake.

670,V Momtchil ,Canada,2020-07-30,1,"The coronavirus-related compensation programmes announced by Turkish Airlines are there just to fob clients with empty promises. They refuse to apply them and do not follow ticket change/refund terms as advertised on their website. I had a flight booked with Turkish Airlines from Montreal to Sofia in second half of March 2020. I could not travel due to rapidly evolving pandemic situation, with new travel advisories and restriction imposed, and borders closed literally every 24 hours. At that time, Turkish Airlines had already cancelled virtually all European flights as of March 14 and had announced seemingly customer friendly compensation policies such as the Open Ticket and the Zero Change Fee. Back then, I called Turkish Airlines customer center, explained precisely my case, provided airline confirmation number and they told me my ticket was cancelled and I was eligible for free ticket change under their Zero Change Fee policy. Whenever I’d decide my new dates of travel, I should simply call them back for issuing my new ticket – that’s what they told me and this fact is well documented. Beginning of July I contacted them to request ticket change for a flight in August for the same destination and same cabin class as per the Zero Change Fee policy terms. It’s been 3 weeks now and I still do not have my new ticket issued. During that time I spend a lot of time calling Turkish Airlines call center, speaking to customer care department, writing several feedbacks through the form on their website. They would not take responsibility, I was given a bunch of ridiculous explanations and excuses, even got shameful demands to collect fare difference or cabin class ‘upgrade’ for more money, all of which contradicts the published terms of their Zero Change Fee policy. So, bottom line is that they do not adhere to the terms of announced policies, waste customers time and deride customers by asking them to contact third parties or their sales offices that may be closed, despite their website states clearly that all requests can be completed by calling the call center or online, as I was told back in March. Their call center and feedback form is a complete waste of time, they are not there to solve problems, but just to lead customers to a dead end – replies are but general wording and one can clearly see nobody in their customer care department is really following your case, aware of details or even reading what you wrote to them. Everything is done to deceive customers and to procrastinate the fulfilment of customer’s requests, ultimately ruining their travel plans.

Finally I got on the flight all the way to Dar es Salaam without any problem in the class that I listed for. On the return leg when I reached Istanbul and went to the transfer desk, I was told to go through security and go to the transfer desk on the other side (what is even more pathetic that Turkish Airlines staff level of English is appalling or they just have no interest in learning/speaking it). I went to the transfer desk by my gate and was given a confirmed seat in business class. When the time came for boarding, I was told to sit aside because business class was ""full"" and I said to the gate agent, ""why did you give me a boarding pass for a confirmed seat?"" and he got annoyed at me then I said ""since you want to downgrade me, I am demanding my money back"" to which his reply was ""you contact Turkish Airlines for that"" and throughout the entire period he continued to be rude and condescending even though he knew I was a crew member. At one point he even threatened to close the gate if I didn't decide what I wanted to do. Long story short, I got thrown out of business class into economy and got treated like dirt. Having a codeshare/Zed ticket doesn't give any gate agent or rep to be rude or condescending because I am still a customer at the end of the day. Turkish Airlines needs to change their behavior and lose their arrogance. First off they need to learn how to speak English proficiently in today's travel industry. The last thing any customer wants is to struggle to understand someone behind a desk who doesn't speak English.

I had to make a slight change in the departure from Baku-IST by a few hours earlier. Because of this change on the initial segment of my flight, all seat selections for the entire itinerary were cancelled, a loss of over 200 euros. I chose to repurchase the seat selection again for a cost of 200 euro. After 2 formal requests to be refunded for the loss of 200 euros in cancelled seat selections, TK simply keeps referring me to the feedback form online and reminds me that I agreed to the changes before I confirmed that change in departure date. Had the vague message at the time of ticket change been made clear, something like ""your seat selections for ALL seats on this entire itinerary will be lost"" I would have never changed the departure date. However, the corporate response from TK continues to refer me to this feedback form which keeps sending me the same unsatisfactory response. TK prides itself on flying to more countries than any other, but who cares. The focus should be on improving the customer experience when dealing with people. TK staff have no decision making power and zero ability to change anything, even after talking to the ""highest level"" of customer service.

But when we were going back to USA (San Francisco) from Lahore, on our 14 hours flight from Istanbul to San Francisco, they separated our whole family. One of my 6 years old was assigned a seat 29J, I was assigned 28J, my 4 years old was assigned 23D, and my wife had 8D although my ticket was showing us sitting adjacent but they changed while issuing us boarding pass. So, it was very difficult for our kids to travel without any grown up. They also have lots of needs which can't be fulfill without an adult's supervision. We requested neighboring passengers to allow us to sit together but we found very non-cooperative neighbors. We requested airlines staff and they called their supervisors. The supervisors arranged two adjacent seats by requesting one of the neighbor and asked us to travel two kids on one seat for 14 hours (how silly). They left after doing this however our kids were not comfortable sitting like this. We again called the supervisors and they started harassing our kids that they will leave them at the airport or leave their parents at the airport if they will not stop crying and travel as the supervisors are thinking. They also threatened us to off board us, then we harshly told them that what you did (requesting the neighbors), we ourselves can do that and we don't need you. The reason we are requesting you guys is that we are parents concerned about our kids (food, sleep, safety, restroom needs etc.) which we cannot cater if we are sitting far from them.

I had been irritated by the shortened connecting time at IST. It should have been 2 hours and a half. Staying comfortably at TK’s CPI lounge, one of my favorite, was gone. Still, I had been worried that I could catch my homecoming flight. No explanation why the flight to Baku was delayed, was heard on board as well as at the boarding gate in Baku Airport. We arrived at IST at 0:55 on DEC 31, 1hour 35min behind the scheduled arrival time. Although no guide for transferring was stationed, I passed through a checkpoint smoothly, as all Business Class passengers were taken quickly near there in a van. I got to the gate just after boarding. The departure time of TK52 was 1:55, so it was well before it. As I took a seat and was drinking a glass of water, the pilot announced a couple of times that he was waiting for connecting passengers to come. After 50-minute delay TK52 commenced taxing. Their in-flight services were far from customer-centered. Taittinger’s champagne is on their wine list. I asked a male FA called a flight chef whether it was well chilled or not. I added, “Taittinger should be served well chilled.” He replied “It is in the fridge, so no problem, sir” I believed him and ordered.  It was not chilled and was flat as well. That bottle must have been opened some hours ago. He would not show up before me from then on.  I asked a female FA for a glass of sparkling water. She asked me, “With ice and lemon?” I said, “Please.” Another FA got me a glass of sparkling water without ice and lemon. What an incoherent service they offered! On their menu almost no other option than a Turkish one, as far as I am concerned I have never found it delicious whenever I visit Turkey. European carriers offer some kinds of Japanese food in their flights bound for Japan. Why not TK? Two hours prior to landing, around 6 pm (Japan Standard Time), at the time of the other meal service called breakfast according to their menu, I asked a female FA for a glass of red Bordeaux. She replied surprisingly, “This is breakfast.” I said back to her without pause, “For some people it is breakfast, but for Japanese people now is the time for dinner.” She brought me one.

774,Azmi Hj Mohamad,Brunei,2019-12-20,1,"I'm writing this review in my room in Yotel Air (hotel) inside Istanbul airport after having been denied my right to board a flight to Berlin with Turkish Airlines by a member of their staff earlier today (12:30 PM, December 19, 2019). I had to book a room in this hotel for an overnight stay and buy a new ticket for the earliest flight to Berlin tomorrow (December 20, 2019) without any compensation from Turkish Airlines. All this was due to the fact that said staff had no knowledge of Schengen visa regulations involving non-EU nationals/passports. I am devastated by this mistreatment by Turkish Airlines. I was supposed to fly with Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Berlin at 12:30 PM earlier today (December 19, 2019), but I was denied boarding by a ground staff member who was in charge of checking passengers' passports and boarding passes at the gate because he assumed that I did not have a VISA/permit to enter Germany. I explained very clearly in simple English that I did not require a VISA to enter Germany and the Schengen Area for tourism purposes for up to 90 days, as my country is included in one of the non-EU countries to which the VISA requirement does not apply (for tourism purposes). He dismissed my claim (which I understand, given the priority for security) and went on to make calls and texts to verify my claim. In the meantime, he made me wait on the side while he attended to all the other passengers who were entering the gate. Because there was no conclusive answer from the other side of the phone, he and his team decided to let the plane leave without me. Not long after the plane had left, he finally got a confirmation from ""Germany border controls"" that my claim that I did not need a VISA for visiting Germany was correct. Then, he took me to a Turkish Airlines booth (airside) to get me rebooked on another flight. After exchanging a few sentences with the Turkish Airlines ticketing team, he left there unattended. He did not say sorry to me. After waiting for four hours for a confirmation from the ticketing team about my next flight, they said to me that I would need to buy a new ticket because my original ticket was a ""promotional"" ticket. I defended myself saying that I did not miss my flight. Rather, I was denied boarding because one of their ground staff members assumed that I needed a VISA permit and did not have one. I rang Turkish Airlines's Customer Service to get help and explained the whole situation via phone and then email. After two hours, they responded to my email say they could not compensate me and even defended said staff for denying me my right to board the plane in the interest of protecting all Turkish Airlines's customers and passengers (was I not a customer?). What broke my heart was the Turkish Airlines team being adamant that it was somehow my mistake - they mentioned ""incomplete documents"", ""invalid visa"" etc. But I never needed a VISA in the first place. Finally, I had no choice but to buy another ticket for a flight the next morning and book a room at the hotel inside the airport. All this without so much as ""sorry"", let alone compensation. I'm now very apprehensive about going to Europe via Istanbul. I've been traveling to Europe since I was 18. I have never been denied boarding until now.

As we were heading towards security, I realized that we weren't issued the ""cabin bag tags"", as I recalled we had those when we were on a TK flight from Kuala Lumpur the week before. Then I asked the ticketing counter for a tag for my cabin bag, and the Turkish Airlines staff gladly gave it to me. Then 2 minutes later, another staff chased us halfway across the airport and told me, rather rudely, ""you can't take those!"". Their own staff gave it to me, why is she telling me like I just took it from behind the counter myself? Then she went on about everybody needs to have their cabin bags checked immediately. Then I asked her ""why weren't they checked before when we were checking in and issued the tags?"", She said in an accusing tone ""because you were hiding your bags"". There were 25 of us in the group, how could their ground staff, there were three of them, not notice any of our cabin bags when we were checking in? This single experience soured our holiday. We were corraled back to the check-in counter to have our bags weighed, we were treated like petty thieves. None of our bags exceeded 5kgs, in the end. The funny thing is, the group after us, none of their cabin bags were issued the cabin bag tags or even required to have their cabin bags weighed!

Unfortunately, the airline cancelled the first leg of the trip two weeks before scheduled departure. This meant I would miss my connection to my ultimate destination. I had to leave two days earlier than planned due to the cancellation. It also meant the exit row seat I paid for was no longer available. Normal businesses would refund this extra expense I paid for the exit row seating. After submitting a feedback request, the airline agreed to refund the money, however, six months later I still have not seen a dime of that money despite tens of feedback requests/emails. The airline has delayed, confused, made excuses, claimed no refund was needed, etc. all to try and frustrate me so that I would no longer pursue the refund. I also contacted the consumer protection division of the USDOT, who relayed my complaint to the airline. The airline again agreed to refund the money, but now continues to make unreasonable demands for me to receive the refund. The airline claims they can not refund the credit card used to make the purchase and insist on me providing a copy of my passport and bank account information. Coincidentally, I had a very similar experience on KLM about a month after my Turkish Airline flight. KLM was wonderful. They refunded my credit card within 5 days of the flight. The Turkish Airline flight was a terrible ten-hour flight that was very uncomfortable. I am tall at 6'2, the seat was not fit for a much smaller person. The aircraft was old. The plane had decor of the 70's and 80's and many of the video screens around me were broken, including mine. On the brighter side, the flight crew was pleasant and the food good. Outside of the uncomfortable seat, the flight would have been grand. On the return trip, I did sit in an exit row and can honestly say it was a very pleasant flight.

When I checked in I found that my seat had been changed from that which I selected a couple of months earlier, even though the seat configuration was unchanged. We were taken in a hot bus from the terminal to the aircraft, then made to wait as we couldn't board. An hour after take off they came to take a drinks order. I chose a gin and tonic and was offered ice and lemon which I chose. Almost half an hour after that my drink came. A glass with a small piece of lemon; no ice, and tellingly, not a single bubble in the liquid. I tasted it and suspect it was vodka and still water. I told the attendant it was obviously not gin and tonic and she said she would change it. But by now they had started serving dinner so I opted for a glass of wine, guessing they couldn't get that wrong. The salmon starter was excellent. After that I had selected the pea soup and fish. But she brought me chicken kebab. She changed it. I was asked what I would like for desert and I replied that I would chose from the trolley. She said they don’t do the desert trolley any more. I wonder if it doesn’t fit as the aisles are so narrow it is a squeeze for two people to pass. I had some delicious ice cream then the cheese plate. The latter was so cold and the cheeses so hard they had no taste. Also I had to ask for bread or crackers to go with the cheese. Then to sleep. First problem was getting flat. Although I am average height I couldn't get my feet far enough into the feet area to lower the rest of my body on to the bed. A steward saw the problem and explained that the only way is to raise the bed half up after they have made it. Lye down on it, then press the button and the bed moves me towards the foot space and my head goes flat on the pillow. Overall I did not like the seat/bed. Feels like being encapsulated in a black cube. Half of one window is blocked by the side of the “cube”, though it appears it could be cut away serving no purpose. The windows were set on dark all during the cruise, meaning impossible to see clearly out of the window even though much of the 12 hour flight was in daylight. Breakfast was good and uneventful. Arrival some 20 minutes early. Priority luggage came mixed with all the other luggage. To end on something positive. The increased hydration on the B787 had a positive effect and I got off the plane feeling so much better then I normally do after long flights.

The crew showed little concern for the issue even though repeated requests were made by various passengers to the crew around rows 5-12 on the 737-800. I noticed that the crew were congregated in the rear galley for most of the flight where the temperature seemed just right! I find this unacceptable as I was travelling with an elderly relative who really struggled in these conditions. The cabin temp on this flight must have been at least 26C+. The issue seemed to be very high ambient cabin temperature combined with a lot of heat generated from seatback entertainment screens. Apart from this major issue the in-flight product was good with comfortable seats, acceptable legroom, a full meal service, one free drinks run and free in-flight entertainment. Although the crew were superficially friendly, they seemed to have little interest (or any reasonable explanation) as to why it was so hot. In addition to this, I also noticed that they also failed to get a full row of seats to return their seats to the upright position for landing which I also found pretty lax.",Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bodrum to London,September 2019,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,3,no,False,Bodrum,London,

The aircraft was a new A321-neo and the hard product was in great shape with seats offering decent pitch and large IFE screens. The service was quite good for a short, 45-minute flight and included a sandwich and a selection of non-alcoholic beverages. The FA’s had a poor command of English which TK seems to ignore. The flight departed and landed on time. As the aircraft was taxiing to its stand, several passengers stood up and walked to the front of the plane without any intervention from the flight attendants.

Onboard the brand new A321neo, the business class had the proper seating unlike many other European carriers which simply leave the middle seat of economy style seats empty. The seats were wider than some lie-flat seats I had experienced and had a good recline complete with a footrest. Each seat had its individual IFE screens which were quite large and had a good selection of movies and music. After take-off we were served breakfast which had a delicious selection of pastries, cheeses and fruit followed by a hot entree. At the end of breakfast, I was offered Turkish coffee which was served with a Turkish Delight on the side. The crew were super polite and readily available and they called on the passengers regularly. Flight pushed back on time and arrived slightly ahead of schedule. Having flown Turkish several times in recent years and occasionally written not-so-flattering reviews, I must say this flight was nearly perfect in all aspects - great aircraft, attentive service, on-schedule performance, good IFE and wifi and great food.

882,J Mee,United States,2019-08-16,9,"Los Angeles to Samara via Istanbul. My final destination was Kazakhstan via Istanbul Turkey and Samara Russia. My wife and I do not need a visa to enter Russia; however, we found out in an airport before checking in that our new born baby need a visa to enter Russia even if it is transit. Its our mistake that US passport holder needs a visa to enter Russia even if short transit. You can not image how frustrate in this situation when you are ready flight with a new born baby. Los Angeles ground staff felt sorry for us and tried to solve this issue and even called Russia consulate in Samara to see any other options for this case; unfortunately, there was no options to enter Russia without a visa with U.S. passport holder. They said ""sorry to us so many times; but, at the same time, they keep looking for any other options"". Eventually, I decided to purchase new ticket to go Kazakhstan without transit via Russia; however, a staff explain that if we miss or give up one of five flights, (there is five flights on our itinerary), rest of flights will be canceled as per an airline policy. so we have to flight to Russia in order not to lose all flights. so I called Expedia to see what is our option for this case. As I expected, we have to purchase entire new tickets which is $8,500. Expedia said that is only option since that is an airline policy. I thought Turkish airline is the only one can solve this issue even if I purchased tickets via Expedia. So I started to convince them we will take all responsibilities even if we lose tickets. told me ""just let us fly to Kazakhstan then I will purchase new ticket to fly there without entering Russia and please just remove our name from the list of flight from Istanbul to Samara Russia"". Finally, they helped us to fly to Istanbul and then Almaty Kazakhstan without lose tickets. Once we arrived at Kazakhstan, we were able to apply Russia Transit visa for our baby so we can fly to Istanbul via Samara Russia to return to U.S. I felt that these staff in Los Angeles mind was that they want to help customers and take time to try to solve the issue even if they were doing against their policy.

The aircraft was small from London to Istanbul, however the aircraft from Istanbul to Dubai was slightly bigger. I would have thought they would had bigger and better planes as London is a more international city but I was wrong. The customer service from stewards was poor. They did not smile and the level of English was inadequate as they could not answer basic questions i.e do you herbal tea. Equally, the food was terrible and tasteless. We were given something like toast. They should stick to traditional food like bulgar with kofta or shawarma. This would have been better. On the plus side. Entertainment system was good and had good choice of movies etc including Turkish TV series 'Ertugrul'.

884,Syed Azhar,United States,2019-08-14,1,"Istanbul to Boston. Our worst travel experience with Turkish Airline ever. We flew along with 2 kids(3 & 6 year old ) and had a food allergy. Individual Seat assignments: Our seats were confirmed 25D,E,F,G but they re-assigned seats for all of us separately(30D, 24B, 19J, fourth boarding pass got missing in chaos but it was a separate seat) . We are having a hard time understanding how a 3 year old child can travel unaccompanied? When we asked for the reason, they did not have an explanation. We stood on the airplane gate for half an hour when finally they assigned, separately, two seats for mom and daughter together and two seats for dad and son together just before take off (gate was closed and we were literally standing on the gate whole time during boarding process). These seats were not even anywhere close together (Row 27 for mom and daughter and row 9 for dad and son). When I asked how this could happen when I had called and already had confirmed seats, the guy at the gate (part of cabin crew) was extremely rude and replied very rudely that he doesn’t know what happened but he is trying to help us find a seat. Apparently he did not think anything of letting a 3 year old and a 6 year old sit together. The two female flight attendants were a bit nicer and they said to him in Turkish that a child cannot sit alone (they were speaking in Turkish but I could tell that’s what they said because they pointed to my kids).  Staff is so unprofessional and rude. When we checked in, we simply asked reason for not assigning seats together (please note that I had called the airline and made sure that we have seats together), the person on the desk was rude and was not replying to our questions. He simply gave the reason, in broken English, that the plane has changed that caused the problem when we asked why it was taking so long to check us in and if everything was ok. However, plane was not changed and he simply lied to us. Poor communication skills: The big problem was, they don’t understand/speak English well. When we asked reason why they assigned our confirmed seats to someone else, the person on the check-in counter could not explain in English and he got frustrated as he as was trying to explain in broken English which was hard for us to understand. In his frustration, he stated showing his rudeness. The same situation was on the plane, whey they were trying to get seats for us, we asked crew members how did this happen? they simply could not reply in English and ultimately replied with rudeness, again it was language problem but I feel that the females were nicer than the man at the door of the plane, who was part of the cabin crew. The other guy was polite and ok who was serving me food but the guy at the door (part of the cabin crew) was extremely rude). He was the one we asked how this could happen when our flight was confirmed and he responded rudely. We asked if at least two of us could sit together behind each other (2 seats in front and 2 in back) and he said yes and told mom and daughter to follow him (all the way to row 27), yet dad and son were told to wait there and were given seats in row 9. Mom was waiting for dad and son to show up close to mom and daughter, but that did not happen. Dad in row 9, had to call a flight attendant and ask where mom and daughter were. He was then led to our seat all the way in the back of the plane to show us where we were.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Boston,August 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Istanbul,Boston,

889,Iryna Stynska,United States,2019-08-07,1,"I had bought tickets for my flight from San Francisco to Kyiv via Istanbul in advance. Few days before the flight day I had called to Turkish Airline Customer service to double-check if everything has changed about my flight and the representative told me that they got only small updates about my way back tickets. They have changed the time for 5 minutes later and the airport. She did not mention anything else about my upcoming flight to Kyiv. After arriving at the airport to Istanbul I came to the Turkish airline front desk to ask them about the hotel service. Since my layout time is 13 hours they supposed to offer me to stay in the hotel, and for this reason, I have chosen this airline. It is their written policy. I’ve been waiting in the line for about 30 minutes. The representative told me that there is some update on my flight, they have alternative flight that is sooner than 13 hours and they cannot offer me the hotel, but at the same time they cannot offer me a new ticket to the alternative flight; moreover, I must pay extra money for that ticket. They changed the airport of arrival so why do I need to pay in this case? Is it legal at all? I just want to mention that when I was booking my tickets these 13 hours connection time and old airport were the only options. Their system does not show any other flights. After I have been waiting for his decision more than 30 minutes at the front desk, he told me that he even cannot check that alternative flight for me and provide with some more information about its costs or how can I get that ticket. He said that I need to go to another front desk that is after security check out. I went to another front desk and there was a huge line of yelling people who missed their flight because of the delay. I was patiently waiting for another one and a half hour in the line and after, another representative told me the same story that I must pay extra money for upgrading my ticket because they are not going to provide me the hotel room. They said that since there is another option for me to get to Kyiv earlier and I need to pay for that, they cannot give me the room. Representatives were referring to their policy about offering the free hotel room. I want to mention that six months ago when I was purchasing my tickets there were NOT other option with layout less than 13 hours, 13 hours layout was the only option on their website that’s why I bought it because they provide a hotel to stay that 13 hours. They told me that I can contact their manager which is located on Turkish Airline Hotel Desk after Passport control. I went there. After another long line I finally met 3rd different representative that told me the same story about their policy and referred me to the ticket exchange desk to exchange my ticket to a sooner flight, but he said that it is usually some small fee for exchanging but they cannot tell how much exactly and I need to go to another front desk. I went there and 4th representative announced that I must pay 150 Dollars to exchange my tickets to flight sooner! Is it some kind of joke? I have already paid for the tickets if the airline has changed their flight, why do I need to pay for that? By denying the hotel service they put customers in a difficult situation and tired customers had no choice there to argue, they buy that more expensive tickets other ways they going to sleep on the floor at the airport.

She was mortified as it was a new scooter costing around £1800 and she does not have a lot of money so buying a new one is not so easy. She was taken to one of there offices were the person dealing with this matter told her not to worry at all and that they would get the scooter repaired ASAP and that she should take it back home with here and they would arrange collection. We then got a call from someone saying that they will not be collecting it but instead they asked my disabled mother to take the scooter to a repair shop, get a quote and send it to them and then they will pay for the repair. We did that and after 2 some time they got back to us saying that what we sent them was a quote and they need an invoice even though they asked for a writen quote.

I spoke on the phone with a customer service representative with your airline for ticketing and reservations. I am outraged and disappointed in the terrible customer service and appalling company policy Turkish Airlines has for families with children. From my understanding with the rep and manager today, if a family is traveling with an infant, the only place they can sit is a bassinet accessible seat. In order to receive this seat with my family and babies - we have to pay an additional $109 per person, per seat - going both ways round trip! That’s over $600 extra for my family. This is a terrible policy and is basically punishing and penalizing families with infants. I have flown internationally on 2 other trips before with a different airline, and there was never  an additional fee to accommodate a family to be able to sit together with their infant, with a bassinet accessible seat. I am travelling with my 2 boys and husband. In addition to this my sister, her spouse, my mother and her spouse are also going to be on the same flight with us. Our entire family has already spent plenty of money as your customers for our flight and now we are being penalized and asked to pay additional money to have a bassinet seat?!? Turkish airlines is punishing families by enforcing additional financial burdens on families. After my conversation with the customer service rep and her manager, it is clear to me that the Turkish Airlines customer services reps only care about repeating, over & over, the company policy as an excuse or escape route to avoiding good customer services. Not once did they display any empathy or understanding that as a mother, I do not want to sit by myself with my infant son, and be forced to take care of all his needs, by myself, for a 12 hour flight. Long flights are difficult for babies and families and we need help to make sure its a safe and smooth flight for our children and family.

I am informed at the airport, this is standard operating procedure for Turkish Airlines arriving in ADD.  Had to go to the airport at 1 a.m. for 3 days before my baggage was located as there was no “system” to inform me of the status of my bags. Now flying back on 7/19, flight from IST to ORD delayed by 160 minutes. As a result, will miss connecting flight at ORD. I will have to pay for my own accommodation at ORD or opt to stay in IST and go out the following day taking the same risk for a flight delay. (flight on 7/18 was also delayed by the same amount of time) At three customer service desks at three different locations of the IST airport, I asked to be routed through ATL and was told I must pay my own way from ATL to XNA as the only flight out that night was Delta it was not Star Alliance. And they will terminate my flight at ATL. I opted into that. The process of talking to agents (many, as no one seems to have the authority to make decision) took 1.5 hours which possibly caused episode 3 below. My baggage did not make it to ATL on 7/19 on TK31. And as of this morning (7/21) according to the customer service agent, the system doesn’t show where my bag maybe. Advised next steps: wait until tomorrow a.m. 48 hours after my flight, and submit a lost baggage claim; which will start a process to “reimburse for lost luggage” or “expedite the search”. BTW – since I opted to get my flight terminated and paid $500 for my last leg of the flight, TK will not deliver my bag to my final destination. I will have to pay a FedEx fee for that.

We waited for 30 minutes, only to meet the person who informed that our baggage was left in Istanbul as the flight was overweight. We weren't provided with any proper reports for the same and the personnel just wrote our details on a paper while promising us to deliver us baggage to our hotel in Cappadocia, the next morning (a pathetic manner to handle such situation where no official report is made). Next morning, I called, emailed concerned authorities hundreds of times and never received an appropriate response. The only thing I got to hear was to call someone else or I should speak in the Turkish language because the people there do not understand English (which is horrible for someone who works at an airport). In fact, one of the personnel lied saying my baggage has left for Cappadocia. After all the frustration, I drove 1 hour to Kayseri airport to collect my baggage. Nobody was there to check if we are collecting the right baggage (anybody can take anyone's else bags). No proper report was given. The next afternoon (after more than 48 hours), someone called us asking whether we took our baggage or not. This is not only horrible, pathetic service from Turkish Airlines, but it is downright fraud and cheating where you people lie to keep the passengers quiet and show no responsibility towards the safety of our luggage.

Avoid transiting with TA at all costs when their direct competitors in the ME are so far ahead for quality and service it is hard to believe. This giant white elephant airport is doomed to fail. These thoughts are in addition to the horrendous customer service I endured today while traveling with two small children and no partner. We had unforeseen delays at immigration of almost 1 hour yet (the only photocopy station is 300 yards away).

There was a young woman who was speaking very loudly with her group. Thinking nothing of it, I stood up to get off the plane. A minute later she puts BOTH hands and me and shoves me to the side – into the seats - to get to her group. I can handle a little push, scootch past - but a two-handed forceful shove is too much. I told her to chill out and wait. She started yelling at me in another language (I don’t know which), taunting me and laughing at the back of my head - with her group laughing too. As we were getting off the plane, she was directly behind me and I stopped and informed the young female flight attendant stationed at the back of the plane that this woman - pointing to her - just forcefully pushed me with both hands. Flight attendant - no kidding - shrugged her shoulders and said ""So?"" Thinking she didn't understand, I repeated it. The FA then laughed aloud and said clearly ""Well, what do you want me to do about it?"" I said ""You are telling me that I can punch someone on this flight and you will do nothing?"" She laughed and again said ""What can I do?"". This was in front of my husband, the woman who pushed me and one of her companions. Shocked I got off the plane and at the bottom of the stairs I explained the situation to the ground crew and the Turkish Airlines Security that was on the ground to get us on the bus to take us to the gate. They told me ""Tell it to Customer Service in the airport."" Still stunned I argued and questioned ""You aren't going to do anything?"" They said ""Get on the bus."" At the terminal, I went to the customer Service and once they found someone who spoke even high school English I was told - no kidding - to call Customer Service. I could not believe this. Again, I said “I have spoken to the flight crew, security, ground crew, customer service but you are telling me I need to call customer service. I'm talking to you now!"" They said No. I said ""OK, can I use your phone?"" They laughed (so much laughing in this experience) and said ""We don't have a phone."" At no point did a Turkish Airlines employee say to me - ""Are you OK? "" Not once. I then stood to the side and called Customer Service thinking Someone at this company has to care about passenger safety. Wrong. When I called - I am not kidding - they told me to go online and submit a Feedback form!! Which I did. Getting no response in the 1st 24 hours I called after no response after 48 hours. Again TA was rude and just told me to wait. I said ""So you are telling me that after being physically accosted on your flight, after having spoken to the flight crew, security, ground crew, customer service at the airport and customer service on the phone - all of whom did nothing - that now I should wait 2-7 days for an email?” I finally got an answer from Turkish Airlines today which read ""In our investigation we corresponded with related department. We could not detect any inconviences (sic) regarding your feedback."" I have written again & again & each time they tell me that no one corroborates my story.

We had to go to the counter before we were I formed that our flight has again been changed to 5:30pm. No one, i mean no one saw it fit to announce the change to us. I then requested to speak to their manager or supervisor and was directed to another Turkish airline desk. staff here state they have no manager, i even exclaimed ‘how can you work here and not know your manager or supervisor’. I eventually met a gentleman who said he is the supervisor but has closed for the day, when i asked who he handed over to, he replied that i wait 10mins after he is gone then proceed to the counter to ask who the new supervisor is. I just lost it at this point. Poor service from staff, it’s as though they attend a class on how to be rude to customers. Flights delayed without the courtesy to inform us.

In-flight services were ok. But my suitcase was damaged and I did not get a refund. The problem is not the value of the suitcase in itself but the level of blatant deception I've been exposed to, something I had never seen before in 20 years of flying. If you fly Turkish Airlines and everything goes fine, all is good. But if your luggage gets damaged during the trip, be prepared to be treated as if it's none of their business, as with a low-cost airline. I feel lucky that the luggage was not lost at least. Here is what happened. First, the company claimed that the suitcase was already damaged when I had checked it in. In fact, I packed my coat into the suitcase in front of the check in desk right before dropping it, so I am absolutely sure that the suitcase was not damaged then. Someone replaced the label on the suitcase after the check it to mark it as already damaged at check in. The airline actually has a record of this in their system so the customer service staff could verify that this happened and issue a refund, but they never bothered. Upon my arrival in Doha, I have not had a chance to talk to the airline staff directly, so I was told by the airport staff to open a complaint by sending an email to the address of the airline's local office. That email was never replied. I talked to the airline staff when I flew back and contacted the customer service, which just resulted in a long series of interactions in which staff will tell you to just wait and file complaints after complaints until you give up.",,Business,Economy Class,New York to Doha via istanbul,March 2019,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,3,no,True,New York,Doha,istanbul

938,J Calson,Ukraine,2019-05-24,1,"Kiev to Male via Istanbul. Two days lost and headaches all the way to our wedding. Horrible experience from start to finish with Turkish Airlines on our wedding/honeymoon trip from Kiev to Maldives. Sorry for the lengthy post. I will try to make it as concise as possible. Website and Mobile App issues: After creating my online profile, I needed to update my name to include my middle name, as it shows on my passport. Once my tickets were issued from Expedia, Turkish Airlines website and App couldn’t link the ticket to my Miles&Smiles profile because of the name discrepancy. It took several calls and emails to support, and even now it still shows my first name and middle name combined. Couldn’t update my rewards number: I mistakenly had the wrong Miles&Smiles number on my Expedia account when I purchased the tickets (copy/pasted without the last digit). Turkish airlines couldn’t update my ticket with the correct rewards number. Sure, it was my mistake, but it seemed like a simple request to update my ticket. Flight schedule change: Our flight times from IST to MLE on April 30th change from arriving at 11:50am to arriving 12:15pm, which was not a big deal, but logging into their website and App the system asked me to confirm the change, cancel the flight, or change the flight. There was no option to confirm the change. I couldn’t change my flight (which was free of charge). Every time I’d select the new flight arriving in MLE at 12:15, the system would say it couldn’t find a flight with that time. I made several calls to Turkish Airlines support, and they never helped me clarify if I was confirmed on the changed flight. The best they could do was tell me to contact Expedia and have them re-issue tickets. Between Turkish Airlines and Expedia support, I must have made a half dozen calls regarding this. By the end, Turkish airlines best response was that “everything should be fine”. All I wanted to know is that everything IS fine”. Cancelled flight from KBP to IST: As we were about to board our flight from KBP to IST on April 29th at 9:30pm, we were told at the gate that our flight was cancelled. • It took 6 hours to stand in line for new tickets. Calling customer support, the guy was rude and told me to just wait in line. When calling Expedia’s Gold customer support to get me a new flight, they were unable to assist because the Turkish Airlines flight was not showing an updated status, and that the flight was still on-time. Expedia could have helped me get new tickets, but they just needed to confirm the flight was cancelled. Expedia even called Turkish Airlines to get updates, and Turkish Airlines was unable to give them the cancelled status. So, after several calls to Turkish airlines and Expedia, we just continued to wait in line. We eventually got new tickets to IST, which left Kiev at 10am the next day (April 30th) and arrived in IST at 12pm. However, our connection from IST to MLE was at 1:00am that morning on April 30th, arriving in MLE at 12:15pm. The next flight from IST to MLE was at 4:15am on May 1st arriving in MLE at 2:20pm. • Turkish Airlines did put us up in a hotel for a few hours, since our new departure wasn’t unto 4:15am the next day. But, the customer service representatives in IST airport were all rude and lacked any empathy. The hotel (Ibis Hotel) was a 1-hour drive from the airport The room was dirty. Sheets stained.

First of all our flight was delayed for over an hour, but that’s fine we crossed that bridge, then when we arrived in İstanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight. Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from İstanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days.  I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see what’s the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think it’s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that there’s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didn’t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because it’s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they can’t get it. And she said you know it’s your fault that it went to Eilat.

When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: ""Wait a minute"".. I didn't want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.""The flight is full!"". And it is still not the end of the troubles, instead of being delayed 40 minutes the ""great"" TA let me wait one hour longer in comparison with original departure schedule.

I have no leg, I move on a prosthesis. The choice of a comfortable place is important for my sick leg. When I flying from Hurghada – at the reception manager not given our pre-selected seats. He give to me uncomfortable seats in the tail of the aircraft, although I chose a seats for 4 months before departure. Turkish Airlines does not have Internet check-in when passengers departing from Hurghada.

In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights – in two ways!

They told us to go to the ticket desk when we arrived and before we checked in to be given options. The options were an 8 hour wait in Istanbul airport for the next flight (no thank you after an 11 hour flight) or the same flights a day later. We opted for the second option of flying on our original flight choices day later. The lady on the desk suggested that we claim afterwards for the extra hotel night and the extra day car hire.

When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-in… After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasn’t going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasn’t I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do.

On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything that’s happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlines’ fault and that they didn’t follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me. I’ve tried contacting them Jan 4, Jan 6, Jan 9, Jan 15, Jan 16, Jan 20, Jan 22, Jan 25, Jan 29, Feb 1, Feb 4, Feb 14, and Feb 20. Every time I’ve tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me they’ll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but it’s been 2 months now and I haven’t heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didn’t they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that they’ll fully refund me, but aren’t now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what I’ve been through. It’s been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews).

1018,T Barlin,Canada,2019-02-20,4,"Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The ""Onboard Chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.",A330 / A321,Business,Business Class,Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul,February 2019,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,True,Montreal,Berlin,Istanbul

While it was written on the Turkish website that they would give a hotel room if the stay over is 12 hours or more, there was no such opportunity. Turkish airlines staff at the airport had limited English proficiency, lack of decency (rude), and lower motivation to cooperate. However, instead of a hotel room, a lady at the counter offered me snacks. When I requested for lunch instead of snacks or breakfast, the lady just tore the check she wrote in front of me.

1020,K Darzane,United States,2019-02-17,1,"In 9/30/2018 my wife, our 11 months old son, and myself took Turkish Airlines to fly from San Francisco to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment.  This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the “Transfer” station where we can request to be booked to another flight.  We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they don’t give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wife’s US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours  and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind.  We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers. For the next 24 hours, we were prisoners in Istanbul airport. I regret my decision to fly Turkish and I will never fly them again.

1021,M Králik,Malaysia,2019-02-17,5,"My first time on Turkish. It's not a bare-basics, race-to-the-bottom product, but it's far behind Asian carriers and Qatar Airways in warmth and sophistication. There is a lot of confusion both in the cockpit and at the Istanbul transit area. Passengers are given the wrong information. My flight ex-KUL taxied all over the airport for 2 hours before returning to gate for refuelling. (We were just about to take off on a 11.5-hour journey with not enough fuel? Interesting.) That just about put paid to everyone's plans to catch their connecting flights. The gate number for my Geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as I found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). Very stressful. On board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. English is not great unless pre-recorded. Male crew are quite patient and hard-working. The female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. Sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be. (How hard is it to say ""Good evening"" to a passenger during boarding, instead of giving an icy, silent stare?)

We had to rushed back to counter for them to issue another boarding pass and during this time it was already chaotic. Then they gave us options whather to take the next earliest flight but will arrive in Istanbul Sabiha airport and not Istanbul Ataturk airport. Another option is to take another flight but had to wait for another 9 hours. We took the first option because Turkish airlines promise that our luggage will be sent to Sabiha airport when we landed. Once landed, waited for around 45 mins - 1 hour for our luggage but none arrived including others that took the same option as ours. Few minutes later one of the staff came and informed us that all the luggage are left in Vienna. This became even more chaotic as passengers have other arrangements and obviously requires the luggage. The staff told us to file baggage lost at the counter and the queue itself took almost 2 hours. Turkish Airlines again made another promise that they would send it by the next morning to our hotel but again we still have not receive our luggage the next morning. Fortunately our hotel staff helped us to follow up on this matter and again Turkish Airlines made another promise that the luggage will be sent tomorrow evening. So day 3 In Istanbul with recycled sweaty clothes and no luggage. We are really hopeful that it will be sent by tomorrow evening as we are going back in few days.

We ordered two pieces of replacement covers and sent the receipts to THY. This was on the 19th of January. Since then we've been trying to resolve the case but we are being ignored. Today I talked to customer service for the 5th time. Every time I'm told that we should hear back in couple days but we never do. This is such a shame. What we claim is not even that much.

1030,G Larina,Slovakia,2019-02-10,1,"I am flying from Vienna to Singapore with a layover in Istanbul for 11 hours. I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to it´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me ""No, tour is finished"". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that's what I'm doing now). I would like to highlight that all I wanted was to do the tour on my way to Singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen.

Drinks were served after take off in a punctual fashion and was soon followed by a superb in flight meal of lamb kebab and rice, a good looking vegetarian Dahl was available too. Drinks included average wines and rice beer, along with soft drinks and Turkish coffee. The cabin crew where good and well turned out, including a chef working in the galley for business class passengers. The rest of the flight was fine.

The luggage was tags were printed fine all the way to Atyrau but the Turkish Airlines Supervisor asked the agent to check it only yo Istanbul. He was rude and obnoxious. He claimed that this was because I have two different ticket numbers which is very common anywhere else on earth. He said the same to someone else who was going to London but he received a phone call from superiors to make this passenger luggage go all the way to London. When I complained, he threatened to float my flight. He was shouting at everyone and when when his colleagues offered to intervene, he shut them down.

1047,H Mazaresh,United States,2019-01-18,1,Mumbai to Los Angeles via Istanbul. The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided.  Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good.

1049,Frederick Lansky,United States,2019-01-17,1,"Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn't select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn't select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was ""it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass"""" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn't have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I'm not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport ""the next day."" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn't end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn't have my bag. Then they said that they couldn't pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a ""repair invoice"" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu. At that point I had already thrown my damaged baggage away.

They have EU Family visas and no return ticket is required. We were forced to purchase 3 tickets that were not needed at a cost of R27,000. The flight was delayed almost one hour due to a technical problem. Due to this delay we missed the connecting flight to Toulouse. Turkish Airlines staff were incredibly unhelpful and uncaring. The sales desk demanded I buy new tickets at a price of R40,000 ($2,800) and I refused. Customer service was pathetic. The helpline from the sales desk needed a Turkish speaker to understand the process. I was on the phone for over 30 minutes twice explaining what had happened, and was told to to wait a few hours. They would call or email me; but there is no free WiFi or cell phone signal in the arrival terminals. I checked in every couple hours for 12 hours.  The sales desk said they could not give me free connecting flights as the flight was full and the cost was R40,000 ($2,800). They could give me next day tickets to Paris, which is at least 8 hours drive from my destination.  Istanbul airport staff in general were a nightmare to speak to in English, with an attitude of indifference. They were callous and rude at every encounter even though I was friendly, polite and upbeat. From 6 am until 2pm we had no access to proper food or drinks, except pretzels and sweets from a kiosk.  We slept in the airport on the benches - my wife and I with two hyper active kids aged 6 and 8. It was a nightmare. Waited 24 hours before the next flight, and 12 of those hours we were anxious and traumatized by the situation and staff. Arrived in Paris next day, only to find baggage had not been forwarded. This after I had discussed how the baggage worked. I saw the consultant print the new baggage tags and make changes on the system. Filled in the missing baggage report at the airport. Baggage arrived 5 days later by courier. Broken. The telescopic handle was broken off and the hard case was cracked about 15 cm. A soft case had holes in from friction. I've reported this to customer service and received no response except an automated message.  I've attempted to claim compensation on the baggage delay, but the website form doesn't work. We came from super hot summer in South Africa to - 2 degree winter and needed to buy new shoes, jackets and other basics for 4 people at a cost of $800.

The check-in was fast as there weren't any queue and the staff work very professionally. i received a priority pass at the security. The airport is huge so I need sometime to walk to the gate. I visited the United Airlines lounge near the gate which was large, modern, clean, had friendly staff and had wide selection of food and drinks. After staying in the lounge I headed to the gate early like it said on the time board but I had to wait at the gate very long and the queue as disorganized and passenger both business and economy were held for another half an hour before boarding. After boarding, I got welcomed by the crew handed out a welcome drink and a menu for lunch. The seat was fully flat, modern and comfortable but the remote control was old and the distance to the magazines was unacceptable and the storage areas was poor. The flight was delayed as the traffic at Heathrow was bad. The in-flight entertainment system which had wide selection of movies, TV programs and many more. The meal was served an hour after takeoff, the food made up of Turkish food which was nice but it tasteless and the option in the menu was poor. The toilet was clean and modern. The flight arrived on time in Istanbul. The airport was crowded, old and had lack of renovation. Fortunately, I had an access to the lounge which was large,clean but crowded, lack of food options and seats. I spent and hour before head to the gate for my flight to Bangkok. The airport was huge and I nearly missed the priority boarding as the time board show the gate late. The service and facilities was the same as the previous flight but the seat included the amenity kit which is really useful on this 10 hour flight. The crew weren't friendly on this flight and not motivated. The flight arrived in Bangkok in the afternoon on the next day on time.

Because of that most flights are delayed and there are no places to sit while waiting for a delayed flight. Then really amateur services kick in when the employees start calling for all passengers to group in the back of the room for passport check only to move again to the front after that for the boarding. The fact that I booked extra legroom seat and a plane was changed without any notification (resulting in regular seat) only adds to an unpleasant experience.

1074,Thea Hallak,Belgium,2018-12-22,1,"Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut. We have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. To start, we have booked our Christmas tickets on July 1st to secure a place for a fair price. The night before the flight. We go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from Istanbul to Beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from Brussels. The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100€ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360€ per person to 680€ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn't do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. To try to rectify the situation, I have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. After staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. Missed our solution option with the plane leaving. I stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. Our file is ""still in process"" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. This company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. Insults the customer and their intelligence. Hires people who neither have the proper English nor the empathy to deal with a client. Is frustrating and shameful. I am missing important family moments I have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. As for recommendations if you want to go to Beirut. Pegasus, a low cost, is much more efficient and respectful. Middle East airlines was definitely a good experience, I had a problem once with Aegean airlines, but they solved it on the spot not leaving for me room to complain.

None of them actually care about their company which reflects on the leadership. Therefore the customer experience is bad all around. You get what you pay for and that’s Turkish airlines for you. The incident that prompted this review is the fact that I dropped my glasses. I waited for all the passengers to leave and then started looking for them. As I was looking for them, their crew instead of helping asked me to leave the plane assuring me that they will look for it and bring it to baggage claim. When I reached baggage claim they said wait for a few minutes and we will let you know. Another 15 min go by and they found them, told me to pick them up at the check in counter at departures. So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me it’ll be 45 min and they can’t mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by  and nothing. So basically 500 dollar glasses down the drain. Bottom line, if you drop something don’t leave the plane, they will try to push you out and then they wouldn’t care.

However I can not see TK moving all operations in less than a month without damaging their overall product and reputation as the new airport still lacks a proper lounge (the Turkish Airlines Corner arrangement although a improvement from a weeks ago still just a makeshift), restaurants, retail and other basic facilities.

Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased. They put us in a hotel and I contacted them 11 times and objected twice as they refused to pay me back for the visa purchased. They finally agreed to pay only 28 USD but what I actually paid was 70 USD. On the way back , they were also delayed for 3 hours and again I missed my connection flight and the exact same happened. Only this time they had no straight flights to Canada. So I had to fly to Heathrow and from there to Toronto. Workers are rude and they told me : well, if you think we are always late then just don’t take Turkish Airlines. I hated every aspect of that trip, they need to work on their customer service.

On board the hard product was decent and having chosen an emergency exit row I had plenty of legroom. The service was extremely slow and by the time I received my lunch it was already cold.

The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time.

Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FA’s did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them.

We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket.

Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce.

Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius!

Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn't. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR. Case is not yet closed.

Seat pitch presented a decent amount of legroom for a narrowbody plane. Breakfast served was delicious too, and with metal cutlery no less! First time on Turkish and I'm impressed.

Plane was due to depart at 1100 but when we went to the gate as advised, the inbound passengers were not being allowed to deplane as the next gate along was loading for departure and presumably the staff were worried that the passengers might get confused. Eventually, we boarded and found we had the business class cabin to ourselves. Plane left 45 minutes late and the service during the flight was, as to be expected, superb. Food was good and tasty and we were able to sleep on this section. The cabin crew were very good. Because of the delay, we were short of time in Istanbul and were ushered straight to our next flight bypassing security. The flight from Istanbul to Ercan was aboard a A321 with the 2+2 seating layout. Boarding for this flight was chaotic as is normal for this airport. The flight was only 1 hour 20 minutes so it was not too bad, but premium economy would be a better description of the business class cabin.

Two weeks before departure we were advised that the flight to Istanbul Nairobi had been anticipated and that therefore we would have had only one hour of call but that we would have done it easily (before confirming the acceptance of the flight change, we talked with the customer service Turkish who gave us confirmation - I hope that the phone calls are recorded, as well as an email in which we confirmed that we would have made it). As expected, the flight from Venice to Istanbul leaves late. We get off the plane at 18.05. The flight to Nairobi would leave at 18.40 but already on the panel appeared written ""gate closed"". We go to the gate and at 18.15 we are there the flight was due to leave at 18.40) and the gate is actually closed and the plane has already left. They send us to a desk for customer support that is not the right one and we find out after 10 minutes of waiting thanks to another customer who warns us. After having gone through 3 Turkish desk (Ataturk airport is not really small ...) we arrive at the correct one where in an absolutely rude manner they warn us that we would have to wait 24 hours for the next plane. Without baggage. They still give us assistance by providing us with a hotel and full board. They ask us if we prefer it near the airport or the center of istanbul and we ask that it be the center. They make us get on a bus without telling us where we were going and leave us in a hotel near the airport ... no ifs and buts, without even the foresight to say: sorry in the center was all full. We lose 24 hours of vancaza, the hotel booked in Nariobi, the various visits etc. ruined holiday. We are asking for a refund.

Due settimane prima della partenza siamo stati avvisati che il volo Istanbul Nairobi era stato anticipato e che quindi avremmo avuto solo un'ora di scalo ma che ce l'avremmo fatta agevolmente (prima di confermare l'accettazione del cambio volo, abbiamo parlato con il customer service Turskish che ci ha dato conferma - spero che le telefonate siano registrate, oltre che ad una mail in cui ci confermavano che ce l'avremmo fatta). Come c'era da aspettarsi, il volo da Venezia ad Istanbul parte in ritardo. Scendiamo dall'aereo alle 18.05.

Ci fiondiamo al gate e alle 18.15 siamo lì (ribadisco il volo sarebbe dovuto partire alle 18.40) ed il gate è effettivamente chiuso e l'aereo è anche già partito. Ci mandano ad un desk per assistenza clienti che non è quello corretto e lo scopriamo dopo 10 minuti di attesa grazie ad un'altra cliente che ci avvisa. Dopo per essere passati per 3 desk Turkish ( l'aeroporto Ataturk non è proprio piccolo... ) arriviamo a quello corretto dove in maniera assolutamente sgarbata ci avvisano che avremmo dovuto aspettare 24 ore per l'aereo successivo. Senza bagaglio. Ci danno comunque assistenza fornendoci un albergo e pensione completa. Ci chiedono se lo preferiamo vicino all'aeroporto o al centro di istanbul e chiediamo che sia il centro.

Boarding started without an announcement and despite a clearly marked priority lane, it was a free for all with people forming multiple lines converging at the same spot. When I questioned the gate agent about the lack of announcements and the chaotic boarding, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said we were being bussed to the aircraft and in her mind it did not matter. On board the hard product was very good with real business class seats unlike the other European carriers which simply leave empty the middle seat of a 3x3 configuration in economy. After take off, we were served a tasty lunch with three different choices of main course. Beverage offering was decent and included champagne but the red wine was disappointing. The service by FA’s was good but it seemed quite inefficient with the two serving the rather small business section running back and forth multiple times to deliver a simple drink request. The seats were comfortable and the IFE had a good selection. The flight pushed back late but arrived on time.

Disgusting airport in Istanbul, the list could go on. We were left for over an hour on our flight from Gatwick – Istanbul, the captain came on the radio once to say we were delayed, obviously! No communication whatsoever. Cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. The plane then started moving, followed by taking off yet no checks to see if passengers were sat down or even with their seatbelts on. The plane just took off, not even an announcement was made. We missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles in Istanbul where 9 of us including a 4 year old had to wait at the airport for 17 hours. They were unaccommodating, rude and their customer service ability was non-existent and shocking. They said we could stay in a hotel if we paid for the hotel, taxi and visa. We were left at the transfer desk for 4 hours where we were just repeatedly told wait. They couldn’t tell us anything or help us in any way. When they finally did sort our boarding passes out they had missed one of us off. After 4 hours they then said we could have a food voucher and a rest area, this was gone 4 hours of asking and waiting. When arriving at the rest area the lady working said we couldn’t go in because we had the wrong passport. She found it funny when we pointed out to her that we had a 4 year old asleep in a trolley. She was laughing with her colleague which was infuriating and highly unprofessional. The toilets were disgusting. Another delayed flight made us miss yet another connecting flight to Dubai this time, this resulted in another 9 hours at Dubai airport. It took us 72 hours to get to the Seychelles where we missed 2 days of our holiday. We didn’t think we would have the same carry on returning, unfortunately we did! Another 5 hour delay for what reason it was unknown. Going back to that desk at Istanbul with again rude and unhelpful staff was soul destroying.

I notified the flight attendant, she said ok go back to the end of the plane. I refused to do so! She called the manager , and she told me that those people will not not leave their seats and that’s I have only two options, either to leave the flight immediately and wait for the next flight or to go and accept seat 20C.

They were so cold and unable to empathize, that for that experience alone I would never willfully fly Turkish Airlines again. On the flight I pressed the call button twice because I never had time to grab water and the small glass they give you a couple times isn’t enough for an 11 hour flight. My light was turned off both times and I was ignored each time. I felt sick the entire flight because I needed water desperately. Cabin crew were not very friendly and seemed quite stressed out.

Seeing as to how the domestic flight on Turkish I took (Kayseri to Istanbul was delayed a good 1.5hr just the day before, leaving my Friend stranded in Istanbul for a day due to a missed connection), I was dismayed. I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didn’t know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, it’s ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to it’s revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldn’t detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight! By then it was 30 mins before departure time and the gate was a good 20mins away. I ran like mad to gate 709, and there was no one left. I was hissing mad, this was not even my fault, a delayed flight with a horrible screen layout that couldn’t even tell me 1 hour beforehand my appropriate gate details. And now Turkish airlines is refusing to refund this ticket or cancel the no show fee. I was stranded in Istanbul for another day and had to shell money out for another flight home. Horrific and worst airline experience ever. Throughout the ordeal all Turkish Airline ground staff were rude, short tempered and condescending. They never offered to help or apologise in short putting all blame on their passengers.

1162,Ofer Yitzhak,Israel,2018-08-19,1,"Singapore to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. For some reason the flight to Istanbul was delayed in about 25 minutes so instead of 75 minutes I only had 50 minutes for the connection. Once landed crew called all passengers to Tel Aviv to hurry up (a delay that was caused because of you), now obviously I was in a hurry and thought it's good that they are aware of the problem and since operating both flights probably leave the gate open a few more minutes. I got to the gate and they just closed it, the ground crew was still there and had last passengers on the jet bridge. Frustrating as it was seeing the plane just standing there for about half hour and the only thing separating me from getting back to my mother's funeral on time was a door. I tried explaining your employees about my special circumstances and hoped for some sympathy and possibly help. What actually happened was the complete opposite! I was mistreated and responded with apathy. I know and understand all airlines follow the same protocol but this was even worse than speaking to heartless robots. I asked customer service to please help me out and give me lounge access or even just a wi-fi that works so I can inform my family and friends I'm not going to be on time for the funeral or possibly find an earlier flight. The answer I got is: ""Lounge is only for business passengers"" so I'm not allowed to go there and I can use one of the restaurant's free wi-fi (obviously didn’t work). So had to wait 5 hours for the next flight feeling like nobody cares and really trying to help me. It was not just one of your employees, I spoke to about 8 different people trying to explain my situation and they all kept sending me back and forth until I realized they are just trying to get rid of me.

I am sad to say it wasn't, the seat is fine pretty run of the mill business class, does what it says on the tin and had a decent sleep. Where Turkish airlines fails is in its customer service onboard along with the business class menu. Firstly the service on board, there wasn't any real interaction from the crew with their customers, menus' were given out and I was hurried to complete the breakfast menu for later in the flight, welcome drinks were not served until 20 mins after boarding, and champagne had to be requested. The main meal was served, and although it looked pretty it was pretty bland, I chose the chicken, it was dry and tasteless, I have had economy meals in the past and this spread was very much that but served on china. Way below what I have experienced on other carriers. The breakfast meal was just as bad, mainly all choices are based on eggs. Customer service on board, i had the feeling that the crew looking after its business class passengers were lacking in training to work in this part of the cabin, this was apparent from the lack of interaction, the crew spent all the time they could behind the curtain in the galley talking, never walking the cabin to see how their guests are.",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manila to Istanbul,July 2018,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,True,Manila,Istanbul,

Upon boarding my seat was pointed out to me, I had been settled for 15 minutes before any cabin crew made contact, when I was offered a pre flight drink, orange, lemon mint or water. I requested champagne, and waited another 5 minutes for this to arrive, albeit a very small measure. Flight under way and I was given a handful of menus, for dinner, drinks, wine list and a pre breakfast menu, again I choose champagne as my choice of drink, again I was presented with a small measure. Meal served and what a total disappointment - it looked good if it was colour and presentation you were looking for, and to be honest it was no more than an economy meal served on china. I had to ask for bread as this wasn't offered. Taste wise it was bland, and small in portion and I am unsure as to what purpose a tacky so called candle added to the experience. The toilets had me wondering, there were two in business class yet both were completely different designs, again both resembled what i would expect in economy. Seat was good, pretty run of the mill, IFE, dreadful choice of films & TV, no blockbuster films one would expect.

I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight.

The boarding process was done by letters and was very without issues. Onboard I was impressed with the cleanliness of the aircraft and how new it was (no more than 3-5 years old). The Audio-Video Entertainment system was amazing and I would say probably the best I've ever seen with new movies, old movies, blockbusters, etc. The food and beverage selection was great. The kids received goodie bags and everyone received sleepers, toothpaste/toothbrush and sleep mask. The flight attendants were very attentive and  smiling. The second leg, IST-OTP was great as well. Flight was operated with an A330-200 which I found odd for such a short leg. Very clean plane, relatively new and same great entertainment system. Flight time was 45 minutes but food was served as well. Return flights were great as well. OTP-IST flown on a B737-700 which did not have personal video screens but food was served and service was great. IST-MIA flown on the same B777-300ER and same great, attentive service. Turkish are still allowing two free checked bags for economy passengers.  I would say Turkish service is on par or even slightly better than Lufthansa but at a much better price. WI-FI is available for a price but didn't use it. Charging ports present for each seat.

1217,Paul Neelman,Netherlands,2018-06-08,3,"Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul./ I flew several times with THY, mostly because of their connections in Middle East and Africa. I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didn’t work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless.

The online booking system failed repeatedly from the day I booked three seats from Houston to Germany via Istanbul. I booked 8 months in advance. The flight times changed three times, no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and don't call the airline to say you agree with the changes, your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg, but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them, which would have been fine except that my son, who is 5'11"" tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position, my daughter who is 5'4"" tall, could not put her legs in the forward position! On our return trip, I tried for two days to reserve and pay over $210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process, but it ultimately failed, as well. Each time the process failed, I would log out, then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved, but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card. After a few hours I finally decided to call the Turkish Airlines desk in Houston, but because of the time difference, it was closed on Sunday and would be closed on Memorial Day Monday. I then called the Turkish Airlines phone number, +90 212 444 08 492, and the customer service rep stated that two of the seats in exit row were reserved, but were not paid for and she suggested I pay for them online. I explained I was unable to pay for them online and wanted to pay for them through her. She explained that in order for her to do that, she would have to release the seats and they might get reserved by someone else. Since that was the only way I could pay for the seats, I approved releasing the seats - and within seconds the representative said the seats were gone.

1231,C Larnoute,Canada,2018-05-17,1,"On a recent ‘round-trip’ experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didn’t move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them.

Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this won’t be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines.

As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable.

Okay, so besides legalities as far as letting me on board even though USCIS confirmed my correct paperwork and Turkish Airlines refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I was treated horrifically, both by their ground staff and corporate office. No one knew who the hell to speak to as far as how their own offices, gates, officers etc worked. I was told I would be taken to the Turkish Airlines Lounge where I would have a computer and phone I could use and gather my thoughts and help, no. I was taken from one gate to the next for several hours, then taken in by security and held there for the next several hours. I was then told I had to go to the denied office and I would be assisted there, to which no assistance was available. They literally said when I asked if they knew who I could contact, “there is a phone and computer, google your help.” I arrived at 5am, and left the airport that evening at 10:45pm after no help from Turkish Airlines. When I asked instead of being held here in Turkey if they would fly me back to South Africa they said no. I tried to ask about booking a flight to Germany where my other citizenship is, and they told me they would not let me because my end destination was in the United States. I then worked on trying to get accommodation close by, after being in the airport for a day and half, coffee shop for a day/night as I had no where to go and then finally find accommodation. Finally when gathering my paperwork, Turkish airlines then refused to even honor the ticket they denied me entrance on, so I had to find an extra $600, post $575 I had paid to get an interview with the Embassy, and accommodation costs, as a part-time student, they simply emailed me with the audacity of speaking to me like an incompetent person.

I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some don’t. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600€ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didn’t really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just don’t care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight.  These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They don’t stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They don’t even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website.

When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination.

I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight!

Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there).

Arriving at IST the business lounge, supposedly the best in the world, was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed. I wrote to Turkish and after a large exchange of emails I gave up. They insisted it was open. I was there, it was closed!! Their website is a mess, their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling.  They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half. Why should they ask me to pay half towards a bag they wrecked? This has changed my attitude towards Turkish and they are not my chosen airline any longer.

1270,E Lamijula,United States,2018-03-07,1,"Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. My nightmare started when I missed my connecting flight from Istanbul going to Dubai. I was sent from one person to another there after and subsequently had a buy a visa ($30) at the airport in other to get to their ticket counter. At the ticket counter, the guy at the booth told me I had to pay $600 penalty for missing my flight and then another $2000 for a new ticket because I bought my ticket from an agent. There was no talking to him after that as he dismissed me when I told him there was no way I could pay him $2600. With the help of a very kind gentleman at the airport, I purchased another ticket to Dubai with Air Arabia. I had to leave Ataturk airport via taxi ($60) to another airport called Sabiha to catch the flight to get to Sharjah International and then subsequently to Dubai. When I went online to check, I was told my return was valid and secured and I even called the customer service line twice and was informed that I was checked in for my return. I was able to check in online and even change my seat for the return flight. I arrived at DXB airport at 4am February 22nd morning, waited for the check in counter to open at 5:20am to check in, only to be told by the agent at the desk that I could not fly out with them. He told me that since I broke the sequence and did not pay the $2600 in Turkey, my ticket was no longer valid. He also told me that they had neither a customer service counter nor a ticket counter in Dubai so my only option was to call the same customer service that previously assured me that I was confirmed to fly back to Houston with their airline. I had to be back in Houston so I had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Emirates. I had to take a shuttle to terminal 3, bought a one way business class ticket for $5440 just to make it back to Houston.  Telling a passenger to pay $2600 for missing a connection is unconscionable.

1272,B Vernon,South Africa,2018-03-04,1,London to Istanbul. I am a frequent flyer who always travels with excess baggage up to 10 times a year internationally. As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an $80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx £120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx £230 for my extra bag. £110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200%. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified? I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much? How can one bag cost double a ticket price?

1274,Mark Tonino,Netherlands,2018-03-01,2,"Istanbul to Guangzhou. One of the nicer things about Turkish Airlines is the free possibility to reserve a flight for a couple of days before booking it. We did, because we had our 3 month old daughter with us and desperately wanted her to be able to sleep in a baby bassinet and were ready to book any airline that could offer that. After reserving the flight we contacted Turkish Airlines helpdesk on Twitter (@TK_HelpDesk) to ask if they could reserve a bassinet for us and confirmed the ticket and paid after we were assured that would not be a problem. All fell apart 40 days later when we actually got on the plane and there were no bassinet seats available and the plane looked like it was fully booked. The crew asked a couple of people of they would want to change, but all refused. Later we learned they paid extra for the seats with the bassinets. A 10 hour night flight turned into a sleepless horror story trying to keep the baby balanced on our laps for hours. The space was so limited we had no possibility to eat a thing and without any possibility for air to flow things got really sweaty. After recovery at home we contacted the complaints department and quickly learned that they were only there for empty apologies. Turkish Airlines apparently decided to start selling the seats with the bassinets and decided not to bother with any of its previous commitments, just deleted them all without message or warning. Kind of baffled I inquired a few times again but somehow this multi-billion company kept insisting that breaching the contract with their customers was business as usual for them.

My flight from Manchester to Istanbul was delayed for an hour as some of the passengers could not follow simple instructions ie. seating at their assigned seats. This caused ruckus as some of them insisted on sitting on other people's seats which I found utterly ridiculous. The staff handled this poorly and kept shouting at everyone. The seat has narrow legroom and was uncomfortable. Even though it was a 4 hour flight to Istanbul, the plane was small and does not offer much space. There is only 2 toilets for economy class passengers and with people lining up to use the bathroom and staff trying to serve meals with the trolley, it was not a nice experiencel. The staff's English proficiency has room for improvement as I could not understand much from the announcements made and at one point I was given tomato juice after asking for mango juice. The in-flight meals and entertainment are satisfactory. I was lucky as even though the first flight was delayed for an hour, I managed to continue with the second flight to Kuala Lumpur. I however was not happy about the transit as the gate for my connecting flight was really far and then I had to ride the bus which took almost half an hour to reach the plane and was left to wait in the bus with the doors open (which was not a good idea as it was cold and windy early that morning) for another 15-20 mins before we were allowed to enter the plane.

It’s a shame that Turkish Airlines use the Bidvest lounge at CPT because it’s one of those pay-to-enter places that’s stuffed with passengers gorging themselves with food. Boarding for the CPT – IST flight started an hour before take-off, which seemed excessive. The business class cabin has a utilitarian décor of shades of grey – no middle-eastern bling or graduated, coloured lighting here. The staggered 2:2:2 seating pattern affords reasonable privacy, although passengers in window seats still have to climb over their neighbour’s legs. Cabin crew use a counter at the front of the cabin to prepare the food and drink service; it’s probably best for that to be done behind the scenes. It was good to have WiFi, even if it was rather slow. The Bentley night bag, Denon noise-cancelling headphones and large-screen IFE with a touch-screen remote were impressive. So, too, was the separate menu card for ordering breakfast in advance. The food service got off to a flying start with LED candles, laying out one’s tray and then the starter options where wheeled past. In principle, one could have as much as one wanted. The meze and mushroom soup were delicious. Less good were the main courses, which were, curiously, both overcooked and barely warm. A trolley of desserts and a cheese plate restored one’s faith in the presence of the on-board chef. Wines were largely Turkish, but the cabin crew seemed clueless about them. The cabin crew in general were efficient but somewhat robotic. Announcements from the cockpit lacked the friendliness of British Airways pilots. Sleep was hindered by the over-hot cabin temperature and being woken three hours before landing for the breakfast service – at 3 a.m. But at least breakfast was a cut above the usual and a feta omelette was actually pleasant. Landing was on time and we were bussed separately to the terminal. The double-level Turkish Airlines CIP lounge is vast, offering 24/7 service, unbelievable square meterage and questionable activities to pass the time. I suspect that if anyone started playing the piano on the dais they’d be asked to desist in case it put the indoor golfers off their stroke. Frankly, it was all too much. For the second leg of IST – LHR, we were on a 777-300 with a 2:3:2 configuration in business class. Thankfully the cabin was less than a third full, so we opted out of a second breakfast and caught up with some sleep. Again, the luxury of a flat bed on a short-haul flight takes some beating.

1291,David Ellis,United Kingdom,2018-02-01,9,"At half the price for a return trip from Heathrow to Cape Town with other airlines, Turkish Airlines' business class offering was too tempting to pass by, even if there was the inconvenience of transiting via Istanbul Take-off for LHR to IST was delayed by an hour, which was a concern given that we had just 1 hr 40 minutes between the scheduled landing and take-off for the IST-CPT leg. Having the full flat-bed experience for a short-haul flight was a real luxury and Turkish Airlines win hands down for providing this. Food on board was adequate and of the standard that BA now provide in Club Europe. Wheeling a trolley around loaded with foil-topped main courses didn't seem the best way of using the sky chef on board. Landing at IST was delayed by congestion and we'd almost given up on making the next flight. Getting to the terminal was helped by the airline providing a separate bus for business class. Details of gates for transit passengers was helpfully provided on board. IST is unbelievably chaotic, even at 1:00 am, but staff were around to direct passengers, and it was then just a matter of a frantic dash to the gate. Amazingly, we arrived just in time for boarding, but there was then another wait for the bus to fill to take us to a far stand. The food service on the IST-CPT leg was astonishingly good, and the role of sky chef was much more in evidence, with individual plating up of all the courses and a trolley circulated with desserts. A breakfast menu was also offered just after boarding, which allowed us to choose as much or as little as we wanted. Even the scrambled eggs were good! Disembarkation at CPT was quick, immigration was a breeze and we collected our bags just 10 minutes after landing.

I had to phone several times (sometimes with long waits and difficult communication in English)) to reserve seats in a business class. Fully flat bed seats were comfortable but food service was disorganized. Very pleasant staff was running back and forth with individual dishes and glasses in very inefficient fashion. The major problem for us occurred in the Istanbul business class lounge. Our wait time between the flights was 10 hours, and we expected to be able to use their sleeping rooms for at least several hours. To our surprise we were informed that we are not eligible because the rule is that only customers with a wait time 3-7 hours are eligible! We pleaded to let us stay for a shortened period to no avail. After complaining to manager, we were offered an accommodation in an outside hotel (we would need to procure visa and arrange transportation). Before our departure from Canada I inquired by phone if we can reserve the sleeping space because of our long wait and was told that is on first come first served and no mention of the rule. Would we know that there was the stupid rule we would have reserved a hotel room within the airport. On our arrival in Istanbul it was of course fully booked.

However there was a snafu on this trip. I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world).

Pre takeoff had a glass of Champagne which was perfectly chilled and really enjoyed. Push back was on time. Very professional crew on board in business class. Chef came around and introduced himself and handed over the menu and later took the order for main course. Had ordered special meal AVML (Asian vegetarian meal). I was bit disappointed with the special meal as they have been serving the same food for more than a year now. Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product, catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from.

Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all.

The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight. This was a long haul business class experience on a short haul flight.

1321,Rohith Jayawardene,United Kingdom,2017-12-15,9,"Having been on a few European flights so called 'Business Class', I was looking forward to the much praised Turkish Airlines Business Class flying from London to Istanbul. Turkish use widebody on most flights to Istanbul, and I was aware that this narrow body aircraft which I was flying in was not going to be as spacious. But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey. I enjoyed this flight very much and full marks to Turkish Airlines offering a good business class product on a short haul flight.

No wonder it was voted the best business class lounge in the world by Skytrax. We were a bit deceived though, not to be able to have a suite to relax, since our layover was 30 minutes above the 7 hours permitted as per regulations! At least we were able to use the showers after 2.5 hours on a waiting list. Best shower facilities we have ever seen in an airport business class lounge! Onboard, before take-off they offer a selection of newspapers and magazines but nothing in French! Isn’t Turkish Airlines aware that Montreal is the second largest French metropolis in the world, after Paris? Just as an example, Lufthansa flies to Montreal out of Frankfurt and Munich, their safety announcements are in German, French with English subtitles. Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lot’s of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin. Normally with other airlines, they come to your seat and show you the bottle before they pour into your glass. You even have to tell them at some point to stop, because they offer constantly.

Now I am told that I can get a ""refund"" after cancellation and ""no-show"" fees are applied. This amounted to $32 euros on a $600 ticket.

It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: “Reissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didn’t see was the fine print at the bottom: “Turkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.”. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didn’t. I don’t know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered “I can’t accept this”. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day.

But more scarily was my box of medicines that I needed.

Outbound flight TK1856 from Barcelona to Istanbul left about 40 minutes delayed, and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to Moscow, which resulted in spending an entire night at the airline's lounge. I would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport, who are completely uninterested in helping you out, pretending not to speak English and watching videos on their smartphones, giggling and discussing it with each other. While at the lounge, you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than 8 hours long. So please know, if you miss your flight due to the airline's fault, you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem. That's a fact. The same situation happened to me in April, while returning from Miami to Moscow via Istanbul. The airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child, changing it only for me, therefore, I ended up paying for the completely new tickets. Overpaid around 2000 USD. And, once again, the flight left late from Miami and, therefore, we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport. We were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline.

When I arrived in Phuket on the outbound sector, I asked Thai Airways whether on my return I could book a flight with them to Phuket and through check my luggage onto Turkish Airlines, both being Star Alliance. He checked on a list and said I could as Thai have an agreement with Turkish. However, when I got to Bangkok to fly to Phuket and on to Istanbul, Thai said no I couldn’t through check in. Where the agreement failed I have no idea. So had to sit with my luggage for hours waiting for Turkish check-in to open.

Turkish Airline's website claims ""Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents."". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it's 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It's as bad a website as I've ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply. Unfortunately it didn't state a thing, was quite possibly a canned message and had vague content like ""On the other hand, if our research brings any negative result, then; the documents, which we have requested from you before, will be forwarded to our Claims department in order for assessment. We would like to thank you for your kind understanding, regarding such period, in advance."". I replied, asked what time frame, what ""period"" we're talking about here, given that the 5 days are over. I got the same canned response. I arrived 13 days ago, I received not 1 comment on my missing bag from Turkish Airlines. They ignored the problem so far. They are opaque about the process, share neither procedures nor timelines/schedules. I'm sitting in Singapore without my things and this airline just doesn't care at all. They claim to be oh-so-customer friendly - and truth is, their service in the air was good. But I sincerely hope that no one ever has to talk to them about lost baggage, because here they are terrible and fail in every customer service metric you can come up with.

1349,R Masira,United States,2017-11-08,1,"✅ Verified Review   Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use “old version” or “new version” I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of – why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesn’t have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, there’s no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern. I shudder at the thought of what lays ahead in the flight if this is the type of service they have before you even travel.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul,November 2017,,,,,,,1,no,False,Atlanta,Nairobi,Istanbul

There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to London,November 2017,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4,yes,False,Istanbul,London,

The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached  the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories, we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets, they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul, and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.

I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance.

We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged. Why were we dragged from one place to another, had to watch desperate and exhausted how their employees had heated discussions and everything was so organized badly?

You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight. All in all, very happy with the airline, their call center (which I used to reserve my seats) and would gladly fly with them again. .",Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,CLJ to SIN via IST,September 2017,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,4,yes,False,CLJ,SIN,IST

I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class.

I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldn’t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays. If they adds flights to their schedule between the time of booking and date of travel they will not offer the hotel.

A woman was changing her baby's diaper by the food service area. Flight attendant was incapable of doing something about it.

When I told the flight attendant she said 'she will let her supervisor know' but nobody came to talk to me nor offered anything else to eat.

The seat was comfortable in both the upright and lie flat position allowing me to get a decent night's sleep. The catering was a let-down and a significant deterioration from what I have experienced on previous TK flights. There were no pre meal canapés, appetizers were limited and main course was bone dry. The wine list featured the same labels as they had 12 months ago. The IFE was OK but could have used more recent releases. The FA's were slow in their service and tended to mill around the galley.

On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row (31, I believe, the second to last row) but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat - 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's.

I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FA’s, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (“Devon”). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight - plus dine on demand was apparently possible (hot snacks). Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne.

I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it.

1393,M van der Sanden,Netherlands,2017-08-22,3,"✅ Verified Review   Johannesburg to Brussels via Istanbul. Our first holiday that we flew with Turkish Airlines and probably our last. However we are satisfied about the staff on board, it's the lack of customer care that makes the final result of this review. As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more.  No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation. I bought a new Samsonite, sent my invoice to them and asked them to solve this matter, but again they answered that only repairs will be paid.  When you pay over 2500 Euros for your tickets, you have the right to expect customer service as it should be. Let's end positive about the airplane and staff. The airplane is new well cleaned and you there is a lot of entertainment to choose on your personal screen. Staf is really friendly and drinks and meals are alright.

But I have to say that what distinguishes TK from any other airline I have travelled with, and I do travel a lot for both work and leisure, is the customer service. It is absolutely exceptional. I have missed my flight with a different airline twice, because of the airport I flew out of and both times Turkish airlines saved my trip!

1402,Randal Frivold,Thailand,2017-08-11,5,"✅ Verified Review   Istanbul to Bangkok. After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to ""write me up"" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service. I was disappointed by this attitude and treatment. ",A330,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Bangkok,August 2017,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,3,yes,False,Istanbul,Bangkok,

Showing my Gold card, I was politely and promptly checked in. I was told where to find the CIP lounge. In there it felt more like a school playground with children running noisily around in circles. Obviously not the fault of Turkish Airlines. Slight delay in boarding as the aircraft came in late. No boarding announcements made (until I boarded at least) but people just moved forward. One lady called out something in barely audible Turkish language, but nothing in English. Before take-off they showed the safety briefing on drop-down screens. Those screens then remained down, just showing the Turkish Airlines logo, throughout the flight. In fact they were still down as we got off the plane in Istanbul. After take-off the Captain explained and apologised for the delay. We were served a warm cheese and tomato roll with soft and hot drinks. In fact identical to the snack when I flew from Istanbul a few days earlier. But it was welcome and tasty and perfectly adequate for 11.30 pm. Two very smiling and friendly flight attendants served us. As we flew in circles the Captain announced a change in runway meant a further 15 minutes delay. We finally landed - with the only occupant in the row in front of me in his seat fully reclined. After landing we were told we could use our electronic devices so I looked at the flight path we had flown. It was certainly convoluted!

Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue.

Flight was delayed due to weather in BKK, unfortunately they only announced the delay after everyone had gone to the gate. Flight boarded about 45 min late and the crew were not quite ready when passengers boarded as they had arrived late and seemed a bit stressed about the delay which stuck with them for most of the flight. Despite the stress they were friendly and provided a good service. Welcome drinks were served but they ran out of TK's signature lemonade, which is a bit poor. That said the flight was otherwise great, dinner was served swiftly after take off and the food was a huge improvement on the outbound flight. The steak was one of the best I have had on a flight for years. After dinner beds were made and the lights were turned off. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and this time the crew did remember to collect the breakfast orders so everything was served correctly. Despite the delay in take off we landed on time in IST. Transfer security were not quite awake when we showed up at 4 am in IST but we got through quickly and on to the excellent lounge at IST. While the lounge is excellent, by 6am is was extremely busy and seat were hard to come by. As personal electronic devices has to be gate checked for travel to the UK the gate process took about 15 minutes to get through but TK has done a fairly good job of streamlining the process, especially for business class passengers. Boarding was reasonably organised and boarding for the LHR flight was quickly completed. Flight this time was a Boeing 777 which left on time from IST. Again breakfast was quickly served. While the hot choice was limited is was tasty none the less. The cabin crew was far more relaxed on this flight and an absolute pleasure. Flight landed on time at LHR.

I made sure that I purchased the ticket with the correct code (B) since you can only upgrade on Y and B codes.

I tried to contact them through their social media sites and was told to be patient and I would receive a reply. Two weeks later I checked the status and found out that Turkish Airlines had canceled my ticket. I contacted my travel agent who found out that my upgrade had created a duplicate ticket in their system so they had just canceled everything, all without informing me.

There really isn't much of a welcome when you first arrive on board. It takes a while for you to be offered a drink and for a business class traveller, I didn't get any service really throughout the whole flight. There was on both legs of the flight a few moody staff members.  The seat itself is really good. Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board.  Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price.

Check-in at LHR was quick and efficient, priority security check provided and access to any of the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal 2 (LH, United, Singapore or Canadian or the Premium Plaza lounge which TK contracts). Boarding began a little late and started somewhat disorganised with conflicting announcements but once the gate agents got them selves sorted boarding was quick and efficient.

The cabin attendants were a bit robotic but very nice. Flight was on time in to IST and when straight to a gate. On disembarkation there was a choice for connecting flights or arrivals but it looked like they had cordoned off the connecting flight route. Turned out they wanted to see boarding passes to let you through, slightly confusing and not very intuitive.

Connecting passengers were taken to hotel room but after 10 hours when passengers arrived to airport from hotel, the plane was further delayed for 12 hours. Passengers could not go back to hotel, as hotel checked them out already. So passengers were left in hotel lobby for additional 12 hours. Wheelchair assisted passengers were left with little to no help provided.

In most aspects, the flight was outstanding. Lamentably, the only negative occurred right at the start. Check-in went quickly, and the Gold Track security line was instantaneous. I did not have much time to experience the TK lounge because the TV monitors called passengers to the gate and hour and a half before departure. Gate 208 at IST was an absolute caldron. Of course, the security checks for USA departures are extensive, and as I had been informed, my ipad needed to be gate-checked. The problem was waiting and waiting in a huge crowd in a painfully hot gate area. By the time we boarded, I was drenched in perspiration. This is a problem that must be addressed, because a flight that begins uncomfortably in the extreme has to struggle to get back into pleasant territory. Nevertheless, once we boarded, the experience was exceptional. Seating on the 777-300 is 2x3x2. Every seat was occupied, but the seats themselves were full recline and provided adequate room. It almost goes without saying that the DO & CO food onboard was plentiful and delicious. TK provides a dining experience comparable to that of a fine restaurant. Cabin service was outstanding, and passengers who wanted to work or surf were provided with a laptop. The various quirks of the laptop took some time to decipher, but in the end, this provided several hours of amusement. There was a huge selection of movies, music, games, and TV shows.

Contrary to my expectations, everything from check-in through to landing was in perfect order. Flight pulled from the gate slightly behind schedule but landed early. On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep.

1434,T. Eldem,Canada,2017-06-15,1,"✅ Verified Review   Montreal to Istanbul on TK36. Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out check-in had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day, there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a one-day delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do. If TK is well and truly aspiring to become one of the leading carriers, they need to significantly pick up their game in customer relations and response to unforeseen events.",A330,Business,Business Class,Montreal to Istanbul,June 2017,,,,,1.0,,1,no,False,Montreal,Istanbul,

My originating United Airlines flight from Tampa was cancelled at the last minute, and after much scrambling, I arrived at the Turkish counter at JFK only 50 minutes before scheduled departure to IST. The flight had just closed, but the Turkish staff took pity on me and checked me in anyway. Both flights (New York JFK to Istanbul and Istanbul to Madrid) departed and arrived punctually.

But, their response to the issue was the worst and most customer unfriendly service I have ever had from any provider or any service, and has remained so for weeks. No ability to raise the issue by email, and online service down. No-one seeming to read anything submitted, in favour of moving it to another department as fast as possible and not just once, but time and time again. Asking for image of my passport (that they didn't need), over an online submission form that is insecure, in breach of their own privacy policy and all passably acceptable practice;  ignoring the claim made and it would appear all text entered on their system; saying a bag whose main zip was broken to the point of not being able to shut anymore 'does not constitute any impediment for use of the baggage'; and not seeming to have a central complaint team.

Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown.

Almost every member constantly dropped something: our food, their own food, once they managed to drop a pasta portion twice. I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective.

1450,A Benado,Panama,2017-04-26,8,"✅ Verified Review   Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul. The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I've witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the ""angled flat"" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you'll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won't come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I'm more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I'd fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation.

However the ground staff in Istanbul is quite outstanding and efficient!

In both cases, the first flight was late, giving us barely 30 mins to catch the next flight whose gate was really far away. The connecting flight was also Turkish Airlines, but still there was no support at the airport even though their first flight was late. While coming back from Mumbai, at Istanbul, there was an additional security check and the queue was long and our flight was in 15 mins! Nobody gave us any support there either and by some luck, one of the fellow passengers in the same situation was told by people waiting with us that we can go to priority security check if the flight is leaving soon. There was no sign for this or any indication from either Turkish Airlines or airport staff. We barely made it to the next flight 2 mins before gate closed even though the aircraft didn't take off for next 30 mins or more.

Good service once again with the regular drinks service, delicious meal of roasted meat and a very friendly bunch of flight attendants The entertainment system on board the A320 winglets was better than my outgoing flights, with a better touchscreen interface. Departure from Istanbul-Singapore also on-time, with a new A333 that had the newest entertainment system on board (it has live news from BBC and CNN). Good meal service once again with a relish pasta rigatoni, although I wish they didn't run out of meal choices on board.

1474,S Andrews,Netherlands,2017-03-06,4,"✅ Verified Review   I had to get from Amsterdam to Antalya, and in winter time Turkish Airlines seemed to be the only decent option with a daily service. The flight was via SAW, the other airport in Istanbul. AMS-SAW was uneventful and not memorable, except the aircraft was an old A320 with a worn and not very clean cabin. No entertainment system, food offer was decent, but rather below average for an almost 4hr flight, flight attendants busy about themselves. Everything has indicated that the flights from and to SAW is a very low priority for Turkish Airlines. The scheduled transfer time in SAW was 1 hour, however the crowd at the passport control was far too huge to manage this within the time indicated in the reservation. I approached employees of Turkish Airlines and informed them about possible problems with my connection to AYT, and they could not help but tell me that yes, indeed there is no way to pass through the passport control except waiting in the line, then another employee put me on a fast track line, and then another one kicked me out of there explaining that I was not entitled to it. Most of the Turkish Airlines transfer staff also could not speak any English, and those who could had a lot of problems with this. At the end, it took me over 1 hr 30 min to pass through passport control, and I was rebooked to the next flight departing from SAW at 00.10 am instead of initially planned 8.05 pm. On the transfer desk they also gave me a voucher for a meal in McDonalds, the voucher could be redeemed only for the cheapest burger menu worth c.a. EUR 4.5. Needless to say, that is below anything that can be expected from a major air carrier, and I went to another place to get my meal on my own. No free internet in SAW, and the procedure for getting the paid one is crazily complicated. The flight from SAW to AYT was uneventful too, a brand-new B737-800 with a great entertainment system and a good sandwich; all that looked a bit unnecessary on this 50 min flight. On my way backed I changed in IST, the main airport in Istanbul. Both flights were quite the same as on my way from AMS, except that the aircraft of the IST-AMS was a B737-800 with a good entertainment system, in contrast to the entertainment system, the cabin looked quite worn, with the cracks on plastic details. The food offer is the same “a bit below average” menu as on the AMS-SAW flight. Summing up, the Turkish can be OK for point-to-point connections, but I would avoid transfer flights with them. SAW cannot handle transfers in a decent manner, due to apparent infrastructural, organisational and human capacity constraints. IST is slightly better, but it is very crowded, not very clean, poorly organised and has very confusing navigation, I had no contacts with transfer staff there, but got a few hints that the expectation should be high. There is no free internet in both airports, and the paid access is quite challenging to configure and get through. The voucher for the cheapest McDonalds meal in SAW was the final touch in the ungraceful picture of transfers in IST and SAW.

Never showed their tiredness during those long flights. The pilots did the best job from every take-off to every landing. The price of the tickets was perfect. The meals were so nice. Just the seats in economy class weren't so comfortable for such a long-haul trip, so next time business class for more comfort.

1487,G Sherwood,Tajikistan,2017-02-06,1,"✅ Verified Review   Dushanbe to Istanbul. I will never fly Turkish Airlines again. I was scheduled to depart early on Saturday morning. However, due to snow Turkish Airlines decided not to send the plane from Istanbul to Dushanbe. Despite the fact that FlyDubai and Somon Air both managed to get their flights in and out. If that were not bad enough the next time they said they would be flying was 2 days later on Monday.  But it is now Monday and they have had the better part of two days to deal with the snow and the weather is crystal clear in Dushanbe. But is the flight coming on time? No. It is delayed 5.5 hours, assuming it arrives at all. That has destroyed the rest of my itinerary. I am going to have to spend the night in Istanbul as a result in the best case scenario. This is not the first time Turkish has screwed up my travel. Because where I live Turkish is one of a handful of airlines that come in and out, I have used them from time to time, but it will certainly be the last.

Arrived in Kiev 25 mins late, so missed my connection to my destination. Turkish Airlines said it was due to a passenger not arriving for their flight, so the flight from Istanbul to Kiev was delayed. Got to Kiev and my suitcase wheel has been smashed, new suitcase and good quality. Turkish Airlines refuse to take responsibility, complaint made. On return journey I arrived a the airport in Kiev 5 mins late due to severe weather condition in the area of Ukrainian where I staying. Turkish Airlines refused to all allow me on board and then tried to charge me $500 dollars for a return flight plus a penalty charge of 100 Euros because I was late. I later found out that I was actually bumped of the flight because it was over subscribed so the real reason I was not allowed on the plane, was because they had already sold my seat.

1491,S Pandati,Singapore,2017-01-28,1,"✅ Verified Review   Turkish Airlines offloaded me 50 minutes before takeoff despite having checked-in online. They didn't issue a boarding pass, but sent a check-in acknowledgement with seat and flight details. When I went to get a print of my boarding pass, the lady at the airline counter said boarding had closed an hour in advance. I was traveling only with a small cabin luggage, but Turkish Airlines staff insisted that they were offloading checked baggage because the aircraft was overloaded. I haven't seen boarding gates at Changi Airport close 30 minutes before takeoff, and in my experience of flying I have never been offloaded before. A 10-minute delay due of dearth of cabs on the eve of Chinese New Year left me with big losses (promotional non-refundable fare + onward flights).

1492,B Dowe,Colombia,2017-01-23,9,"✅ Verified Review   Bogota to Rome via Istanbul. We booked the tickets back in early October 2016 for the 5 of us, as part of our once-a-year-trip to Germany. The offers with LH for the direct flight BOG-FRA were not interesting at all. Being a Star Gold Card holder I preferred to travel with a Star Alliance partner, and knowing that TK started to serve BOG in May 2016, I looked for this option, but prices to any German destination were still rather high, so for pure curiosity I went searching the prices for other European destinations. Rome with a very attractive price was the hit, so we decided to fly TK via IST to Italy, staying one night in IST and one night in Rome, before heading on to FRA with a very cheap Alitalia ticket. Bogota to Istanbul has a stop-over in Panama City, and the same flight number back to BOG from IST. So when boarding the plane in BOG we found many passengers originating in Istanbul with Panama as their destination. So the plane was packed on the short flight to Panama, with many passenger leaving the plane in PTY, but not too many passengers boarding to fly to Istanbul. This meant that my wife and myself had a row of 2 seats for ourselves on the way over during this long 13h flight. The service offered by crew was faultless, the food was very good and nicely presented, I would say the best I had in Economy so far. The crew was attentive and willing to help in any case. During the long flight my wife flew into her birthday, and I asked if they can do anything for her. They smiled and promised to arrange a surprise. 20 minutes later they came along with the on-board chef, presenting a cake, nicely prepared with candles and cream saying happy birthday, champagne from Business Class for both of us, and singing happy birthday to her! The plane arrived on time in IST, and we went on the City tour Turkish Airlines offers to their international transfer passengers. This tour is free and takes you to the most important tourist sites in Istanbul, and includes a nice lunch. After the tour ended, the guide stayed in the city with those who were not in a hurry, like us, and took us around some more places.  Next morning flight to Rome, with a nicely presented and filling breakfast, better than most Intra-European business class meals on other airlines. Trip back to Colombia in January the same quality on all flights, I was a bit concerned about our luggage due to some comments here about lost baggage, but all arrived safely in BOG. During the 6h layover at Atatürk airport we used the Turkish Airlines lounge. A huge place, nicely decorated, with great F&B options, nice showers and some other gimmicks like electronic driving range, pool table, etc - a very good place to easily spend the time and get a nice rest before the very long flight back to BOG. That flight was totally packed, nevertheless the crew again offered a great service. I cannot complain about lack of friendliness and professionalism. Saying that, however, we were lucky enough to travel back to BOG a week after the snow chaos at Atatürk airport. Things probably would have been different for us if we had travelled some days earlier.

1493,A Maris,Canada,2017-01-22,3,"✅ Verified Review   Toronto to Istanbul. I have recently flown via Turkish Airlines and it was not pleasant experience compare to previous years. I could only say that this North America flight has gone downhill in last few years. The plane seemed aged, seats were not comfy, narrow for 10 hours flight. It could be my luck getting an older plane, and it could be different with newer planes for the same route.  Check-in to the flight was a complete mess. Instead of calling with zones or Tier everyone invited to open counters, and it caused huge line ups and mess in the plane. Cabin staff was nice, courteous but not helpful. They lied about foods to people especially who were not a native speaker of Turkish.  They passed, drinks and food items over passengers heads to their colleague if they were out on their carts. I felt extremely warm in my seat. Complained about it and the answer was this is the coldest they can get at this altitude for maximum air quality in the cabin. The final part is that 2 of my luggage get lost on this flight, Turkish Airlines cannot locate my luggage, and each representative over the phone tells different location. We are now getting into 72 hours, but no one knows where my luggage is. ",Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Istanbul,January 2017,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,False,Toronto,Istanbul,

Meal service is a bit slow, as reasonable attention is given to passengers when attendants ask for meal and drink choices. Transit at Istanbul is organized, with the IST to NRT leg a very pleasant experience. On return, lines at NRT were really long due to previous flight the cancellations in IST.

1496,B Thomson,Poland,2017-01-18,9,"✅ Verified Review   As I had a transfer of 11 hours in Istanbul, I was given a 4* hotel near the airport for free which was a real surprise! I was very relaxed before the flight. However, the ground service is not well-organized nor polite. It took me 2 hours to get to know of the free hotel option. Anyway, the boarding was fine, I liked the hot refreshing towel, the cosmetic kit with slippers and socks, the blanket and pillow. The tablet had good resolution so I enjoyed a movie. The catering was great (as always), so were the beverages. We arrived with a 1 hour delay. Apart from long queues at the passport control, which is not the fault of Turkish Airlines, I had to wait another hour for my luggage, which is the airline's handling agency fault. There were suitcases from 3 wide-body jets on just one belt at the same time. The overall experience was very good.

1498,M Henderson,United States,2017-01-17,1,"✅ Verified Review   Turkish Airlines is nice when everything goes right. However, if something goes wrong they are really terrible. Case in point, I recently flew from Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. Both flights were delayed by an hour. The onboard service was very good on both legs. Onboard the service is of a higher quality than that of US airlines. However, when we arrived into Dubai, all 3 of our bags were missing. Since both flights were delayed over an hour, there was plenty of time to transfer the bags. However, our bags didn't make it and apparently, neither did the bags of some other passengers who originated from Houston. Believe it or not, after a long flight from Houston to Istanbul, upon arrival you do not arrive at a jetway. You arrive at remote parking and have to take a bus to the terminal. This also has an impact on baggage and for this reason alone, I would not recommend Turkish. The resolution of the baggage has been awful. The only way to communicate with TK is via twitter. 2 of our bags have been found but one seems to be completely gone. In this age of barcode bagtags, I just do not see how this happens. I can't recommend anyone take Turkish Airlines based on my experience. They are horrible when anything goes awry.

The departure was on time,  aircraft was new (with sky interior lightning) and very clean. There weren't too many passengers. Therefore, there was a free middle seat between me and the other passenger. The seat pitch was fine. In the beginning, I got a chocolate praline. Then we got earbuds (bad quality and shallow sound but it is economy so I am not going to complain) and I managed to watch a full movie during the flight (the screen was pretty large and had good resolution). The food on this short-haul flight was tasty and it included a hot meal (which is rare on European flights) and a complimentary beverage (I recommend Ayran yoghurt and homemade lemonade but you can also take alcoholic drinks). The flight attendants offered tea and coffee. The flight attendants provided top notch service.
