11,Patrick Stohr,Germany,2023-10-12,10,"Before flight experience, I used Lufthansa's Business Lounge in B44, which was a great way to start my 5hrs segment to Baku. Food options are great, considering that one doesn't need to wait for food preparation, it will be refilled always. What I love about the food in the lounge is that they serve an indian dish such as Aloo Dum frequently and I really adore the taste! Also, the showers are cleaned well, very good facility to freshen up and they provide L'Occitane products in the lounge. Boarding from an Apron position and passengers had to wait inside the bus for about 10 mins, before pax could enter the aircraft. Aircraft seat was clean and the crew was fantastic, doing their jobs with dedicated and hard-working engagement to serve C pax well throughout the entire flights - with 12 rows in C on this flight. I felt really comfortable. Even though it was a 5hrs flight on a narrowbody A321 on that route, because of the service and the silence in the C cabin, I enjoyed my experience. I am not a fan of Tasting Heimat, but thats a matter of personal taste. Thus, I pre-ordered an Indian special meal ahead of the flight and it tasted great! Priority Luggage came among the very first luggage pieces on the carousel. Very happy with this. Con's: Wifi and lack of power outlets.

15,Elchin Rahbarli,Germany,2023-10-06,1,"Already problems at the counter with checking in the baggage. Lufthansa installs new baggage processing equipment every 3-5 years for whatever reason. The new system scanned our boarding card and did not print the baggage ticket for us to be able to check in the luggage. Then we went to the counter to perform the same process manually. Guess what the new baggage processing machine got stuck this time and was not able to process the luggage. Had to wait 20 mins for someone to come and manually solve the problem.  Nevertheless, we thought that should be it we can fly and not worry about the luggage but it was too soon for us to calm down. We land at the destination and our luggage is not there. So, if you have problem with this new ""automatic"" baggage submission process which in turn results in manual problem solution and baggage delay till at least the next flight.

27,N Mayre,United States,2023-09-26,6,"I like Lufthansa. They are a little cheaper than United on the same route and most of the time they are on time. The food and service is mechanical but efficient. I was excited to get a first look at Boeing 747-8 and thought seating on the double Decker would be fun! Alas! Who knew seating 'higher up' does not mean elevated experience. The business class seats at the upper deck are similar to down below, except it's 2-2 instead of 2-2-2 due to narrower space. The design of this business class (including lower deck) works for a couple but for people flying in business, does not make much sense. There are ample of holes if you are seating on the window seats but none for the passenger seating in the aisle seats. The seat was ok, it reclined fully and did it's job. I may have gotten a few hours sleep. The worst part was the screen and video. The touch screen barely worked.

31,A Danovich,United States,2023-09-22,1,"My experience with economy class seating comfort on the recent flight has been completely appalling. I have submitted my feedback to Lufthansa, and for this I have received a copy-pasted template response that have denied my request to compensation when I have not made or implied this request any at any point. Lufthansa made it clear that the comfort experience was as-intended by the company. The crux of the issue was lack of upper body ergonomics in the seats - while there was decent legroom provided, there was no way to rest my upper body without disturbing the passengers next to me, no matter how I tried to contort and what sitting poses I would pick. At its root, there is just not enough space between you and the forward seat ahead when it is reclined (which it will be on a long transatlantic flight!), the arm rests were useless, the angles between your body and seats/walls were uncomfortable, and the seating surface was just a bit too short.  Additionally, the in-flight entertainment gets a low rating due to brightness issue compounded by lack of space - if the IFE screen is off, any time you try to move in your seat you will bump against it... at which point the screen comes back on at default brightness. This means it'll shine bright in your face and disturb people around you many-many times over on a dark flight. The default brightness is extremely bright for a dark flight condition when everyone is trying to sleep, and there seemed to be no way to make the IFE remember the brightness level. I did not use IFE for its intended entertainment purpose, so I cannot rate the media contents. The second short flight using A321neo was just OK. It provided the basic level of comfort, but was nothing to write home about. The other aspects of my flight were not notable in the context of just how very uncomfortable the seating was.",A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Munich,September 2023,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2,no,True,San Francisco,Munich,,Positive,0.9428,  experience economy class seating comfort recent completely appal submit feedback receive template response deny request compensation make implied request point make clear comfort experience company crux issue lack upper body ergonomics seats decent legroom provide way rest upper body without disturb passenger next matter try contort sit pose pick root enough space forward seat ahead recline long transatlantic arm rest useless angle body uncomfortable seat surface bit short additionally entertainment get low rating due brightness issue compound lack space ife screen time try move seat bump point screen come back default brightness mean shine bright face disturb people around time dark default brightness extremely bright dark condition everyone try sleep seem way make ife remember brightness level use ife intend entertainment purpose rate medium content second short use a321neo ok provide basic level comfort nothing write home aspect notable context uncomfortable seating
32,L Kalasek,United States,2023-09-21,1,"I had an unpleasant experience while on board a Lufthansa flight from KTW to San Francisco via Frankfurt. On my flight to Frankfurt, first I witnessed a flight attendant loudly screaming at another employee before boarding.  Once on the plane, the same flight attendant yelled at passengers to not bring their bags on board, instead insisting they leave their carry-ons at the foot of the airstairs. I understand the issue, but I didn’t know how it all works, and I was connecting in Frankfurt, I politely asked the FA, if I could please keep my only one bag pack with me since my connection was tight. She raised her voice and yelled that everyone here has a connection and walked off. Very rude and unprofessional. My arrival gate was in the B concourse and my connection was in Z. It would have been very difficult to wait for my bag with such a long distance to travel within Frankfurt Airport. Fortunately, another passenger told me we could get our bags while leaving the plane, before boarding the terminal bus. It's a shame it took a fellow passenger to explain things to me and deal with my concerns. The FA on the other hand, was rude, unprofessional, and from my point of view, on a power trip. I told her this as I was disembarking the aircraft and felt worried, she would have removed me from the flight had I asked more questions. Customer service is something that she is definitely lacking. Instead of dealing with a legitimate passenger concern, she pulled a power trip on me without any explanation directing people is not acceptable.

35,M Thompson,Canada,2023-09-16,3,"Last time I travelled was in 2020, I understand prices went up but!! I paid 2000$ and it was the worst flight I’ve ever been on, even the service was less than mediocre. I’ll start with the delays: all of my 4 flights were delayed by 1h30min to 2h because of some lame excuse: plane not here yet, another plane blocking us, cleaning the aircraft. I was exhausted before starting my 7h flight and they overbooked, so they started asking passengers to give up their seats and take another flight with a different airline (of course paid and everything but still). Now Cabin Staff service: I am short, therefore I cannot reach the cubbies on top to put my luggage and that’s why I didn’t have a carry on since I was traveling alone. They made me put my small purse in the cubbie which is fine for safety reasons. When I was allowed to take it back, I got up to reach it, but I couldn’t. Everyone looked at me while I was jumping trying to open it and when I asked for help, the hostess rudely said: “I’m not tall either” and told me to wait. I sat down and waited for an hour, no one showed up to help. My anxiety was getting worse, I needed to disinfect my table and screen before they served food and beverages. I awkwardly asked the guy next to me to help me get my purse and I’m thankful for him. Now entertainment: There was nothing interesting to watch. Thank God they had wifi so I paid for it and watched on my phone the entire flight. Food: It was ok. I’m not that picky. Long story short, I don’t recommend Lufthansa for long flights, maybe a flight up to 3h maximum. They are not well organized, it vey poorly managed, everything was chaotic and uncomfortable.

41,S Dayne,United Kingdom,2023-09-02,7,"I have given a decent score despite landing in Frankfurt 5 hours later than intended, because the airline reacted quickly to circumstances beyond its control (poor weather) by rebooking me immediately on to an alternative Lufthansa flight of my choosing. I was originally booked to fly from London City Airport to Frankfurt on the mid-morning flight but the inbound aircraft could not land due to dense fog at that time and the aircraft was eventually diverted to Gatwick after several go-arounds, so my flight as cancelled at the very last minute (when all passengers were waiting at the gate to board). There appeared to be only 2 Lufthansa ground staff at London City airport managing this flight and the senior member was unfriendly (she was borderline rude to some passengers who were understandably worried about delays leading to missed connections in Frankfurt) but her colleague was much more sympathetic. I bypassed them both in the end by reaching out to Lufthansa using their web chat on my phone internet whilst still at the airport gate, and was rebooked on to a later flight from London Heathrow airport, though the web agent had to wait for the Lufthansa computer system to “officially” recognise that my original flight had indeed been cancelled (which took a few minutes). I was then rebooked and checked-in automatically and my new boarding pass emailed to me immediately. I appreciated that I had automatically been allocated an aisle seat on my new flight, as I had paid for an aisle seat for my original flight. So basically the web chat agent had been very helpful. After that I was reliant on the Lufthansa ground staff to walk us (all affected passengers) back to “land-side” from “airside” of the airport. Luckily I did not have check-in luggage to wait to collect, so I immediately travelled across London (at my own expense) using public transport from City airport to Heathrow airport for the early afternoon flight to Frankfurt. This was a totally full flight due to accommodating others who had missed the City flight like me. Boarding for this flight was by zones, and I saw some people’s cabin luggage (those with carry-on cases) being weighed at the gate itself to check for compliance with the 8kg limit. This flight took off half an hour late (not unusual for any Heathrow flight, of any airline). We received one small bottle of water and chocolates for free.

If you enjoy stress, frustration, and zero accountability, then, by all means, book your tickets with them. If not, run in the opposite direction! Let's start with the baggage debacle. Yes, Lufthansa lost not one, not two, but FOUR of my bags! They're trying to prove they're the masters of mishandling luggage. And the cherry on top? Their communication was a joke. I felt like I was playing a guessing game with my own belongings. But the real kicker? When I reached out for compensation, they dared to respond with, ""According to our record, the baggage irregularity happened at your home airport. Please understand that we cannot comply with your compensation request under these circumstances."" Seriously? So not only did they lose my bags, but they also refused to take responsibility for their mistake! Now, let's talk about customer service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to deal with unhelpful, indifferent, and unresponsive staff, Lufthansa has you covered. They've taken a crash course in making customers feel like a burden. Oh, and the fun doesn't stop there. Last year, I had the ""pleasure"" of going through the same ordeal with Lufthansa's baggage mishandling.

51,G Ganapathy,United States,2023-08-28,2,"We understand that experiencing delayed baggage can be frustrating, and it seems like the handling of the situation by Lufthansa in Saint Louis has been quite challenging.

I want to highlight that this review pertains specifically to their call center and counter customer service, not their in-flight service.  When attempting to purchase two tickets on their website, the site froze upon clicking ""purchase."" No success page was displayed. In response, I promptly called the airline to clarify the situation. They assured me that no flights had been booked. Successful Booking on Expedia: To secure our travel, we successfully purchased the tickets through Expedia. Unexpected Charge:  a week later, an unexplained charge of $3500 appeared on our credit card from the initial unsuccessful Lufthansa booking.  Contacting Lufthansa, I was informed that it was too late to cancel the flight. Despite our numerous attempts to resolve the issue, the customer service representatives seemed uninterested in assisting, consistently deflecting responsibility. We sought resolution through Amex, but our efforts were futile due to a lack of proof for the original call.  Upon arrival at the airport, we encountered further frustration. Lufthansa's representatives continued evading responsibility, resulting in no resolution.  Ultimately, my wife and I were left traveling with four seats, a predicament that was entirely avoidable.

62,D Herejt,Netherlands,2023-08-22,1,"It has been more than 6 months since Lufthansa canceled my flight. They provided us with an incorrect email address to claim our refund for the canceled flight and any additional costs incurred due to the cancellation. When I emailed them with all my bills for the hotel, restaurant, and taxi expenses, I received a response stating that they had discontinued this method and provided other instructions for claiming my refund. Unsure of how to proceed and having received no response to my initial ticket, I attempted all the options described in the email. Unfortunately, nothing happened for about a month. I then searched for the customer support line number and called them, only to find out that instead of asking for a refund, you need to provide feedback in Lufthansa's process. After a little over two months, I finally learned how to request a refund. Things seemed positive as they requested information, and I provided everything they needed. Following that, they requested my bank details for registration, but since then, I've received no response. I contacted customer support, was told to wait since it hadn't been three months yet, and so I did. Now, over 6 months since my flight, I still haven't received any information about when I'll get the refund. I know the amount I'm supposed to receive, but it seems they're doing everything to avoid paying it. Today marked my last call to the call center. I had called last week, and they were supposed to contact the refund department to address my case. By the way, contacting this department is only possible via email, not through customer support or yourself. Regardless, I got a bit angry today because I haven't received anything, not even an email saying they're working on it. And all I get from team leader is a statement that I can't do anything but wait. They sent an email a week ago, and that's it — call canceled. When I called again, they asked me to speak with him, but he only sent a message that there's nothing to discuss. I requested an audio recording from agent, but I was sent to the same department where I've been waiting for a refund for half a year.

While my baggage was already en route to Philadelphia, I was advised to contact an online chat assistant for help. I learned that my original flight was rescheduled from 8 am to 11 am. This change meant I'd have just an hour to make my connecting flight from Frankfurt to Philadelphia.  Although tight on time, our flight from Munich was delayed by 35 minutes.

Sprinting through the airport, I was disheartened to discover another unexpected check-in process in Frankfurt. When I completed it, I presumed my flight to Philadelphia had departed without me. To my relief, but also frustration, the flight was delayed until 2 pm, presumably to accommodate other passengers like myself. Upon finally landing in Philadelphia my baggage was nowhere to be found.

Once arriving it would take 24 hours to be cleared by customs, keep checking the website. I asked twice if someone could phone us, which never happened. The website is absolutely useless. It says ""we are working hard to locate your bag"". Then it says it has been found and a courier would be allocated but there could be delays. We were not at all confident that our bags would get to us before our flight out of Berlin so we changed our delivery address from our hotel in Berlin to our home address. Surprise, surprise 1 bag had been delivered to the hotel, with a damaged handle, on the morning we checked out, 11 August, even though we received an email saying the bag was with the courier and would be delivered on 14 August. Arrived at airport and went to the lost luggage section. To our astonishment we were actually able to locate the second bag. Lufthansa used to be a reputable airline but we would not give it 1 star.

79,Mohamed ElHarery,Canada,2023-08-07,1,"The worst airline company in the world. I was on board flights LH 587 and LH 474 on 07/25/2023. The company did not load and deliver the bags for the entire flight from Munich Airport to Montreal Airport and all what they did was an apology “ SORRY TECHNICAL MISTAKE”. A report of the loss of the bag was made at Montreal Airport on 25/7. They disable the baggage tracking service from my account on their systems by 7/31, so I am not able to know the status of the bag at all. I called them on 7/27, 7/30, 1/8, and 7/8, and every time they give me a response opposite to the other response. Sometimes they say that the delivery of the bag has been confirmed by the courier and you received it, another call the bag is on the way by courier, and the last call was very funny as they say the bag arrived at Montreal airport, but the delivery status is unknown on the system. My city is very far from Montreal airport is about 952 Km driving by car or 1:20 hour by airplane, so I asked them to share any contact such as email or phone number for Lufthansa Montreal office so I can communicate and check with my bag, but the call center says we don’t have any contact for Montreal airport.

Went to the airport with 3 pieces, to be met by quite an incompetent staff working for Lufthansa telling me it's a website mistake, you only have two pieces of luggage not 4, so it is your responsibility to pay for the 3rd piece or we don't accept the luggage. Pointless argument for next 45 minutes, with all sort of excuses, none of which answers the most basic question, if we even accept that your website is wrong for the most basic information, why is that something that I should fix rather than the airline, the answer is simply from Lufthansa ""pay now & dispute with your credit card company"", I never heard this even from low cost charter airlines which to be fair they actually have better customer than the non existing customer service of Lufthansa. I paid $100 dollars for the luggage. Eventually on arrival they say sorry we only put 2 out of 3 luggage on the flight, 6 days & no luggage & no nothing.

The plane was delayed in New York JFK for a little over 2 hours. When we arrived in Munich, we were first told that we have to be rebooked because we won't make our connection. Then just before landing, we were told that we will make our connection but we have to run to the new gate. One of the flight attendants was asking us what time does the cruise ship depart from Athens? Just before landing in Athens Airport, they announced over the intercom that none of our luggage was on the plane and that we should go to the luggage help desk in Athens and file a report for missing luggage. Now I understood why they asked the question about the departure of our cruise ship. When I spoke to the flight attendant about that, she said it was not their decision, but that it was ""ground operation"" that decided not to wait for the luggage so they don't miss the flight window. Instead they decided to inconvenience over 50 people, including 7 in my family who are going on a cruise without a hair brush, a pair of underwear or an article of clothing. We were on line for over 2 hours at the luggage desk to fill the forms of missing luggage. It was a nightmare trying to function on the cruise or enjoying any activities without any of our belongings. Six days later we received our luggage in Cyprus. The largest airline in Europe should be embarrassed by such callousness of their employees in Munich. We spent most of our time buying clothes and personal effects instead of enjoying the activities on the cruise ship.

86,Suheer Drwesh,United Arab Emirates,2023-07-29,1,"My flight was delayed for more than three hours, causing significant inconvenience and wasted time. The process of reaching a real person in customer support was also challenging, as I had to wait with the number 87 in the queue. When I finally connected with an agent, they abruptly closed the chat without addressing my concerns, adding to my frustration. The seat allocation debacle was a major embarrassment. Upon check-in, I was assigned a specific seat, but upon reaching the aircraft, I was given a completely different seat. Worse yet, another passenger claimed the same seat, leading to an awkward situation. This confusion was eventually resolved, but not without causing unnecessary anxiety. The most distressing part of my journey was the mishandling of my luggage. Due to the flight delay, my luggage missed the connecting flight, and I was forced to fill out a form to provide details about my belongings. The subsequent emails I received from Lufthansa were inconsistent and misleading. First, I was informed that my luggage was found and would be delivered, but the next day, I received another email stating that you still couldn't locate my delayed baggage. I am deeply dissatisfied with the reimbursement policy for essential items like clothing and personal items.

Lufthansa shows in the app that I can get a refund straight away. I wasn't offered a different flight. I had to call the Customer Service. I was given no explanation why the flight was cancelled. The customer service was bad. I could not hear them despite the fact that I asked several times to speak up. My original flight was at 06:55, I was offered only late flights. 4 options were given via Brussels, Zurich, Frankfurt and one more which I can't remember. I chose the Zurich one as this one was the earliest one almost them all - operated by the Swiss. Upon arriving at Heathrow, everything seemed to be in order, one hour into waiting for my flight I got a message that the flight has been delayed. Immediately I went to Lufthansa's desk to check if I won't miss my Zurich - Berlin flight. I was told: don't worry Zurich-Berlin is late too and Zurich will deal with you, but this is not our problem here. 1.5 hours later we took off from Heathrow. Just before landing, we were advised by a Swiss crew what gates should we go to - connecting flights - once reaching the gate I saw on the screen Boarding. A few moments later they announced that the flight was cancelled and all passengers should go to Transit Desk. Once arrived there - a massive queue was there. Whilst waiting in the queue I called Lufthansa, once again unable to hear them, even though I asked to speak up, I was told no help will be given as I am already at the airport.

100,Pamela Hagen,United States,2023-07-10,1,"My flight to a Frankfurt connection was diverted to Dusseldorf because the Frankfurt airport closed due to a drone & security. The pilot said we were refuelling. Everyone thought the plane would then return to Frankfurt. Instead, without any direction, we were told to exit the plane. We had no idea what was going on, eventually ending up in baggage collection. Half an hour later, a staff member showed up & said we should collect our luggage & would be driven back to Frankfurt on buses. This took 5 hours. By then, everyone had missed their onward flights. No one met us as 5 huge bus loads of passengers exited at Frankfurt. Again, no one knew where to go. Eventually, everyone found their way to Lufthansa Rebooking. I stood in line 3 hours.  At this point no one had been offered water or food. After at least an hour in line, some snacks & water showed up, the first & only customer consideration. The agent who waited on me did not have a clue what she was doing. She wanted to book me on a flight to Chicago, long layover, then PHL. I said I wanted to be booked on the same non-stop flight to PHL. After an hour, she rebooked me for that flight leaving 3 days later, gave me a voucher for the night, & said I had to come back to the airport the next day to get a voucher for the following night. The hotel was a 20 min. shuttle bus drive. Next morning, I left the hotel on the return shuttle bus early in order to get back by the last shuttle bus at 10:50 or wait for next one at 16:20. I had to wait in line again in the Rebooking line another 2 hours to get another voucher. The agent went into my ticketing & said she had to go upstairs to documentation because of a problem with the previous rebooking. Apparently I had been rebooked via Chicago one day & a second booking direct to PHL 3 days later. When she returned, she handed me to another agent. He rebooked me on a direct flight to PHL with EW Discovery but one day later not 2 days later. He gave me a voucher for a different hotel & complicated directions to taking the train there. I said my luggage was at the previous hotel I was sent to yesterday. He said he didn’t know anything about yesterday. He was very rude & condescending. By the time I was finished with these 2 people, I had missed my shuttle which meant I could not repack my luggage & checkout by noon. I called the hotel & had no choice but to book another night there which I had to pay for out of pocket.  When my rebooking confirmations came through, I received 2 for check-in: One for the next day, the other for the following day, same flights. I checked in to the flight for the following day. The plane did take off the next day, & I was on it. But EW Discovery economy was the tightest seating I have ever been in.  Needless to say, had I known I’d be booked in a sardine can on a partner airline I never heard of for $2200, I would never have booked Lufthansa. And because of the worst customer service ever & uncomfortable partner airline, I never will again.

The plane left Toulouse over an hour late, which made us miss the flight from Munich to Montreal. We had to wait 4h in line to get the tickets for the hotel/cab + plane tickets for the next available flight (24h later) to Montreal. The next day we got into the plane, the plane was nasty. I tried putting my bottle of water in the compartment in front of my seat and as I reached to put it I touched used, humid Kleenex from the previous passengers. I was about to take a picture of it when the stewardess saw me and changed our seats. The new seats we’re as nasty as the previous one, coffee stains on the table, visible old journals in the compartment, hairs on the other table, etc. That was at the time when Airlines companies were supposed to clean the planes very well in between flights (for obvious COVID reasons), we we’re also still required to wear a mask at all times. Two days after my arrival, I wrote a complaint and asked for the legal compensation for the missed flight (over 24h forced stay in Munich) and I also complained about the dirty plane, asking for a supervisor to call me. I did not receive and calls, only a weird email asking me for my banking information, which I replied to saying I wasn’t comfortable giving this information that way. It took 5 months (November 2022) before I received another email stating that it was a safe way to give my information through the website. I did send my banking information through the website shortly after that, reiterating that I also wanted to receive a call from a supervisor. I didn’t receive any calls nor any compensation whatsoever. I tried contacting the customer service department a couple of times, they would either hang up on me or make me wait for hours until the line would magically cut. At one point I was able to speak to someone, who confirmed to me it could take a couple months for me to receive something. Its been over a year now, I still haven’t received the call, I warned them that I would file a complaint to the OTC, asked them to settle this with me before, they didn’t reach out to me. I filled the complaint, still wrote to them that I was willing to settle it in a friendly way but they still refuse to call me.

134,D Parker,France,2023-06-12,5,"I flew Lufthansa three times last year (twice to India and once to Japan). The India flights were, rather surprisingly, alright, and the Japan one less so. But my problem is not with the flights themselves, but rather with Lufthansa's frequent flyer programme ('miles & more'), which is simply atrocious. First of all, there is no possibility anywhere of interacting with a human being. For some reason, the flight mileage is seemingly arbitrary. Whereas my daughter and I flew together, she got no mileage for two of her four flights and I got nothing for one (a different) sector. How do you fix this? Well, you go to their website and scan in your boarding pass and submit the request. You get a cryptic (by that I mean idiotic) ""reply"" but you cannot reply to that and ask for a clarification! All you can do is to redo the same thing you just did. Secondly, I just tried looking to see how much credit I could get with my miles towards a ticket for my kids. How do you do this? Well, you login to the miles & more website and ask for a flight on the dates of interest. Back a message saying that unfortunately no tickets are available for the dates requested, but perhaps changing the dates might help, alongside a helpful link back to the previous page, instead of showing you a grill with availability on dates a week before or after. So you go back to the previous page and has it kept your data? Of course not! They clearly do not want you to use your mileage.

138,Rita de Jesus,Netherlands,2023-06-06,1,"Problem was not the flight, although we had to run for the stop-over in Frankfurt (don't take a stop-over of 1.20 hrs). Real problem was the luggage. Had to pay 500 euros extra for 2 extra suitcases (OK) but our stroller/baby car went for free. This stroller/baby car consists of 2 parts, the bed and the frame with wheels. The frame with wheels never arrived in Sao Paulo (due to Brazilian law you have to pick up your luggage at the first entry in Brazil). Made a report via the Lufthansa website and then it's waiting but nothing happened. Called the luggage department 3 times and they just tell you to wait. Although they ask about a list of contents, which I already filled in . They gave me an email address to mail to send the pictures to, afterwards you get a nice email confirmation. But the pictures are never added to case! After 5 days still nothing. It looks like the luggage department can't just call Frankfurt and asked if it arrived there, then call Sao Paulo or Amsterdam lost luggage (only 3 calls or 3 computer systems, that shouldn't be that difficult).

I missed a step when I was originally booking online and I ended up booking my seat from Barcelona to Munich and not from Munich to Vancouver. I was willing to pay for my seat.  I didn’t have roaming on my phone so I used my friends phone. I googled how to reach Lufthansa from Spain. I couldn’t call their 1800 customer service number because it didn’t work from Spain. I googled everything from what area codes to use from Spain to call Lufthansa using a Canadian phone. Well let me tell you with all this technology these companies have they don’t make it easy on the customer. It’s not enough we have us do all the work ourselves when booking tickets and checking in, but its hard reaching customer service when you need them. Their online system is not user friendly and when it tells you to contact Lufthansa directly, but they don’t offer you a phone number let alone a number for calling from Spain or other foreign countries even though they have offices in these countries. After I managed to find their number on Google and it said it was Lufthansa’s number I ended up calling the Barcelona Airport. Finally, I did reach Lufthansa’s offices in Madrid. This woman picked it up and she was speaking in Spanish. I asked her if anybody there speaks English because I know no Spanish. As soon as I said that her attitude changed. She kept telling me that she didn’t speak English. I asked if some else there did? She said nobody. I told her all I wanted to do was book my seat, but she kept telling me to call this old number that didn’t exist because I had tried it. The irony was this woman kept speaking to me in full English sentences, but then she would say I don’t speak English? She would say “Sir you have to call this number for help” “Sir nobody speaks English here not even my colleagues” “Sir we have no manager here to help you” I told her that her English was fine & that she was speaking to me in full English sentences.  I was pleading with her to help me.  I got my friend to call her & talk to her in Spanish, and she told my friend that she couldn’t book our seats & to wait till we got to the airport. She told my friend that all the seats were booked. The next morning when we arrived at Barcelona Airport we checked in at the Lufthansa counter. We told this agent what the woman on the phone told us about there being no seats available and he couldn’t understand why she would say that because he said there were many seats available.

144,Joern Andre Horaczek,Germany,2023-05-26,2,"Lufthansa used to be a very good airline but in recent years they have practised cost cutting to a level that impacted customer experience, food and service quality and is simply not acceptable anymore for a flag carrier. I had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so Lufthansa flights. There seem to be barely any LH flights that leave and arrive on time. In the last week, I took five LH flights and every single one of them was delayed. At this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. So, we finally took off 40 mins late. I specifically booked a seat in the first row because I have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that LH changed my seat and I was bumped back a few rows. As there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more “important” than I which is not a good feeling. (I would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) So much about recognising loyalty which doesn’t seem to have a significant role in Lufthansa’s playbook anymore. Food portions were so small that I thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. Over the last years the food at LH got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. The food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). Being German myself, I do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but I just don’t see why people of cultural backgrounds other the German would eat this. I suppose the food in Business was not worth more than about 3 Euros. There is no free food or drink service in Economy at all, The only thing Lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). So, here’s the “verdict”: With Lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. There is no free food or drink service in Exonomy Class Loyalty recognition is non-existent. Food is terrible and comes in “appetiser” portions only. I can’t see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)",A321-200,Business,Business Class,Munich to Catania,May 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,1,no,True,Munich,Catania,,Positive,0.9891,  use good recent year practise cost cut level impacted customer experience food service quality simply acceptable anymore flag carrier much good travel experience last couple flight airline last 8 flight seem barely lh flight leave arrive time last week take five lh flight every single one delay occasion crew arrive late need briefing addition baggage handler available finally take 40 min late specifically book seat first row rather long legs get board pas find board lh change seat bump back rows change pf must somebody important good feeling say anything put senior people special needs people put booked seat intoxicate rich youngster much recognise loyalty seem significant role playbook anymore food portion small think hand appetizer lunch find later actually meal last year food lh get bad bad portion constantly get small food beetroot inedible celery salat cold meat cut idea kind meat german know beetroot celery part diet part country see people cultural backgrounds german eat suppose food business worth 3 euro free food drink service economy thing give free customer piece cheap chocolate apple joke verdict worth pay extra premium seat least short medium distance flight free food drink service exonomy class loyalty recognition food terrible come appetiser portion see anyone pay extra extra service unless one want free apple appetiser extra price premium ticket one buy 20 kilo apple plus one two bottle champagne

150,Laura J Roberts,United States,2023-05-19,3,"This review is of the extremely poor customer service. It all began in January 2023 when I purchased two RT tickets from Denver to Athens, Greece.

Fast forward to flight check in on April 29, 2023 and my seat assignments are not what I reserved.

It is now one week since I have returned from Athens and I have not been able to receive a refund. The on-line system won't recognize my booking code even though it shows ""verified"", and I receive error messages. I have made six calls to customer service with no service at all. I have been disconnected two times, and on other calls I am told that the ""system is down"", ""you have to do this on-line"", ""supervisors are unavailable to assist"", and ""due to the high call volume, I can't get you assistance"". The last call ended with the representative telling me to ""call back in 15 minutes"". I wish for this review to focus only on the customer service center.

158,Rene Mathieu,United States,2023-05-11,1,"I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline's customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem, we received no information about the status of our bags, and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully, a service agent who overheard our conversation, and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore, Lufthansa's reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100% of the toiletry items and 50% of the clothing, we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th, we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts, which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise, two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead, we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions.

159,Richard Lin,Hong Kong,2023-05-11,1,"My family and I were so excited to visit Venice for the first time, and booked an April 1 departure flight from Hong Kong though Frankfurt with Lufthansa.  Firstly, they canceled my outbound flight just a few days before without automatically rebooking me on an equivalent flight (incredibly, they just removed the segment from my itinerary), with just a discrete email sent to me. I felt myself lucky that I checked my email a day before going to the airport and realized what had happened. As their on-line rebooking system was completely useless (ie. they had simply removed the cancel flight segment without a trace from my itinerary, and so the on-line system could not even find it to rebook.). After 30 minutes of frustration with their useless chatbot, I called into their customer service line, and then the next 90 minutes of pain really started. I tried both their local HK and German hot lines, with a reasonable wait each time, but each time a few minutes into the call, the line would simply cut off. This happened whenever they put me on hold, and sometimes at other random times also. After trying both mobile and land lines at my end, I realized this was probably Lufthansa's IT system issue which the agents seem obvious to. In the next calls, I had to beg the agent to call me back if the line dropped so that they could complete the rebooking transaction. None did for about 10 tries! The Asia-line call center was particularly horrible, as the agent was incredibly rude and evasive, trying to argue immediately that Lufthansa had no responsibility to handle the case as the original ticket as booked through an on-line agent (I booked through Booking.com, whom I had already call. They indicated the Airline was the only one who could make the booking change). Incredibly the agent spent about 3 minutes tried to find every opportunity to evade instead of just solving the problem, and eventually the line dropped (or perhaps he just hung up on me!). Incredible that Lufthansa hires people like this for customer service.  That night, after nearly 90 minutes of trying, I finally got someone on the German call center who was kind enough to call be back after the system dropped the call. She said she rebooked me on a KLM flight that departed half a day earlier and despite the horrible experience, I thought I was saved! Next day, a Friday, my family (4 of us) rushed to the airport to catch the new flight. We had to pull both of our kids out of school a few hours early, and I left work early as the new flight departed mid-day Friday, instead of the original we booked which was early AM Saturday, just after midnight. We didn't realized the horrible April Fools trick Lufthansa has played on us until we reached the KLM check in counter.

162,J Horten,United States,2023-05-05,1,"If you are ever promised to be reimbursed for expenses when they lose your luggage, don’t ever count on it.  My two kids and I flew to Germany several months ago. When we arrived in Berlin, my suitcase was no where to be found. I stood in line for over an hour. When I finally reached the front, I was told the bags were normally located within a day. They promised they would “do what they could” and that I would be reimbursed for any expenses that were incurred. The documents they handed me stated the same. The next day: no bag. I continued to check the website, call and email. No response. The website for lost luggage just stated it was still missing. We left and stopped at several second hand stores to find cheap clothes and other necessities, including a small suitcase and toiletries. I thought I did pretty well and kept the cost under $500.00. EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER We were in Munich when I received an email notifying me the suitcase was in Berlin. The email had a phone number to call with any questions or concerns. No response to emails. Phone calls bounced through automated systems like a pinball. I selected every option throughout the entire system and never reached a live person. Two weeks later we arrived back in Berlin where we would stay for two more days before flying home. I went to the airport to finally retrieve the luggage. I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: “You can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receipt”. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information.

That was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items, jackets, etc. I informed a flight attendant about this, she apologetically told me ""I know but now it is difficult to fix this"", an attitude I respected although the problem was not fixed. A bit later, another flight attendant tried to ""help"" me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag. Then, I told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit. He just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage, claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg (which is a cheap lie according to the official website of Lufthansa) and everyone has done the same here. That is rudeness at a different level, I've never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically (1st time flying with Lufthansa though, maybe that's the problem here). He also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat, that sounded so ridiculous. All in all, instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort (without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight), the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft! I have NEVER seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights I've been present. To the contrary, all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting.

166,L Carter,United Kingdom,2023-04-22,1,"Our flight was delayed from for 3 hours it then took off and diverted to a different airport 3 hours later. It stayed here for another two hours due to weather conditions (which happens) what was not acceptable however, was not providing any food. By this point my children hadn't eaten since midday and it was now 9pm. It then finally arrived at Munich at 2230 and we disembarked at 2300. Told to head to the service desk to see what was next, especially since a lot of people including us had missed their connection flight. The queue was huge and the very helpful help desk closed at 0000 before most people could get any information. A tannoy announcement came over saying they could not provide any hotels, but people could either get a hotel and then claim it back or were welcome to stay at the airport, on the floor, and check on the flights at 0600 the next day. No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge! To make things worse it was outside in the snow, and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers, as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this, as previously mentioned, the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away, but that was a task for tomorrow. That morning I discovered that I had in fact been kicked off that re-booking. According to the app I had now reached my final destination and so the seats were now vacant and booked by someone else. I attempted to use the app, online portal, the live chat and calling up the help line number, none of these could help and told me I had to go the the service desk in the airport. I then spent from 0945 till 1205 in a queue to speak to one of the 5 people working in the service help centre (I was number 3538 and when I got there it was at 3342) there were 12 desks for attendants to work from, but Lufthansa decided that the queue trailing the length of the airport only justified half filling those positions. Finally I was told that it was a glitch in the system and that there was nothing they could do about it but would book me in for the following day. So me and my family had to spend another day in mid winter with no warm clothing. Luckily the there was no issues with the next flight, except that our laggage was temporarily missplaced. We did manage to recover it and headed out for our holiday thinking that the worse was behind us. This was just the outward journey. The I was informed on 4pm the day before the flight home.

168,C Holtz,Germany,2023-04-16,3,"The last time I flew with them my return flight was canceled 1 week prior to my trip (and the year before it was cancelled during my trip!). The proposed option was to rebook us (myself and my husband) onto a Eurowings Discover flight! This is outrageous as an offer as that is a low-cost flight and we booked Lufthansa. Instead of resorting to this option I decided to call and get rebooked to a United flight from a different city (Newark). I called the number provided in the cancellation of my flight email from Lufthansa, but the person I spoke with was a third-party agent and unfamiliar with their job. I had to give them step by step instructions on how to proceed - and their incompetence totally screwed us up on our return. The night before my flight I could not check in as our return tickets were not being recognized. I spent hours of time with a United customer service agent. The agent eventually booked our seats assignments, but when I reached the airport we could not check in! We then had to go to the counter and the agent there had to fix our tickets as my husband wasn't even listed as a passenger. She told us that this was Lufthansa's fault for not entering proper code data. If we hadn't had seat assignments we would have missed our flight. After flying both Lufthansa and United, I can say United is better. This is shocking to me as previously Lufthansa was far superior but their standards have drastically changed. The food is bad, the entertainment selection is mediocre, and worse the seats are horrible! The only positive is the staff was friendly.

When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline. In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind “unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect” - this was well below “does not meet expectations”. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we’d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I’m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. We’re going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are. I can only hope they uphold THEIR side of the agreement and get us to our destination.

The lie flat seats are the worst I've ever experienced in a business class -  they recline all the way, but they're two seats next to each other, and there's no privacy, no storage space. If you're by the window, then the person next to you, when they recline all the way, there is absolutely no way to get out - their legs are too high for you to climb over, so if you need to go to the loo, you have to wake them, get them to sit up so you can get out, then they have to wait for you to come back before they can settle down again. The little bag of goodies contained a couple of tiny tubes of moisturizer - no earplugs, no eye mask . And when we got to Munich for the connection, we had to climb down 6 flights of stairs, onto a bus, be driven out to the plane, climb up another flight of steps.

I had selected window seat 6A some weeks before the flight and then had an email two days before my flight stating that my seat had been changed to 4D, an aisle seat. I very much dislike aisle seats as I detest other passengers or crew brushing past me. On boarding the aircraft I saw that 6A and 6C had been given to a couple travelling together.

There was absolutely no consideration to me or my preferred seat selection. On arrival at Funchal Airport I was also informed that there is no lounge.

210,L Baras,United Kingdom,2023-02-06,8,"I flew Lufthansa Regional from Bristol to Frankfurt and then Lufthansa onward to Singapore. Prior to travelling, I was worried after having read all the terrible reviews, but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. The shorter flight was perhaps a third full and the flight attendants were polite and professional. They gave us water and a little chocolate. which I thought fine for the flight time of 1h30. Boarding in Bristol is by walking to the plane, and disembarking by bus in Frankfurt, both seemed well organised and with no delays. Upon arrival, the walk through Frankfurt Airport from the bus gates to the Z gates was well-signed and with no need to go through security again. The flight between Frankfurt and Singapore was delayed by an hour. Being a 747 on a busy route, the flight was full but boarding was quite fast with their automatic gates. The seats in economy are smallish but fine for anyone under 6ft. The flight attendants were again polite, professional and had ready smiles. The IFE system had a wide choice of films but was somewhat slow to use, and the Wifi wasn't working on this flight. There was a choice of supper (vegetarian pasta or chicken teriyaki) along with wine, beer or soft drinks. Unlike Singapore Airlines, the crew didn't walk around with drink trays in the middle of the night, so the next meal/drink was a breakfast (cheese and sundried tomato sandwich, yoghurt and the little chocolate).

I don't know what changed but they are the worst. The employees are super rude and the don't give care for resolving your problem. The cabin crew was polite. I travelled from Boston to Sofia, Bulgaria via Munich. My first flight got delayed and I missed the connecting flight. All of this was Lufthansa's fault not mine. I had to stay at Munich airport for 4 hours straight in a line for the customer service desk so I can be rebooked. The people at the line were crying because we all have different final destinations, no one seemed to care. I was with my dog (Pomeranian) that travelled with me in the cabin. I tried to explain that because there is not a pet relief area I can't stay for hours and hours at the line - they didn't care. There were people with small children that explained the same thing - they didn't care. Finally after a horrific wait I was booked on another flight to Frankfurt and from there I had to go to Sofia. Surprise! The flight was delayed again. I was left with 10 minutes to board the other flight. I ran through the airport because they didn't offer transportation to the gate even though all the delays are their fault, and let me tell you that there were no severe weather conditions or any complications of that sort.

We booked our flights based on price more than anything else, so we weren't expecting a great deal. Boarding was straightforward and not delayed. The A340 had a 2-4-2 configuration, and one of the crew had whispered to me ""the flight is empty, once we say boarding completed, grab yourself a row for sleeping""; unfortunately, the couple in front of me decided they would have a row each, so my wife and I had to settle for a pair of seats each. Compared to the Singapore A350, the Lufthansa plane was showing its age, though it was fairly clean and tidy, but the toilets in particular had seen better days. We were served dinner soon after departure, which was a hot meal, there wasn't anything else on offer, and anything between that and breakfast had to be purchased, which I did not expect from a full service carrier. That said, one of the cabin crew pointed this out and suggested I may need more than one beer for the 14 hour flight, so placed 2 spares in my seat pocket. The inflight entertainment system was OK, though the range wasn't as good as others, particularly on the music channels. Breakfast was very odd; it was a very large cheese roll - more like lunch than breakfast, with a thick lump of cheese and no pickle.

230,Peter Loni,United Kingdom,2023-01-06,7,"Turned up 3hrs before departure time. Joined the business check in queue, There were 4 people in the queue, The two passengers at the counter had reservation issues and it took approx 45 mins to sort it. Meantime we waited, and waited and waited. Most of the economy queue had checked in by the time we did, Fast track security, which made very little difference. LH use the upper deck lounge for business passengers, I definitely wouldn't pay for it. Grumpy, unwelcoming, miserable looking staff. Male toilet out of order. 10.15am I was told that I couldn't have a croissant as breakfast was over. Once on board the aircraft your seat is an economy seat with the centre one blocked off. No different to BA. The cabin did look a bit tired and used, Cabin Crew were lovely and the catering was of decent quality if a bit miserable. On the return trip the crew were exceptionally nice especially the Purser. You could tell that this lady enjoyed her work. I was impressed with her friendliness and attentiveness. Drama in Glasgow though when my luggage wasn't on the belt. Menzies aviation didn't seem to care. They didn't even give me a lost luggage ref number and also did not put my contact details onto the computer. They have done everything possible to prevent you from phoning them. A call to LH the next morning got thigs sorted. Menzies received my luggage on the morning of the 3rd Jan and didn't deliver it until the afternoon of the 4th.

Again I called to customer care and able to reach them after another hour of struggle. They said it's booked but not confirmed from Singapore Airlines, so you need to wait.

After a 12.5 hour journey from Singapore to Frankfurt, I arrived to Frankfurt only to get a message from Lufthansa saying my flight was cancelled. No other explanation or information given. Staff directed me to the Lufthansa service Center still refusing to give an explanation. There were over 120 people waiting in the line before me, all of whom had their flights delayed or cancelled from different countries. I waited over 4 hours in that line from 6pm to 10pm. When I finally got to the front, they told me the next flight to Madrid was the following day morning and was even put on the waitlist of that flight because it was so full. I was stuck in Frankfurt (-4deg Celsius) for the night with no additional clothes or my coat because they would not release my luggage. The next day by some luck, I got on the flight to Madrid which was at 10.15am. Due to delays, the flight left at 1pm.

242,F Barnes,United States,2022-12-24,1,"I used to love this airline and fly LH all the time. What's happened to you, Lufthansa?? The most horrendous customer service, full of misleading information, and no result, in over 6 months! Needed to rebook parents' flights due to my father's medical emergency back in June... called a zillion times, phones constantly disconnecting, three times spoke to a different rep who rebooked for me, three times supposedly booking was confirmed, but then the booking code disappeared from the LH website... I'm beyond appalled!!! What a scam this airline has become!! I kept calling 1800 645 3880, the USA phone number. For weeks, even months, the voice message would say that the lines were busy and to call later. I finally got my call answered in November. I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. I tried the second time. The second rep assisted, I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. Five times in a row! This cannot be normal. At one point, I asked the rep whether they were having issues with phones, and she responded yes, but they are being worked on. But I called on other days, too, and it was the same. I got disconnected every time I got a rep on the phone. Is this a tactic by Lufthansa to keep customers away? Basically you can't get anything solved, since you get disconnected every time!! And I repeat, EVERY TIME!!! Over a span of two weeks, I called the US phone number about 10 times, and got disconnected every time, after I explained to the rep what I needed. So I called the German phone number +49 - 69 - 86 799 799, on December 5, 2022. The rep reviewed the files and offered to rebook my parents' tickets. We spend over an hour on the phone (and got a message from AT&T phone company that I just got charged $200 for the long distance call). The rep gives me a new booking code. She took my credit card number and said I would be charged $41.23 for tax, and $150 for rebooking, for either of my parents. I agreed to these terms. The rep gave me the new booking code. I checked on the website, and the code was on the LH booking site. Two days later I checked again, and the code was no longer there. I called +49 - 69 - 86 799 799 again. Asked a different rep why the code disappeared from the LH website. The rep checked, and said it was because those flights were no longer available (nobody let me know that! Imagine my parents going to the airport on the day of, and find no seats on the plane!). She offered to rebook to ‘available’ dates. Took my credit card information, told me that I would be charged $41.27 for either parent, the booking code would stay the same, and now we’re supposedly confirmed. I received an email from Lufthansa with confirmation. However, the email also said to “Please call back your Lufthansa Service Center”. I smelled a problem again! I called Lufthansa, spoke to a rep, who checked the booking, and she assured me that everything was in order. I also checked the website, and the booking showed. Two days later, IT DISAPPEARED AGAIN!

I have been up for over 36 hours at this point and my flight has been delayed multiple times. It was originally supposed to leave at 1040 am and now we are looking at 600pm. We are going to Chicago, and from there have a flight to Charlotte, NC before driving 3.5 hours home. This is on top of being told we will be provided a “meal” but being given only trail mix, some kind of chocolate cookie bar, water and juice. We were also loaded onto shuttle buses that had very few seats, we were packed in like sardines, and taken to the tarmac to board a new flight. We watched them load our luggage while we sat stationary on the tarmac with no explanation. Then they started unloading the luggage back off the plane and we began receiving texts that our flight was delayed again until 4pm them immediately received another text stating it was delayed until 6pm. My partner as significant rheumatological health problems and did not have access to a seat, which is a problem for her, and was in tears from standing stationary on a flat hard surface for so long. There was poor air circulation on the shuttle and the close proximity of everyone packed onto the shuttle quickly made it become suffocatingly hot.  We waited approximately 45 minutes on the shuttle in front of the plane before being told, with zero explanation, that we were being taken back to the gate we had just left.  We were then told that our gate was moved from z54 to B23, which is quiet the hike in the airport. This is on top of sleep deprivation and zero real food. I began researching Lufthansa customer rights and found that we are supposed to be provided with a meal voucher to be used at participating restaurants within the airport and that it is built into the bar code of the boarding pass. When we went to use it, the lady at the restaurant said it was something they honor and use but when she scanned the code, she said it hadn’t been activated by the airline yet. When we came back to the counter to see about having it activated, we were told they couldn’t activate it and a manager had to. It is now 408pm local time.

256,F Sun,United States,2022-11-20,1,"I felt compelled to write this, even though nothing I am going to describe in my recent travel experience hasn't already been written by others. The only thing I can add is that I am shocked that the Department of Transport in the U.S. and the FAA continue to allow Lufthansa to operate with impunity. I have flown Lufthansa for decades, (because I primarily fly on United, and being the Star Alliance partner, inevitably I would be on Lufthansa in the European portion). This month was the first time I traveled outside of the U.S. since the pandemic. I had heard that Lufthansa has completely fallen off the cliff in terms of service, reliability and even general operational adequacy, but I thought, a short 2 hr flight RT between Frankfurt and Madrid, how bad can that get? Their seats booking system is broken, and while we had paid for premium seats over and over again (and promised previous overcharged payments would be refunded, I don't expect to see that refund), we essentially had no premium seat assignments up to the day of departure. Their ground crew was rude and hostile, (e.g. just did not answer my questions, rolled their eyes and smirked with agents next to them, etc.), and the flight crew basically was not present throughout the flight. No service whatsoever on the flight (no snacks, no drinks, I didn't know this is a discount budget airline?). Mobile boarding pass could not be issued at time of check in, I had to line up at airport, at which point, the agent harassed me by insisting on weighing my carryon (they did not insist on doing that for my husband who is White), and said my carryon was 1 kg over, so I had to check it.

Nobody congratulated me. The food quality is very bad. LH served us lunch after one hour of flying. The food was too dry as LH have overheated it. Then left us without food and drinks for almost 8 hours, then served breakfast with the most worst sandwich you can eat in your life. If you are hungry during the flight, you need to pay for snacks. They have a Green strategy, but most of the people around me did not finish the sandwich, which as a consequence lead to more waste. Pillows and blankets are very bad quality. The cabinet temperature is very cold. Toilet was not cleaned frequently. I am not speaking about a short flight, it is 10 hours flight.

277,Stan Fong,New Zealand,2022-11-04,2,"I was flying out of Geneva to NZ, via Frankfurt and HK. From Frankfurt I had a 1 hour - 40 minute stop over to reach my connecting flight to HK. An hour before the flight was due to depart I received an email advising me that my Geneva tō Frankfurt flight was going to be 15 minutes late. 30 minutes later, I received another email advising that the flight would now be an hour delayed. A Lufthansa representative eventually advised the delay due to a ‘technical’ problem, and that ground staff would at Frankfurt would be on hand to help all passengers with late or missed connecting flights. While waiting for our plane to land in Geneva we were told the replacement plane was smaller than the original intended plane, as such, our hand carry luggage would have to be surrendered upon boarding, This created even more delays. 40 minutes into the flight, the pilot announced that due to bad weather, the flight would be now diverted to Nuremberg. At the Nuremberg tarmac, we were given little information. Hours later we were told we would be bussed to Frankfurt, however we were waiting for a bus to arrive, and also, there were no ground crew to help disembark the luggage. Later, we were told to collect our luggage and wait for the bus. No specific area was designated. Eventually an airport representative came out and advised the bus would be arriving in 10 minutes The bus ride would take approximately 2 and a half hours. During this entire 6-7 hour Geneva to Frankfurt ordeal, passengers were not fed nor given time to use the bathroom. During the bus ride I received emails from Lufthansa advising me they had, without consulting me, rebooked the remainder of my trip home. This rebooking meant an entirely different route, and it would also mean I would arrive back in New Zealand a whole day later than I had intended. At Frankfurt we disembarked at a bus stop. No Lufthansa representative was there to greet or advise us. The bus driver simply drive away with no instructions. A majority of the passengers stood around lost and confused. Using my phone Google maps, I began walking terminal 1 at Frankfurt airport. At the terminal, we discovered it largely deserted. Not surprisingly as it was well after midnight. Most check-in counters were closed. Eventually we found some staff who handed every passenger vouchers for 1 night stay at a hotel and two taxi vouchers and told us we had to sort out our problems in the morning. Weather problems aside, if there were no technical problem with Lufthansa's plane to begin with, we would have landed in Frankfurt on schedule and avoided the airport closure due to ‘bad weather’ and I would have made my flight to Hong Kong. Even after the bad weather and plane diversion issue, the lack of support and help from Lufthansa made the bad experience worse. There was no attempt by Lufthansa to help or guide us from Nuremberg to Frankfurt, and there was no help at all once we arrived at Frankfurt. I have since contact Lufthansa Customer Relations, to date my attempts to contact them have been ignored.

However, things could have been much worse. The flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was in an old worn out airplane, with very little leg room. My seat was broken and very uncomfortable. The best they could do was to give me some thick blanket to put under. That made it better, but still not comfortable. The food was the worst I even had on a long flight. First meal was vegetarian ravioli and there was no other choice. When I commented that I am not vegetarian, the flight attendant was very rude, stating that she can only give me what she had.

Our return flight from Scotland was cancelled from FRA to Prg, but everything was so well organized at FRA airport despite covid shortages, everyone queuing was given snacks and a drink, then we were automatically given meal & hotel and taxi vouchers when waiting at a hotel for a new flight the next day. This month (October), I finally received a compensation of 250€ per person. (3 persons in total) with excuses for a cancelled flight. Since we traveled in Economy class, we bought awesome fresh ground coffee, a sandwich and Poke bowl, together for 20€. All the food and coffee was super fresh, very quality and tasty, just like the quality I prepare myself home. Definitely worth money.

Since the booking was made, there have been countless flight and schedule changes requiring us to repeatedly contact customer service to accept changes and/or find alternatives as proposed by the agents and re-book on alternate flights with different airlines, timings, dates, airports etc. Despite the extensive flexibility on our end in terms of these factors, every time we called and confirmed a booking with an agent, we were left to find that the booking had either not been made, changed again, or entirely cancelled. We have evidence documenting the numerous calls lasting over 50 hours in total, as well as all the emails/screenshots of bookings from the website documenting the booking changes, as well as the flight cancellations that were made without our knowledge and were not informed of until checking ourselves. At this time, despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, the itineraries are missing components of the journey as originally booked ie. the last leg of the trip from DEL - AMD for record locators #1 & 2. The customer service agents have not been able to resolve this and have pretty much said there is nothing they can do in terms of ensuring we have confirmed flights for the entire trip as planned and have left us hanging, without answers, and in a panic as our travel date approaches.

295,Ian Harris,United Kingdom,2022-10-15,1,"Currently flying from HND to MUC is a long trip as flights avoid Russian airspace, approximately 14hrs, or in my case 14hrs of looking at stained plastics, a clicking headset and having to push the tv screen back into place as it works itself free every half hour. Schedule changes feel very much the norm in today's travel however, I would have hoped the passenger log for my flight would have been correct. Shortly after take off the lead member of the cabin crew took his time to introduce himself to some of the passengers with some polite chat. At this point it became apparent, despite checking in 12 hrs earlier the passenger log had no idea who I was. Asked if I was someone I wasn't, an accusing ""have you changed seats"" was delivered followed by the non reassuring ""oh, no don't worry"" and a clear tone of 'your not at a high enough loyalty member to warrant my time' was delivered in a closing remark. It should be easy for the cabin crew to tell the truth, so when during the second meal service I was informed that the first option was no longer available I was surprised to see the opposite row still able to order and receive, with the polite question asking if option 1 was actually available my original meal choice was found. I can't help thinking Lufthansa have stripped all customer service out of their operation, several attempts to contact the team before the flight were ignored, the only engagement came when they cancelled a section of the journey and asked me to call them, nice touch that their automatic email pretends they have tried to contact me. A small connection flight cancellation was apparently enough to confuse the booking system and the many people in the call centre.  It took six hours of my time reviewing the Lufthansa schedule and and their ticketing availability to find a route that the 'system' would allow.

297,G Fischer,Germany,2022-10-14,8,"First and most of all, Lufthansa brought me and my luggage to my destination on time and without any hassle, I think that's fair enough to mention these days. Furthermore, the flight was surprisingly pleasant and comfortable, and good service was provided, despite being fully booked. Lufthansa might not be as fancy as Qatar or Singapore, but both dinner and breakfast were decent and drinks were filled up frequently. While the seating arrangement in 2-2-2 is not the latest standard for business class, I found the seat comfortable enough for 11 hours. On these really long flights, Lufthansa now provides extra padding for the seat to sleep on and a sleeping shirt. The only drawback is the entertainment program, there used to be a better selection of movies, and the music selection is really poor, obviously that's the field to cut costs now.

298,N Keeley,Australia,2022-10-13,1,"We had paid for economy seats; my wife went online and reserved aisle seats. She selected seats in a row that was about halfway between the mid and rear toilet areas. (Around row 40) When we arrived at the departure lounge at Munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. The Lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in Business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. The clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. The suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. After some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. When we got on board, I got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that I had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. I hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. When I got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what I thought was mine or my wife's seat. A short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. Some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. The seats my wife and I endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. The seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. There was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. We noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to Singapore. Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. We had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. So, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. We received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. My wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. When we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat. The parents did their best but the crying and continuous getting up and down to silence the baby made sleep impossible for anyone nearby. Cabin staff were noticeably absent in assisting the parents.

299,Nanna Mathisen,Denmark,2022-10-11,1,"My first flight was delayed an hour and 15 minutes and as the transfer time in Munich was only scheduled for 40 minutes I missed my direct flight to Seoul. I was then rebooked for another flight 6 hours later from Munich to Singapore with a 7 hour layover to Seoul. The reason I booked Lufthansa in the first place was to get the direct flight from Europe. But apparently there was not even one seat available on the direct route the day after. I could have stayed at an airport hotel and Lufthansa could have at least guaranteed me a somewhat comfortable sleep as compensation for their delay, but instead I get to spend the night on my way to Singapore and a day at the airport, already tired from the long extra wait, not even to mention missing my meetings in Seoul that I had planned. When I booked my original ticket I had paid extra for window seats, but as the window seats were already fully booked I got an aisle seat and when I asked if I could at least be upgraded for the inconvenience I was told that it would be on my own expense. As I will be almost 24 hours delayed I thought as it states on the Lufthansa website, that I would get the necessary care during the redirecting, but all I got was a 15 euro voucher (which had to be spent all at once) in one of the airport restaurants. Sadly most meals start at 20 euros so it should rather be called a modest meal contribution instead.

300,C Gayton,United States,2022-10-09,1,"This is the worst company to fly with. We flew it coming here because my husband is European and he believed Lufthansa was a good airline. We first took it from SFO and the first problem was they made us pay for luggage even though I showed the agent that our ticket included 1 checked luggage. I always pay for luggage beforehand because it’s a lot cheaper than what they make you pay at the airport. He made us pay $75 anyways. This rubbed me the wrong way but I went on with the vacation. Of course my husband wanted to use them going back to SFO so we did. First, they left late so the plane was delayed and we missed our connection. We tried to run and make it but were held up in Germany because the lady was upset that she couldn’t find a stamp in my passport even though I kept telling her I have a residency card for Italy so I don't get a stamp. We missed our connection and then had to deal with customer service from hell at Lufthansa. They guy was unbelievably rude. I first asked him if there was another, earlier flight he could put us on so that we wouldn’t have to sit at the airport for like 5 hours. He said no. I asked him if there was a customer service centre and I guess that made him mad because from there he became rude. He told us that we didn’t even pay that much for our ticket and it wasn’t ‘that bad’ and I should be fine with it because it’s not like I’ve never had a delayed flight before. He continued on being rude. I think customer service is definitely the wrong profession for him. I have never ever had to deal with someone like him and I’ve been flying all over the world since I was a teenager.

310,D Baines,Oman,2022-09-24,2,"Not a good experience all round with Lufthansa. I thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in Munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of Star Alliance. First, the positives. They automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in Frankfurt. Also our baggage did not get lost. So they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. So, what went wrong? Inconveniently, there was not a single member of Lufthansa staff available at the airport in Munich. Thankfully we had downloaded the Lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. Customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or SMS communication. EU passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. However, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". We took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to Frankfurt departed. Having to spend a night in Munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. The food that Lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. Crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into Munich. All the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. Lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. The designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. There were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. Perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of Lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. The next morning we boarded our new flight to Frankfurt at 6am. On arrival, I searched out the Lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. Most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of Lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. They did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for Muscat, so that meant spending an extra €17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. No further dramas onward to Muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. It has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from Lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law. The only communication we've had was an email telling us to confirm our new itinerary (sent 2 days AFTER we arrived) and an automated email in response to my complaint, which asked me to submit my flight details (which I had already done 3 times by this point). This experience is in stark contrast to a previous experience with KLM, travelling to Dubai via Amsterdam, where we were given the compensation in cash at the service desk, and there was a driver waiting outside to take us to a hotel for the night.

We understand that sometimes when there is the third class, the first class, they have to downgrade the business class. But I guess this might just be an older plane and the seats were tight, and there was no storage space or little cubbies. I’m not even a tall person and I found the seats to be less than well padded. The food service was okay, but it was served off of trolleys like you were in coach. We haven’t seen anything like this in another business class. And, they didn’t give an amenity kits. When we went to the lavatories, we saw offerings of masks and razors and earplugs, but nobody told us about them, And some items were already empty. When you’re paying for business class, you really should get an amenity kit. Even if it’s not the best one in the world. The minimal amount they’re saving, that’s really shameful. Also, they didn’t offer us bottled water until we got off the plane. And the flight that was seven hours to eight hours long, they really should give you a bottle of water if you’re going to take a nap so you can take sips as you need it.

322,Sean Ingel,Israel,2022-09-16,4,"I booked this flight via Brussels Airlines, so this was codeshare. The first leg from Brussels to Frankfurt was Okay, I do not remember anything extraordinary about it, it was a short 40 minute flight in a regular plane with a regular very-short-haul experience. The second leg from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv was rather odd. We had a connection of 2.5 hours. When we landed in Frankfurt on time the screens showed us the flight was already boarding, which we found to be very weird. We sprinted to the gate, through connection security and passport control, and were devastated to discover that apparently, Israel has special travel regulations that make all flights landing to Israel go through a special process. Our gate was separated from all other gates, it had extra security and when we passed it we saw there is no plane even at the gate. So after security we were essentially locked in a gate that had only one super-over-priced store selling basic literature and food. We waited for 90 minutes until boarding started. When we sat in the plane the pilot announced that our plane ""has the wrong wheels"" and that it would take us 3 hours to replace all the wheels of the aircraft. All passengers were angry. After 40 minutes the captain announced that we will be brought back to the gate, and transferred to a different aircraft. After an hour buses were organized to the new airplane, same model, A321. Once we arrived there were a few dramas involving passengers that were mad that because the configuration was a bit different in the new plane, couldn't seat next to their loved ones. After an intervention of the German police we took off. The crew was excellent, especially A Stadelmann, who although being very tired as we did, did her best and gave an excellent service. At turbulence when I panicked she noticed and calmed me, we had a quick chat and all in all she was very welcoming, using words like ""dear"" to make me feel warm and welcome aboard the plane. The flight was regular, there was no entertainment, and complimentary soft drinks and disgusting sandwiches were given. We landed in a delay of almost three hours, the flight after the drama went perfectly fine. Lufthansa should check her planes twice before almost letting passengers fly in them! I would fly Lufthansa again to make my up my opinion about them fairly.",A320 / A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Tel Aviv via Frankfurt,August 2022,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2,yes,True,Brussels,Tel Aviv,Frankfurt,Positive,0.9743,  book via brussels airline codeshare first leg brussels frankfurt okay remember anything extraordinary short 40 minute regular regular experience second leg frankfurt tel aviv rather odd connection hour land frankfurt time screen show us already board find weird sprinted gate connection security passport control devastate discover apparently israel special travel regulation make flight land israel go special process gate separate gate extra security pass saw gate security essentially lock gate one store selling basic literature food wait 90 minute board start sat pilot announce wrong wheel take us 3 hour replace wheel passenger angry 40 minute captain announce bring back gate transfer different hour bus organize new airplane model a321 arrive drama involve passenger mad configuration bit different new seat next loved one intervention german police take crew excellent especially stadelmann although tired best give excellent service turbulence panic noticed calm quick chat welcome use word like dear make feel warm welcome aboard regular entertainment complimentary soft drink disgust sandwich give land delay almost three hour drama go perfectly fine check plane twice almost let passenger fly fly make opinion fairly

I have been a Lufthansa customer for over 30 years. Mainly I fly from the USA to Europe and around Europe. However, the last trip was a nightmare.

I made the reservation 6 months before departure. 8 days before departure, I received an email informing me that my scheduled flight LH1363 from Katowice to Frankurt was canceled, no reason was given, and no alternative flight was offered either.

I checked the connection from Krakow to Frankfurt on a regular Lufthansa website and guess what? There was a flight from Krakow to Frankfurt LH 1371 on the same day and time as my canceled flight from Katowice. I called Lufthansa USA again with a request to change the canceled flight from Katowice to the one from Krakow. A sleepy lady (probably from India because she spoke English poorly) stated that there is no such flight! And he can offer us a flight from Katowice To Berlin from Berlin to Munich and from Munich to Frankfurt. Of course, I interrupted the conversation because my patience was exhausted. On the Lufthansa website I have easily booked a flight from Krakow to Frankfurt LH1371 (July 22.2022).

365,Martin Saewe,Germany,2022-08-04,4,"One way flight after US road trip from Seattle WA back to Germany Frankfurt in Business Class. Price was outrageous, around 6,700 EURO / person, so 21,000 EUR altogether. Service for that price was completely inadequate. Seating: I'm tall but not super tall (6 ft 5''). Did not fit while sleeping into the narrow seat on the A330-300 Business Class, thus couldn't sleep at all. Used to fly a lot between NYC and FRA on the 747-800 (Business Class). That is a completely different size of seat, so it feels like they are trying to fit more seats into Business Class by shrinking the comfort.  Not enough Meals: We were 3 persons on that flight, each person getting their menu at the beginning of the flight. Turns out, they couldn't serve us what we wanted as they did not have enough meals on board. Compare that against the ticket price of 6,700 EURO per person. Also cabin service overall was mediocre ... this is a 9 h 30 min flight and there was close to zero service between meals. You had to actively get up and ask for anything you wanted. Can understand if you try to minimize disturbing sleep of the passengers, but no service is not the answer to that. Lastly, I have gold status (Senator) at LH and was asking at check in if they could connect that flight with my miles account which they said they did ('Are you sure?' Yes!). Turns out, this is not the case. Other than that, check in was nice and helpful. So overall after that experience in combination with that premium price, I would say LH are on the way to serve the market with premium marketing and price, but mediocre performance.

366,Yolanda Rial,United States,2022-08-04,2,"Lufthansa provides really poor customer service. We had to cancel our flight because they denied our kitten from flying with our family. This was because there is a ""2 pet limit"" of pets that can travel in cabin. But why would they have such a tight limit for small pets that travel in a carrier under your seat? We had booked our flights 2 months in advance and there was no option to add a pet to our booking online. Customer service agents and supervisors were extremely unhelpful.

369,Graham Bartram,United Kingdom,2022-08-03,2,"This entire flight was a disaster and Lufthansa's customer service dreadful. I originally booked in mid June to fly with Lufthansa to fly from LHR to LJU via FRA on Friday 8th July in Business Class. On 6th July they cancelled my flight from FRA to LJU. After many hours struggling with Lufthansa customer service and their useless chat-bot I finally managed to rearrange my flights for Saturday, arriving in Ljubljana at lunchtime. This meant I would miss part of the Congress itinerary, but the formal start wasn't until Monday. Then when I went to check in online on Friday my whole outward trip to LJU vanished! More hours on hold for LH customer services, including one memorable 2.5hr hold. Finally the managed to find flights for me on Saturday evening to Frankfurt arriving at 11pm and then onto Ljubljana at 9.00am the next day getting me at lunchtime. This meant that I would now miss two days. I got the flight at LHR, checking in two piece of hold baggage. I arrived at FRA and went to the hotel desk only to be told that the hotel I had been allocated was on the other side of Frankfurt. When I finally got there it turned out LH had sent lots of people there and the poor hotel staff were having difficulty checking so many people in near midnight. By the time I checked in it was midnight and the bar and the only food facility had closed. The next morning I returned to FRA to continue my flight. When I got on board I asked the flight attendant if she could check that my luggage had been loaded as there had been such a long delay between flights. She told me that the Load Master assured her it was. When I finally arrived in Ljubljana there was no sign of my luggage. I filled in the Property Irregularity Report and left for my hotel in Ljubljana. This was the Sunday and my luggage arrived on Wednesday evening at 11pm!

370,A Buie,United States,2022-08-03,1,"Traveling to Berlin: I flew from Washington, DC to Berlin Germany and had a very horrible experience. Lufthansa had bad communication and customer service during my journey to and from Berlin. When flying to Berlin, my second flight from Munich, Germany to Berlin was cancelled. I was never informed by Lufthansa that my flight was cancelled. A friend that I was traveling with told me that my flight was cancelled. The interesting is that his flight was automatically rebooked and mines wasn’t. I had to call customer service and get them to rebook my flight. Traveling to Washington, DC My friend and I found out when we were checking into our flights that we couldn’t check in because our flight could potentially be canceled. We later found out that it was cancelled due to employees striking. Once again, when they officially cancelled my friend flight, he was rebooked automatically with another airline. Lufthansa never rebooked my flight or contacted me to tell me my flight was cancelled. After trying to contact them all day, I finally got through and was only able to get my flight rebooked for two days after I was suppose to leave. So, I had to pay for a hotel room and stay in Berlin for an additional two days that I didn’t plan too. When flying back my flight from Frankfurt to Washington was delayed due to staff shortages.

The check in process in Vancouver was terrible as the agents are not familiar with the customer service standard at all. The boarding process was slow and delayed. The management were very unprofessional, giving me a negative attitude. The (staff) standard was low class. I would use the word cheap. A company training their ground staff to use cheap flirty tactics on valuable passengers. To me Lufthansa needs a change in managing and training their staff. However the inflight service was relatively ok and the seats were comfortable. The inflight service was ok as the fight attendants had done a good enough job to comfort their passengers. The staff in Frankfurt were ok but not overly impressive. The flight coming back was delayed but it was ok. Overall, I rate the service in Vancouver was unacceptable as it would be 2/10 but inflight was ok 8/10 and Frankfurt staff was 7/10. Good enough for my trip back. Lufthansa really need to upgrade and improve their service in Vancouver. I will be travelling a lot for my new career and I will be an important part of the world’s success going forward. I will be an important person to the country. I do not see Lufthansa as a company who tries to improve but rather a company who tries to hide from the truth.

376,J Marlet,New Zealand,2022-08-01,1,"I am a star alliance gold member. LH1019 BRU-FRA 29/07/22 was delayed by 2h45m. I knew I had, as a result, already missed LH778 FRA-SIN 29/07/22 before boarding LH1019 BRU-FRA 29/07/22. I raised this query with the staff at the gate and asked if I could be rebooked from Brussels. I was told that I had to take the flight to FRA and get rebooked there after arrival. Once aboard the airplane the captain informed us over the intercom that the plane had been running late all day. We arrived in FRA at 2330 where I was told that rebooking was not possible at that time and that I had to return to the airport the following day to get rebooked. I was given a taxi and hotel voucher. The hotel room stunk like cigarettes, cigarette burns were apparent, the bed was uncomfortable and the street noisy. I returned to the airport the following day at 0900 and waited in line for 5 hours to get to the rebooking counter where I was rebooked and checked-in on the similar route with flights departing the next day At that point my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 02/08/22 – delay 50 hours I was not given access to my luggage as these were already checked-in. I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher. The room was unfortunately not air-conditioned. The heat made the night rather short. Hygiene amenities were not available. On 31/07/22 at 1530 I presented myself with my boarding pass to the check-in counter at FRA. I was told that the boarding pass was not valid anymore and that my entire booking had been canceled. The staff at the check in counter were unable to help me and I was again told to line up at the rebooking counter. There, after another 4-5 hour wait, I was told that my entire booking had been canceled by the computer system because it had considered me missing my initial connecting flights as a “no show”. In addition to canceling my booking the computer system had also surrendered the seats I had been rebooked on and these were now unavailable. I was then told that Lufthansa was unable to rebook me on a Lufthansa or star alliance flight for a period of at least 4-5 days. After further long delays I was offered a booking through Emirates and was told that that journey was my only option to get back to New Zealand. At this point, my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 03/08/22 – delay 74 hours I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher and spent the night at tyet another hotel where air-conditioning was available but unfortunately broken! This made for another uncomfortable night. Again hygiene amenities were not available.

I was eventually provided a boarding pass for the flights but was made to pay 246 euro to have the extra piece of luggage, which was included in the initial Lufthansa ticket, carried to my final destination.

386,N Kan,Singapore,2022-07-25,1,"I booked a two way ticket but my return flight got cancelled three times. They could not get me back home in time so I had to ask for a refund and book a new one way ticket with another airline. The first time, I received an email that my flight was cancelled, they didn't even rebook me and I had to call the hotline to rebook the ticket. I was in queue for a few hours and when it was my turn the customer agent was not very friendly. However, my new flight details were never sent to my email. I added on an extra baggage for my return flight but I was only allowed one check in baggage for the new flight. Because I didn't want to waste money on roaming calls, I used the live chat option on their website, of which they are even more unresponsive and I had to retry several times and wait a few hours before I got to chat with a live agent. This time, I rebooked to another (less ideal) flight but I didn't have a choice as I had to find my way home somehow. When it was less than 2 weeks away from my return flight, I got notified again that my flight got cancelled, they said that they were unable to rebook me on a flight anytime for the whole of July to the first few days of August. When I searched on the Lufthansa website to try and book a one way flight back home, I saw that they clearly had multiple flights back home with plenty of seats still available. However, the agent said that those flights were not accessible for me to rebook. At this point it was clear that Lufthansa did not respect me at all. Not only did they cancel my original flight back home, they did not allow me to rebook on similar flights, instead asking me to delay my flight back home by at least 2 weeks. I was so done with them and asked if they had an email which I can complain to, but there was none. in the end, I asked for refund (which I have still yet to receive) and booked a one way flight with another airline. Lufthansa gave me so much trouble, inconvenience and frustration during my holiday. on top of that, their customer service is so bad and some agents were rude and impatient too.

387,G Heasen,United States,2022-07-24,1,"On 20 Jun, my flight was cancelled and I was rebooked twice to different arrival locations and delayed over 4 hours in Oslo Airport with no meal voucher. After the delay, I was flown by Lufthansa to Munich and landed just before midnight. Because the flight was delayed I missed my connecting flight. Upon our plane landing in Munich, the pilot and flight attendant staff instructed us that there are no more flights until tomorrow and to go straight to the Lufthansa service desk to assist us due to our circumstances and missing connections. Once we exited the plane and got into the airport, the Lufthansa Munich service desk immediately made an intercom announcement stating that they are closing their service desk (regardless of a plane full of people just arriving off of a Lufthansa flight with nowhere to go) and told us that there are no hotel rooms available for us, no transportation, no meals and to sleep in the airport. They were very rude to us and would not answer any questions we had.  The service desk staff told us that they will not give us any new boarding passes or more information on backup plans, etc until 0600 the next morning. Over a hundred of us were left stranded after midnight in horrible conditions.  The only option I had at that point was to find a taxi to get me home.

390,T Popov,Russian Federation,2022-07-21,1,"I would like to share my horrible experience with Lufthansa during my flight from Vilnius to Halifax when I was left behind because the plane was overbooked, my luggage got lost and the refund for the cancelled flight was 80 USD instead of 611 USD. I have purchased the tickets Vilnius - Frankfurt-am-Main - Halifax with an 8 hours stop at Frankfurt Airport aiming to meet up with friends there and travel further to Canada. Though I checked-in 24 hours before departure it turned out that the flight LH889 was overbooked and app. 20 passengers incl. me were left behind. The airport personnel first asked us to proceed to the gate and wait until departure probably hoping (!) that some places will reveal themselves. But the miracle was not there and 20 unhappy passengers were asked to go to the airport workers to rebook their flights. After 1.5 hour waiting, fortunately, a Vilnius airport employee found a solution for me and managed to rebook the flight to Frankfurt via Amsterdam. So I had to stop at one more airport and spent in the air 2.5 + 1.5 hours (Vilnius - Amsterdam - Frankfurt / Main) instead of around 1 hour 10 min (Vilnius - Frankfurt/Main). I was acceptable as long as I was on time for my connecting flight to Halifax. But the next ""surprise"" was waiting for me in Halifax. My luggage did not arrive. I immediately filed a report at the airport and waited patiently a week as it was agreed with the lost&found service. Since then I regularly write complaints and emails to airports and Lufthansa and receive no feedback at all! Nobody answers the phone either. On top of all these circumstances I had to cancel my fully refundable return ticket due to personal reasons and was shocked by the refunded 80 USD instead of 611 USD. The bad part is that you do not received the responses on your emails or cannot reach Lufthansa workers on phone.

395,G Rayle,United States,2022-07-19,2,"Wife and I traveled from Basel to Salt Lake City with connection in Frankfurt. Flew CRJ 900 from Basel to Frankfurt. Seated in front of exit row. No window and no recline seat. Good thing it was only a 1 hour flight. Frankfurt Airport was horrid. Bussed us from remote pad to A terminal. Then had to walk 3/4 mile through A to C terminal, but required to exit secure zone when left terminal A. There was two separate B terminal security lines which were at least 200 yards long. Figured lots of people would miss flights in that terminal The line for C terminal security took around 45 minutes. Although we had a connection time of 1.5 hours we barely made it through security to the C15 gate in time. When going through the boarding ticket scan I was told I had to pay for baggage which I had already paid on check in at Basel. Gate agent had no record of us paying for baggage which would have cost us another $100. I finally reasoned with gate agent that we had already checked bags in Basel and paid the fee in Basel so they finally waived the extra baggage fee. we boarded the plane exhausted and dehydrated from the walk. After walking as fast as we could From A to C, we did not have time to purchase any water because it would be discarded at security in C terminal. we were thinking we would get a bottle of water on the plane. Sat on ground after boarding for another 1/2 hour. No beverage service for at least 30 minutes after take off. No bottle of water, only a half full 6 oz plastic cup. And no ice. Servers skipped us twice during flight and only offered drink service 30 minutes after takeoff, during the meal two hours into flight and two additional times before the ""snack"" during the 11 hour flight. The snack before landing was two pieces of bread and a slice of white cheese. I had to ask the servers for some water twice after being skipped. Seats and legroom seemed smaller than those on Delta.

Did things improve when the departure date actually arrived? No, absolutely not. Lufthansa's online check-in didn't work a single time for me (multiple flights on a round trip) and the queues to try to talk to a Lufthansa employee were absurd at every single airport in my journey. Which I know because I had to talk to someone at every airport to try to get my ticket sorted. It was honestly a relief that their delays caused me to miss one of my flights because the layovers that they rescheduled me to were so tight that I'd been running frantically from place to place trying to make connections.

The second time when I booked with Lufthansa, the customer service agent has confirmed with me that my seat is booked. I called again for the second time to reconfirm with Lufthansa customer service, the Lufthansa customer agent assured me that my flight is reserved.

409,Waiyan Siu,United States,2022-07-12,1,"Arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before take off. Already checked- in, bag drop took 1.5 hours, security another 1 hour, and there is the random boarding pass checkpoint that took half and hour, then I’m late for my flight! I was still 10 mins before take off by the time I reached the gate. But there is no plane there because gate has changed and passengers are supposed to get on a bus and get to a different gate. The agent at the gate told me to go to customer service. I waited in line for 1.5 hours to see one. And she told me there is nothing she can do and she keeps pointing finger to the Frankfurt airport, to United airline (the airline that I get the ticket for a flight operate by Lufthansa), and to me! She did nothing but pointing finger. My resolution was calling United and United put me on their own flight tomorrow. And I’m still out of my own pocket for the hotel because United is not the cause for the delay. Then, I need to retrieve my checked bag and the Lufthansa agent told me to go to bag desk. When I reached Lufthansa bag desk they told me to go back up and talk to the check in counter. And the check in counter told me to go to the customer service center. The Lufthansa customer service center were full of people, then a Lufthansa agent came out and tried to talk people away. She closed the customer service center door and gave everyone a quick answer to the question. My question for her was where’s my checked bag since I’m now leaving tomorrow with another airline. She said Lufthansa has a system and the bag follows wherever I go. So I told her I am flying with another airline and how does that connect with the system of another airline. She said the system can do that but that’s definitely a lie because I have an United agent on the line when everything happens and she told me she cannot see the bag on United system. So the Lufthansa agent just shut the door, lie to people to their faces and intimidate you to make you walk away. I went to the check in Lufthansa counter again and ask where’s my luggage. This time the agent ask how come my luggage is not with me so I told her the whole story again and her comment was what happened to my us on TV everyday and it’s just me being late so I make all these excuses up. In the end, she did told me I need to go to the United counter to have my bag transfer to the United system. I cannot understand how can everyone from Lufthansa so unhelpful and incompetent. And they worst part is they lie so that you walk away and said something untrue to make you feel bad and think they are not the problem. When there is such a long wait at the airport, they need to send out notifications to remind people to come earlier than 3.5 hours, which is already a lot and more than expected. They did absolutely nothing to help but lies, pointing fingers, pushing you around. I would rather not go to the places Lufthansa fly to than taking Lufthansa again.

Had 45mins layover so couldn't make it on time to a far away connection gate at Frankfurt. No one told me to go to the service center to be rebooked.

429,D Karamatis,Greece,2022-06-26,1,"On our outbound journey, the plane departure was delayed by about 40 minutes and left us practically with 25 minutes in Frankfurt to catch our next flight. There was no ground support in Frankfurt and when we arrived at the gate we were faced with ground staff that were rude, unwilling to help and more importantly not on top of the boarding process, allowing all classes to board at the same time and squeeze through two scanning machines. Upon arriving in Helsinki, we received an email from the airline stating our luggage didn't make it and they would keep us updated. The luggage arrived 30 hours later, leaving us with little choice but to do some shopping in the morning to cope with the cooler climate. 2 days later, on our return flight, we couldn't imagine things could go worst. This time our connecting airport was Munich and had several hours to kill. Upon arriving in Athens, we had to wait till all luggage was delivered to realise that one of ours didn't make it and file a missing luggage report. This was the 6th June. To-date, I have heard nothing from the airline. The online tool to monitor the luggage tracing delivers zero updates and lacks any functionality. A week after the luggage was missing, we filed a luggage irregularity report via the PDF form on Lufthansa's website but to my dismay, the ""send"" button refused to take any action. We emailed the airline's support to receive a reply 24 hours later, with some generic content, stating that we didn't provide all needed information. Since then, I have followed up once more and as expected received nothing back. Putting the luggage issues aside, the overall experience of their business class service was totally disappointing.

We had someone in the states, someone on the ship and my husband and I continually trying to contact them, to actually talk to a person, to no avail. After several hours on hold, the cruise representative was able to talk with someone one time, but they were no help - they just passed the responsibility on to someone else. And then, one day, Lufthansa apparently just gave up - no more emails. We had to hire someone in Greece to locate and find our luggage. We were without it the entire trip - 10 days.

438,Jean Juaqu,United States,2022-06-19,1,"Just 4 short years ago I flew on Lufthansa. I had no issues on my flight to Switzerland, the food was decent (as far as airplane food goes) and I was fairly comfortable (as far as the seating goes). I checked in no problem and well you got me to my point of destination with relative ease, my my my, how that has changed. This airline has made my life living hell in just 24 hours. They have screwed me not once, not twice, but about a million times over. Let's break it down. I am going to start with their website. The website is absolutely appalling in terms of navigation, to find any information on the website, you must navigate the entire website dictionary. Not to mention the pages upon pages of useless code (meaning the pages don't work). I will save you some time by giving you a few pages that don't work - The Baggage Calculator, The COVID 19 Related Documents Uploading Page, The login and Sign Up pages, and a ton of the characters and typography. All I can say is whoever is doing the code for the Lufthansa website needs to fired. Let's move on to baggage. For a long-haul flight, I feel like a personal item (a purse or backpack), a carry-on item (a small bag), and a checked bag are acceptable, especially considering the flight was $1,500 USD. But no. Not on Lufthansa, you have to shove everything you need for a 10-hour flight into a single carry-on bag that must weigh under 8kg. I work with technology for a living and what I need for my job alone weighs 8kg. Unfortunately, I will not be able to pack everything I need for the next 2 years into two bags, so I looked for how much it will cost to take 3 bags. There is not a dang thing on the website on how much it costs to check another bag. So I call Lufthansa. Nothing. So I call again. I could not get a hold of any operator or person even within the business hours, nor would they let me wait on the phone for someone. No contact, how convenient Lufthansa. Website flaw, maybe, customer service flaw, absolutely. It is now just 22 hours away from my flight. I currently live 2 hours away from the airport and can I check in for my flight online...nope, I have to check-in at the airport conveniently located nowhere near me. Oh and just so you are aware, the Lufthansa check-in page doesn't work either. All in all, I would not wish this kind of stress on my worst enemy and lord do I hope that you the customer are not flying on Lufthansa because you won't even be able to check-in for your flight. The worst part is, I haven't even gotten on the plane and I have read bad review after bad review on the actual service and food, so that might be another review coming soon.

However, once we got there after waiting in a 35 minute line for customer service, we were simply told this is the wrong line and to walk “that way” toward the double doors. In an airport that big, you think they could give better directions but no. Then once again, we asked for more directions and their ambiguity of directions appalled me. However, after searching for the “correct” customer service for half an hour, with little to no help from anyone we found it. They were very accommodating and put us up in a hotel 20 min away from the hotel free of charge. However, we asked if we could get our luggage so we could have our change of clothes, our toiletries, etc, and they weren’t able to do anything because “they were already headed to our final destination” which I would have understood. However, as I landed in New York this morning I received a text message that my bag couldn’t be loaded on schedule, which leaves the question as to why I couldn’t get it in the first place. I was flying home for a surgery for a fractured jaw so I thought Lufthansa would be a bit more accommodating due to that fact, but no. Not at all. So I am now left with no contacts, no toiletries, no clothes and the hassle of having to reschedule doctor appointments and surgery.

449,Julie Nielsen,Denmark,2022-06-10,4,"The service from Lufthansa is below standard. If you call the service desk, they are never able to assist. The app is also not of assistance. If you want to upgrade your seats, the service desk is not able to assist or they claim everything is sold out but ask people to keep an eye for availabilities. We naturally did this, and last minute upgraded our seats, only to realize that they sell it nearly for free in the airport - this to advise that we tried to upgrade to business via phone but was told that it was sold out. In the airport they sold business cheaper than we had bought premium economy seats at the day before. Business was nearly empty on the flight and we were not allowed to upgrade in the airport, despite wanting to pay for same, as you can only upgrade once. When boarding we were shocked to see the seats, as the pictures of the class on their web is absolutely not picturing what you actually get. On the return flight, we again wanted to upgrade, as one of the ticket holders got injured and upgraded to business by the insurance company. We managed to upgrade the rest of us to prem eco only to find out, than in 3 weeks they had removed the ""all incl"" in the prem eco, hence limited avails of the drinks (both soft and alch). This wasn't even mentioned while being upgraded. Entertainment on board is very limited or not working. Very few movies, games platform not working at any of the flights and the wifi was not working on any of the flights. The food back from Mexico was not edible - and we are really not having high thoughts for food on board a flight - but when you pay a fortune to get food on board, then you should at least be served food which is being well cooked in order to eat it. Pancakes served for breakfast was not even fried enough to be able to eat it.

Once onboard, staff did not greet us, but directly inquired about the seat row.

463,Simon Jones,Japan,2022-06-02,5,"My return leg from Johannesburg to Tokyo on Swiss had been cancelled and I was put on a Lufthansa flight. The flight was OK but i really felt the food and drink situation was terrible. Johannesburg to Frankfurt was about 10 hours. The first meal consisted of a salad of carrot, squash and aubergine, a roll, a cake with raisins, and a dry pasta with some tomato sauce. Initially, I thought that as the plane was full and I was at the back of the plane that this was the left over option. It transpires that there is only one option and it is vegetarian which doesn't bother me but might others. The pasta was pretty horrible and really felt like something a student might make. Just past and a bit of tomato sauce. the salad was small and bland. The roll and cake were fine. The second meal (breakfast) was a yoghurt a cereal bar and a dry sandwich (also vegetarian). Beer and wine are complimentary but spirits are not and come in at about 7 euros. No snacks or nuts with the drink service though you can buy them. The seat was fine, the entertainment system was difficult to use and had an average selection. The second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda which was around 15 hours due to closed Russian airspace was in airbus. The plane was new and clean and the entertainment system was easier to operate. However the food and drink situation was the same. In fact the same nasty pasta was served this time accompanied by a couple of chopped up lettuce leaves. breakfast was the same too. I really felt that for 15 hours on a plane there wasn't much food.

465,P Curran,Canada,2022-05-31,1,"Dealing with their customer service has been a nightmare...to say the least! We initially tried to book through Air Canada with this flight, but were informed that as we are travelling with a pet we need to call Lufthansa directly. Everything seemed fine and I gave my debit card details to the operator and was told I'd receive my booking confirmation within 72hrs. After 1 week I didn't receive anything, so I called again and this operation took my card information as if he was booking me another ticket, again I was assured I will receive the booking confirmation within 72hrs. Another week passes and I've received nothing (we can all see the pattern here!), so I call again. This operator told me that the payment couldn't go through as it was a Visa Debit card, so my partner gave her credit card and the payment went through in the time frame or so we thought! We still haven't received a confirmation for our pet in cabin. We call again (several times) to get a confirmation that our pet would be joining us on the flight, we were given 4 different responses, but always promised the confirmation will arrive by tomorrow or 48hrs or 72hrs (depending on who we spoke to). One month passes by and we give up and decide to leave it up to chance arriving with our pet at the airport with the hopes we can take him. But it doesn't end there, about 1.5 months after booking our flights I receive another booking confirmation email for the same flight and the price was taken from my account. So I call and cancel that flight and received a refund of the full amount. I know what your thinking ""It must end here!"", think again. On the day I received my refund I had two more transactions taken from my account, totaling the amount that I was just refunded! In our preparation to move to another continent, I had missed these transactions coming from my account. So the night before my flight, as I was checking in, I noticed and I called explaining my story to the operator, she was no help at all as we were trying to figure out this issue. The call then dropped. Calling back again I got another operator and at this point I wanted to speak to someone with more knowledge, so I asked for the manager. He told me this isn't possible and that he can help me, I expressed that I have called about a dozen times to simply get a flight for 2 people and a pet, I've been booked on the same flight twice and charged three times. At this point I just wanted to speak to someone with a bit more experience. I was put on hold and told it wasn't possible for him to do that, but he did direct me to their website to request a refund, (I mean come on, that's the best you can do, submit a refund for a flight that I've already cancelled?). I thank him for and submit the form, but there was nowhere to upload the documents. So I called again, explained the situation to another person and I was giving an email to send my bank statements to and now I wait!

477,S Darlenko,United States,2022-05-21,2,It all started from our flight from Romania to Chicago thru Frankfurt. I was traveling with my grandma who is disabled and can barely move. So the problems started in Romania. The Lufthansa pilots were late for departure for over an hour. When they finally arrived the flight was delayed for another hour due to the weather in Frankfurt. So we were late for over an hour and missed our connection to Chicago. It took us almost two hours to find an open Lufthansa service desk. Three of them were closed. We had to go thru the control to get to the open one So hour and a half later (7pm) the lady at service desk told us that we have to wait till next day 10.45 am to continue our journey and she gave us hotel accommodations off the premises of the airport and there is a shuttle to take us there. 30 minutes to get to the shuttle stop we had to wait for the bus for an hour and a half to find out that the shuttle is not equipped for handicapped people with the chair. Somehow we managed to load my grandma on this shuttle and when we came to hotel they had no ADA equipped rooms or even elevators. We did mange that (I had to carry her again) and went back to our flight in the morning. We were told at the gate that we will be preboarding before everyone else. That didn’t happen cause the person who was suppose to open the elevator for us was nowhere to be found. So we had to wait till everyone boards and then walk through all the people to our seats.

480,J Neil,United States,2022-05-20,1,"This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Late departure, cramped seats, underseat storage was only 3 half-size slots for 4 people (not big enough for a regular size backpack), none of our bags fit, the entertainment system was exceedingly slow and crashed 5 times leading to a blank screen. The flight attendants ignored the call button, I rang it 4 times in 30 minutes and they never peaked out from behind the curtain, I could hear them chatting on the other side, there were numerous other call lights illuminated in the cabin - all went unattended. When I arrived at the transfer airport, they shuttled us all onto our new flight only to wait several hours on the tarmac before telling us that the flight was cancelled. When we were returned to the terminal, the line to speak to customer service was about 500 people long. I waited in line for an hour before an airline employee came and told a large group of us that there was another service desk on the other side of the terminal with no line. He led us all the way across the terminal only to find that the line was easily twice as long. I ended up waiting in the new line for another 2 hours. When I finally got to the front, I was told there was only 1 seat left on any flight on any airline to my destination within 48 hrs, it left 31 hours after my original flight and I had to take it now or leave it. I took it, only to find out on my way to the hotel that I could have rebooked my flight in about 60 seconds via the chat bot on their website and caught a flight within 2 hrs (it had multiple seats available) By the time I discovered this, it was too late to return to the airport and catch the flight, so I had to spend a night in the stopover city, arriving at my destination more than 24 hrs late. The entire experience was a nightmare and I don’t understand how they’re still in business. Speaking of which, the taxi and hotel immediately knew that I was coming from a cancelled Lufthansa flight, it seemed like all of their business came from customers in the same situation.

For Lufthansa also, the company modified the flights, telling me that some of the internal flights were to be modified, around March. It took hours with customer services to find and agree on another internal flight, only for the trip to be cancelled two days later. This has happened several times. The company is now cancelling all these flights in April, which is understandable in view of the global crisis. The postponement of flights is done on the month of May, where the customer service simply tell me that my flight has been moved as is to the following month. A few weeks before departure, internal flights were also cancelled, forcing me to spend hours on the phone to get a new flight and keep my trip. Once done, the flight was cancelled again, telling me that the company had no flights in April and postponed my trip to May. It's also the same story when my May flight date arrives, hours on the phone to change an internal flight after it was cancelled only to be told that my flight has to be rescheduled for June. Except that I consulted the company's website to check if a new reservation was possible. Indeed, the company was operating flights but the tickets were close to 5000$. The company's strategy was simple, postpone my flight booked in November 2019 for 700€ to avoid losing a seat which was then sold at five times. I had to buy another ticket (from another company) to be able to return.

493,Rohith Jayawardene,United Kingdom,2022-05-10,3,"I've flown Lufthansa many times before, mainly because of its competitive pricing (if booked early), and don't mind connecting flights. But one of its biggest disappointments on the service front is its lack of consistency. On some short-haul flights, the service has been excellent, being addressed by name and frequently checked on if I needed anything, and good food, and on others the service was almost nonexistent. On boarding my flight at Heathrow, and from Munich to London, there was no priority boarding, but the first ten rows ushered in first. There was no welcome, and Anti-bacterial wipes were handed out, but not on the return flights. On the London to Munich sector, breakfast on board was quite substantial, with ham and cheese, cereal, but with cold bread and croissant. On the flights to Rhodes and return to London, the food was unappetizing. One expects a hot meal for lunch and not a concoction of something cold. On the flight from Rhodes to Munich, there were only two passengers in the business cabin. However, the lunch was swiftly served, cleared within about 15 minutes, and the crew not seen until landing. Overall, although there was no interaction with passengers, the cabin crew was efficient and polite. On the drinks front, seconds were not offered, and I had to ask for them. As for seating, it is as most European airlines are, with no extra legroom, except for the middle seat left empty. I was disappointed with the downgrading of Lufthansa's overall in-flight service, and only give my thumbs up for good value when it comes to the ticket price.",A320 Neo,Business,Business Class,London to Rhodes via Munich,May 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,,4,yes,True,London,Rhodes,Munich,Positive,0.9501,  flown many time mainly competitive pricing book early mind connect flight one big disappointment service front lack consistency flight service excellent address name frequently check need anything good food others service almost nonexistent boarding heathrow munich london priority board first ten row usher first welcome wipe hand return flight london munich sector breakfast board quite substantial ham cheese cereal cold bread croissant flight rhodes return london food unappetizing one expect hot meal lunch concoction something cold rhodes munich two passenger business cabin however lunch swiftly serve clear within 15 minute crew see land overall although interaction passenger cabin crew efficient polite drink front second offer ask seat european airline extra legroom except middle seat leave empty disappointed downgrade overall service give thumb good value come ticket price

Over the years I have traveled numerous times on Lufthansa and I’m sad to say that this time around, Lufthansa did not live up to its reputation of being Europe’s 5 star airline. The meal choice was poor (only veggie pasta on both legs) and the service of the crew left much to be desired. It seems like the lack of customer service just gets blamed on Covid. Worst of all was the terrible spacing/leg room in economy class. It is big enough for a 10 year old kid but not for a normal size adult. It really felt like the airline wanted to cramp in more passengers to make up for the losses incurred during the pandemic without any regard to the comfort of passengers. On the second leg of our journey we even wanted to upgrade to premium economy or business class but turns out since the FRA-JHB route is so busy, both flights were fully booked. As a Miles and More member I was deeply disappointed. I usually don’t complain about airlines and I’m not pleased I even had to write this one.

534,Tim Weber,Germany,2022-02-12,3,"The decline of Lufthansa in the last 10 years is among the worst in the industry, service reductions and cost cuttings wherever you look. It started with check in, which in Berlin is done by a contract company that is not able to provide its agents with accurate information on entry requirements.

Flight from Berlin to Munich on time, but otherwise nothing to praise about it. Lufthansa has introduced a buy on board service on domestic and European flights, but they didn't offer anything on this flight, so even if I had wanted, I couldn't get a coffee or snack. Munich airport is very easy to transfer, but repeated document checks at the gate resulted in a delayed departure. First time flying in Lufthansa's premium economy, and while I liked the seat comfort and additional space, it's disappointing that the service has been reduced to exactly the same as in regular economy, apart from a tiny glass of juice after boarding. They also cut the nuts or crackers with the first drink round, and they now serve coffee or tea together with the meal. That doesn't make any sense as your coffee will be cold once you have finished the meal.

542,Tatjana Olsen,Malta,2022-01-09,1,"I have flown with Lufthansa on 26.12.2021 from Copenhagen to Vienna, and unfortunately lost my connecting flight from Vienna to Malta. So on 27.12.2021, I flew from Vienna to Frankfurt, and then Frankfurt to Malta where Lufthansa has lost my baggage. The lack of communication from Lufthansa and the lack of service that has followed ever since is beyond belief. I received a message as soon as I landed in Malta on 27.01.2021 that my suitcase had not been loaded on the flight. I checked with Lufthansa at the airport right away and filled the correct report – I was instructed to do nothing more and to call Malta Airport and check the next day and arrange for delivery. The luggage has still not arrived and it is 2 weeks later 09.01.2022. From what I was told by the Lufthansa desk in Malta they tried to communicate and investigate with Vienna with no response. From what I can see on the Lufthansa tracking on their site the baggage was sent on 28.12.2021 from Vienna to Malta, and then for some unknown reason from Malta to Frankfurt - however, Malta Airport is reporting the luggage never even landed in Malta. Since then I have had to contact Lufthansa who claims there is no report even made, I have called Frankfurt Airport, Vienna Airport, and Copenhagen Airport to try and get some assistance, I have been passed around and have to communicate with Central Baggage Services and World Tracker – this is beyond infuriating and also just simply unfair as Lufthansa should be able to at the very least guide me in what to do and see where the error happened.

Also, they do it efficiently - the delays are within normal limits, the luggage has arrived on time, the check-in process was okay and the aircraft was modern and quite comfortable.

571,Anna Karmazina,Ukraine,2021-11-21,10,"I would like to thank Lufthansa and its airport crew Cristian Lenz. He is a life saver! On 13-14th of July, 2021 my family and I had to fly Lufthansa Miami - Frankfurt - Kyiv with 2 month old baby, but our flight from Miami delayed for 2+ hours because of weather conditions, we missed our next flight, so, in Frankfurt we asked to give us any flight even through other Germany city, just to get home faster at the same day, so, we've got such a flight with extra city. We were so much tired, with a so little baby, so many and hard flights. At that (third) city (i don't remember which exactly, it was just for transition), we were already exhausted. We forgot my small bag at the airplane with my phone, documents, bank cards, money ut already couldn't return for it. I was in panic, cause in 1.5h we had another flight, to Kyiv. I, with a little baby on my hands, saw an airport crew guy - Mr Lenz, told him about my trouble. Truth be said I didn't think he can help, i thought he sends me to the special service for finding things  as most are doing.. But he said: don't worry, take care of your kids, I will get it for you. I was very happy. The airplane already wasn't at the place, Cristian did real magic and found that my bag before our next flight. I appreciate it so much! I even don't know what we would do, especially with 2 month old baby, who was already very tired. I'm so grateful this Person for His heart and willing to help.

577,J Wachie,United Kingdom,2021-11-08,5,"The first leg BER-FRA was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft. The flight is completely full and the boarding was chaotic without much prioritisation of the Group number. Most passengers brought along huge cabin luggage. The gate staff announced to encourage passengers to check their bags free of charge, but they didn’t go out of their way to pick some obviously large and oversized bags. Once onboard, the overhead bin filled up quickly. Cabin crew were standoff-ish, saying that it was not their job to facilitate the space arrangement.  The flight was further delayed because passengers continued to run up and down the aisle to find space. Once arrived in Frankfurt, there was nobody at the gate to facilitate connecting passengers, so everyone ran for themselves. My second flight FRA-LHR was also further delayed for unknown reasons. Upon boarding, I was told to go to another gate staff to have my documents checked for COVID & locator form etc. The other staff  refused to do it because it wasn’t her duty, whilst the one holding that duty was nowhere to be found. Once onboard, again, similar situation with the overhead bin space reoccurred, but this time the male steward were slightly more hands-on than the previous flight, but they still could do more. This trip wasn’t the first time I encountered LH cabin crew staff’s attitude towards assistance with the overhead bin space. Since before COVID, I’ve gradually switched from BA to LH as my preferred full-service airline, but the LH cabin crew attitude is making me think twice on my future flights, especially LH has now scaled down the inflight catering whilst BA started to offer some free stuff

578,Nuno Fernandes,Ireland,2021-11-06,1,"Booked and paid a return flight in June 2021 (6 months in advance) with Lufthansa from Dublin, Ireland (DUB) to Rio de Janeiro (GIG) with an inbound flight on November 19, 2021, and a return flight on December 13, 2021. The company canceled the inbound flights twice where I had to call multiple times to have them rescheduled. Within one week of our travel, they canceled (again) the last leg. When I called (again), this time, I was told that the full ticket was canceled and, there were no other available flights for November or December. The free flight change would only cover flights to the same destination within 7 days of the initial booking dates. If I would like to reschedule for January onwards, I would have to pay 1100 Euro per passenger. Or, according to customer support, the best option was to get a refund and book the flights with another company. Being close to Christmas (a peak period) increased our travel costs by more than three times. Even worse, we are traveling because of our wedding ceremony scheduled for December 4, 2021, limiting our flexibility options. We had to postpone our wedding for more than one year due to the pandemic scenario and, now we receive this unpleasant ""gift"" from Lufthansa, which will add stress and increase costs.

On short flights it were often just a few bites very nicely presented which gave you the feeling to be a well treated guest by them (and you also always paid the high price for it). On the most recent short haul flights I took with Lufthansa I was shocked the food served in business class has been downgraded while ticket prices are as high or even higher as ever before. The food served on my business class flights were uninspired tasteless sandwiches. They looked similar to the sandwiches Lufthansa used to serve in Economy until a few months ago. If this is their strategy to attract full fare paying guests in Business they really got it wrong. It’s an absolute disgrace for people paying so much money expecting a standard above average.

593,M Leo ,United States,2021-09-27,1,"I booked a 4 leg round trip with Lufthansa a month ago. A week back I got an email notice that they have cancelled the flights in 3 legs of the 4 leg round trip. They gave me an option for an intermediate leg that starts about 6 hours later from Frankfurt and options to cancel it and ask for a refund. I cancelled an intermediate leg as it is of no use as I cannot magically transport myself to Frankfurt and have my luggage automatically loaded in the aircraft for an onward journey. When I clicked refund my ticket, it errors out on their site and asks you to contact their customer service. I have been on hold for more than 2 hours on three separate occasions and yet unable to get in touch with their customer service. An email sent to their customer service to process my refund came back with a canned response from a DONOTREPLY email address. I have started the process of disputing the charge through my credit card company because according to their flight cancellation email I am entitled to a refund, just there is not way to request a refund online or via phone.

594,Yevheniy Kahanovych,Ukraine,2021-09-23,2,"Paris to Kyiv via Munich with carry-on only. The good news first. Both flights were on time. Both planes were clean. Both crews were courteous. Then the bad news time comes. Online check in was disabled. I arrived to check in desk at CDG2B 3 hours before departure (guessed that all who normally use online check in should be already there). My guess was just partly correct. Not just all Lufthansa, but also Swiss, Austrian and some other airlines sadly shared 3 or 4 staffed desks to check in all the flights to Munich, Frankfurt, Zurich, Vienna and God knows where else. The queue was endless and moving in the slowest possible pace. Things looked quite scary, so I opted to go directly to business class check in with my Turkish frequent flyer card (unsure whether eligible for that). After some 25 min of wait (at business class line folks) I was checked in and given tags for my carry-on.  Boarding was a mess. Calling passengers by groups (to lessen physical contact I guess) gate agents then asked everyone to form a standing queue near the gate door within a small space providing close physical contact. Then the gate door opened, so people were able to board, and without airline staff guidance things got back to normal. Onboard it was ok. The seat back recline has been eliminated since new A320NEO came to fleet, so seat comfort is now not on par with low cost carriers. A bottle of water and wet napkins were handed out. We took off and landed on time. Disembarkation in Munich also went by groups. It slowed things down, but not badly. Then boarding flight to Kyiv was another stupid quest. Without any announcement all the passengers were re-directed to another gate. There instead of boarding we had to get our boarding passes stamped. But with stamped boarding passes instead of boarding the plane we were diverted to the initial gate where they were trying to enforce boarding by groups ignoring the fact that stamping passports was not done by groups, so they were finally able to form quite a big disorganized crowd. Boarding took forever and some more covid infection was spread in this interesting way. Onboard it was uneventful. Overall disorganized, incompetent on the ground, uncomfortable in the air, overpriced and unworthy. I tried their inflight wireless.

597,N Helscher,Luxembourg,2021-09-17,1,"My daughter was denied boarding.  The adventure began already in the night before the flight when I tried to check-in my daughter electronically. This was not successful, because electronic check-in of LH asks whether or not a visa is available. In an exchange program, there is no visa, however, but an ""application approval"" and the visa is issued at the local airport upon arrival. Such a possibility is, unfortunately, not available within the electronic check-in at LH and electronic check-in could, therefore, not be performed. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. As soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. However, only an electronic check-in was possible there. This check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. Therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. After a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. Although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. When she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. Despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines I have experience with close their gates just before departure, LH refused to accept my daughter. Lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also LH has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. Not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of LH. All in all, I consider this procedure unacceptable. Two days before departure, I wanted to clarify one more point with LH and called LH's information desk at 23:00. According to the information on LH´s website, the support line is open until midnight. The announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. Since the clarification was important to me, I decided to wait. After waiting until 23.50, I hung up.

After the trip I had contacted Lufthansa about 25 times over the phone and just about as many through their email and social media. I requested a refund back in may and was told I will receive money back in 7-10 days. I called back 3 weeks after and they was no idea what refund I was talking about, they stated that there was no ticket for a refund on my account. It took me 3 hours and 4 attempts to get a hold of a live person, since the first 3 either hung up, or put me on a 30 min hold and then hung up, the representative that work for this company have zero respect for customers time and money. I always asked very politely to not disconnect the call and to call me in case we get disconnected. Not a singe Lufthansa representative called me back after hanging up on me.

612,Otto Hannuksela,Netherlands,2021-08-18,1,"Booking online for your flight, if there are no issues/canceling/rebooking is easy. Their service on the plane itself is OK. However, Lufthansa does not allow rebooking online if your flight gets cancelled or there are complications due to coronavirus. Moreover, if there is a government-imposed travel ban, they will not allow you to have refund (only rebooking, usually at a very high price because the last-minute booking is usually twice or three times the price of the original ticket). Other flight companies allow for refund, but Lufthansa is instructing their call service to deny the refunds and rebooking cannot be done online.

My wife and I bought tickets for a 10 Day trip to Scotland this year in June to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We originally booked with British Airways. Due to the COVID 19 outbreaks, the trip was canceled by the travel company. British Airways promptly refund our money because we cannot get into the country. The trip company off to rebook us again in August, and because of limited routes, we booked the second air trip with Lufthansa instead. Unfortunately, Scotland did not open this August either. I made numerous attempts to contact Customer Service at Lufthansa, but to no avail. I was force to cancel my tickets online, but they only refunded a small portion of the taxes despite the fact they cannot even take me to Scotland.

614,Michael Pataran,Cambodia,2021-08-13,1,"I missed the first leg of this flight due to an airport workers strike in Italy so I could not get to Milan on the 27th. I had to buy a new ticket due to this but all flights to Milan were sold out so I chose to fly direct to Rome and then to Belgrade (which I did). On the way back (Aug 1) I caught my flight from Belgrade (FL# LH1411) at 6:00am. The flight was 30 minutes taking off and we were airborne at 6:33am to Belgrade. My connecting flight in Belgrade was also on Lufthansa to Milan. The flight landed at 7:50am, my connecting flight (LH 248) was departing at 9:00am. The Frankfurt airport was crazy busy with very long lines. After deboarding the plane, I ran with computer back and check in luggage in tow to find the connecting gate. The first passport control (8 minutes away) line had about 4 windows open with about 30 people in each line. I asked one of the staff that I have a flight leaving very soon and I will miss it, is there anyway I can get to the front of the line, she said you have to wait. I waited about 10-15 minutes and the line hardly moved. I then went up to the airline staff window and pleaded with the man there that I would miss my plane. He looked at my boarding pass, stamped me and let me through (thank you!). I then ran about 5 minutes more to a send security passport check to get to the connecting gate. I waited in line for about 5 minutes and then was allowed through. I ran to my gate and arrived at 8:50am. I handed the lady at the gate desk my boarding pass and she simply said.. ""The plane has left"".  I asked her how the plane could leave early when they  have a manifest that shows there is a passenger on this plane connecting from a flight from Belgrade. She simply looked at me and said ""I'm sorry the plane is gone"". She then handed me a card that had a Lufthansa website address on it to lodge my complaint. (I have since lodged a complaint, to which Lufthansa replied that they have ""no fault in this"" - Unbelievable!) My question is: How can they simply just leave knowing there is a connecting passenger coming from another flight, and why would they leave 9-10 early!?

615,L Baker,United States,2021-08-10,2,"Flight from Denver to Frankfurt was dirty, despite having delayed departure for cleaning. I opened my tray table and a pile of food crumbs felt into my lap. Bit of chocolate were smashed in places. The flight attendant apologized and gave me a wet towelette to clean it up. The same thing happened with the tray next to mine. They tried to blame the ground staff, but as a customer, this is not my concern. An evidently dirty plane is gross in its own right, even more so during a pandemic, as it raises questions about how safe it is to fly with Lufthansa. Second, my bag did not arrive in my final destination. Strange considering I had one connection in Frankfurt of several hours, which is where Lufthansa's automated system says the bag was held up. I filed a report with the local baggage service at Bari airport, but customer service directly with Lufthansa has been poor/nonexistent. I have not been able to reach anyone on Lufthansa by phone in Germany or the US. The calling service offers no way to leave your phone number for a call back. In fact, the German number simply says to call back later. You don't even get placed in a queue.

622,Y Lan,United States,2021-07-28,1,"I originally booked a direct return flight from Brussels to JFK for July 25th. My flight was supposed to be at 10.35AM. The day before the flight on July 24th, I went online to do my check in and just want to make sure everything is okay then I noticed Lufthansa had cancelled my flight without booking me another flight back to the US, meanwhile, I paid for round trip. So I spent last day of my vacation 4 hours on the phone trying to solve this issue. First, it’s so hard to find a valid number to call Lufthansa for customer service. When we finally found a number to call, then it says they only work Monday to Friday. Long story short, I finally was able to rebook my flight for July 25th at 9.10AM. Boarding is so slow and inefficient. We were supposed to leave at 9.10AM but we did not leave until 9.40AM due to slow boarding. I originally paid/ booked premium economy seat, while they rebook me they downgrade my seat to regular economy. Then I have a connection flight from frankfurter to JFK at 11.00AM. While in the air I asked a crew member that I have connection flight if I can still make it and she said yes, if I ran. I ran through the immigration and I asked the guy who worked at the immigration again if he thinks I can make it then he told me he doesn’t think so because of the gate is very far, the farthest gate it’ll take me about 10+ mins if I run (Z68). When I finally ran to the gate, airline employees told me the boarding has closed. I missed my flight while my other fellow American who ran with me said while they were told this connection flight will wait for us. Then we were told there is no more flight out to NY JFK anymore for the day. We can either wait until tomorrow or go to Newark NJ. (But my car is parked at JFK long term parking). Then we have to go to another gate (Z12) to the counter in order to rebook our flight. Anyway, so I took that flight at 1:20PM (again they put me in regular economy while I paid for premium economy). Because of the whole chaos that Lufthansa put me through now I end up in Newark. So I have to figure out an Uber home or arrange pick up by friends while I have my own car parked at JFK where I booked my final destination to.

644,Marc Merritt,United States,2021-06-12,3,"This is the first time I flew with Lufthansa with family. I chose Lufthansa for a number of reasons, mainly reputation, route, price, and recommendations by others. I must say I was extremely disappointed. Terrible infotainment system - slow and clunky. Terrible economy seats - they recline but the seat pad does not move forward like others airlines such as Emirates, Turkish, Ethiopian, etc. Many rude flight attendants. Unsurprising given most are German, but still, should be more pleasant. No meal choices. Every other airline I have ever flown has offered at least some food choice ~ meat, chicken, fish, etc. Not Lufthansa! It was pasta with tomato sauce and wasn't even tasty. I sent emails to the Lufthansa customer relations department. Here is the context of my email. We traveled from Frankfurt to Johannesburg on flight LH572, departing on June 3 at 22.05, which lasted approximately 10 ½ hours. During this time, we experienced disrespect, rudeness, and overall unpleasant attitudes and service by some of your flight attendants. We were seated in row 32, seats G, H and K. I understand that food is limited, however, when we inquired if our daughter could have an alternate meal, the female flight attendant blurted out “Everyone has the same thing! If you wanted a special meal, you should have requested it before the flight.” That’s fine, but the insensitive and rude behavior of this flight attendant was not acceptable, by any culture! When the plane pulled into the gate at Johannesburg, the fasten seat belt sign was turned off. I stood up to stretch my legs as I am tall and my knees hurt. Again, this flight attendant shouted at me to “sit down until you are told to get up!” Is this the type of behavior that is tolerated by your airline? Based on reactions from other passengers on this flight, I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect, almost disdain, by some of your flight attendants, as I was not the only passenger she yelled at.

664,M Garmen,Finland,2021-02-13,1,"I had a flight Helsinki to brussels via Frankfurt. On arrival to Frankfurt, I couldn't my flight from Frankfurt to brussels. I went to check this with customer service and was told there is no such flight. I was shocked about this given that my travel dates had be changed earlier by them. The woman at customer service desk was super rude. She told me that there was no such flight scheduled for Brussels at 12.00 and if there was earlier on the flight was cancelled (12.00) and that the next one was due at 21.00 and there was nothing she could do. She also told me that is is not Lufthansa's fault that the flight was cancelled and that I should have been informed about the cancellation by booking.com from where I had booked this flight. This when the exchange between us got heated and and there was raising of voices despite the fact that there were other customers in the queue. Eventually she told me that there is nothing she can do and waved me off. This really shocked me because I am sure booking.com cannot cancel the airline's flights and the responsibility of getting me to my destination is on Lufthansa. But more surprisingly, is the fact that they never bothered to contact me about this. I had to travel to my destination by train hoping to be compensated for this inconvenience. On my return to Helsinki, both flights were late again. Upon arriving in Helsinki at midnight, my suitcases went missing. Again there is no traffic during corona time so I did not understand this. Helsinki airport was a graveyard, there was no one to ask. So for one hour I just walked around the airport looking for help which I finally got and I finally filled the form. Since I arrived late in Helsinki, I had to get a hotel room and pay for taxi as there was no direct bus to Turku at that hour. The next day I spent money buying essential warm clothes. I obviously a claim form and sent an email to Lufthansa requesting for compensation for the inconveniences: canceled flight and the cost incurred during the period (6 days) my luggage was missing. When they finally got back to me, I was shocked when they said that it is not their responsibility that Lufthansa canceled my flight and therefore they will not compensate me for the train ticket. They never apologised for the late flights and time spent looking for my luggage that led to me missing the last bus to Turku. In total I had spent 315.95 euros during this period, however, they refused to compensate me the full amount and only decided on 123 euros.

On both flights (1113, MAD-FRA  430, FRA-ORD) there were constant violations of Lufthansa's policies regarding covid-19. Many passengers were visibly not wearing masks for a long time (not just during the meals) or not wearing them properly and the crew did not do anything about it. There was also a family who wore masks so evidently inadequate (they looked like gaiters for the neck) that a flight attendant offered them surgical ones, but they were allowed to refuse these masks and continue on board! Lufthansa has to do much, much better if they really are committed to protecting their customers (and their employees!). I know it is difficult for the crew to control everything that goes on during a flight, but to be blunt, it is their responsibility and they failed their costumers who followed the rules (doing everything to avoid infecting and getting infected) miserably.

679,S Barton,United States,2020-12-12,2,"Over $3,000 saved over 2 years for this 14 day trip to Egypt. I had planned and packed carefully knowing I’m a woman going to a conservative, patriarchal country. Doesn’t matter, Lufthansa left our luggage in Frankfurt. I didn’t think too much of it to begin with because half of the time I travel international they lose my luggage. But normally they get it to us the following day or the day after at the latest. If we didn’t have 5 multilingual, wonderfully kind guides from our tour company constantly harassing Lufthansa and the airport carriers, I don’t think we’d ever see our luggage again. At first they told us to come in 2 days later before we flew from Cairo to Aswan and they’d have it for us to take with us (since they have the same flight coming in every day). It never was put on the plane. Then they tell us it will be sent to us in Aswan. We’re there for 2-3 days so they have time to get it to us before we get on our Nile Cruise. They never tried to send it to Aswan. Now we just heard we won’t get our luggage until we go back to the Cairo airport and retrieve it in person. Why? Because they honestly don’t care. They don’t think it’s their problem that we don’t have our luggage. Reminder that we’re not just in a foreign country, but in Egypt. We have a body guard assigned to us from the Egyptian government to escort us whenever we leave our hotels. “Go buy some essentials and we’ll refund you 50% of the cost.” First off, even refunding me 100% of the cost is not enough to even begin to cover this inconvenience. There’s clothes, snacks, and other items in my luggage that I bought specifically for this trip that I’ve now bought in vain because I will never use them.  I saved up money, which is precious right now during the pandemic, to come here and enjoy myself! If my luggage was delivered to me in a timely fashion, I wouldn’t have been able to relax and enjoy myself rather than almost have a breakdown.

680,Bart Van Doninck,Belgium,2020-12-06,1,"We booked a return flight with Lufthansa assuming that if something would go wrong in these Corona days it would get solved. What a mistake ! Our return flight from Crete to Brussels on the 19th November was cancelled and the proposal we received by e-mail was a flight from Athens to Brussels. When I called their customer support the first proposal was a flight on November 30 (11 days later) leaving 6:55 in the morning and arriving 20:50 in the evening. There were flights available leaving 6:55 arriving 10:50 several times a week but we could not be booked on those because we did not have the right booking class. I was asked to call again later, maybe other options would become available. The next time I called the proposal was even better: we would leave on the 29th and arrive on the 30th (a stay in a hotel was not included). I could contact customer relations if I did not like this, which I did. The only answer I got from them was that their customer services were able to handle this problem. After calling 5 or 6 times they finally arranged a flight for us: on the 1st December. At least that was what I understood because when I received the e-mail it said the 5th. When I tried to get this changed I was told that I would have to pay because I confirmed their alternative. When they were calculating the cost they ended the call so I gave up and booked a flight with another airline and got home without problems. Off course I did not want to throw away the money I spent on the Lufthansa ticket so I tried to rebook it for next year. Again a huge mistake.

717,D Tarleno,Germany,2020-08-01,1,"After paying for selected seats I saw the seat numbers had changed, one from row 6 was now row 23. Only after numerous attempts did I get through to Lufthansa only to be cut off in the middle of my call. I tried to call 4 or 5 more times to simply be cut off before anyone answered the call. I then tried using the Miles and More member number, I got through after just a few minutes and was helped by a courteous friendly assistant who, after 5 minutes, re-allocated the original seats. At no time did Lufthansa inform me of this change or of the fact they had seated two people on the same booking some 15 rows apart. I wrote an email to Lufthansa on 29.06 asking for an explanation on 23.07 received an automated replay that did not address my question. The seat numbers continued to change in the days leading up to the flight at least the changes were in the same area. 48 hours before the flight the screen showed that the seats ""could not be pre-booked on this leg of the journey¨ but could be selected at time of check-in? In line with an apparent Lufhansa ""Covid19 code of conduct"" during this whole seat reservation farce the seat next to a booked seat was shown as ""non-bookable"" .. an intelligent and logical move, a positive Lufthansa initiative. However on boarding the plane (after ground staff informing us the pre-booked boarding assistance was ready! I had no requested this and after a brief discussion the whole thing was dismissed with indifference and lack to interest on their part. Upon boarding to my surprise people I saw that in fact passengers were sitting in the ""non-bookable seats"" .. no Covid19 distancing as implied by Lufthansa. In addition to being incompetent during the booking and boarding process they were also lying about their ""responsible seating policy"", Additionally boarding was more chaotic than normal, people queuing in the aisles, moving from the back to the front of the plane: evidence of the Lufthansa “dynamic seating process”. During the flight the FAs handed out 3 documents in a disorganized and giggly fashion, requesting us to complete them. The request was in unclear/garbled English and German. When unable to fill out 1 form (as none of the options applied to me) I asked the FA how to proceed: she replied “I don’t know, I´m just a FA, just fill in something!”  One form was handed back to the FA, the other 2 had to be handed to the French authorities at passport control/security at Lyon arrivals. There were no officials at Lyon arrivals, no passport or security controls. One document was only valid for nationals from non-EU countries (plus UK, Norway.) The FA clearly had not understood the forms she was handing out. On the return flight I received a “Boarding Gate change” on my phone, the new gate being quoted as G26. As I was unable to find any “G” gates I asked a security guard where the G area was (no ground staff were at the original boarding area). We were then called to board (at the original gate) only to be kept standing for 15 min while the confused and theatrical ground staff gave us unclear and contradictory information. We we bused to the plane (overfull bus). I saw 2 “low-cost"" airlines using airbridges.

The outbound flight from Prague was great. They only gave out a bottle of water during the flight, but this is perfectly acceptable for a 50-minute flight.  Frankfurt airport is operating out of just the one terminal: Terminal 1. This means that the terminal was cram-packed full of people. There was only one restaurant open and it was expensive and the quality of the food was pretty poor.  The flight to Bilbao was approx. 2 hours, and during this flight they only gave out one bottle of water per person - all in the claim that it is because of COVID-19. The following morning, I received an email from Lufthansa - apologising that there have been changes made to my booking and asking me to either accept the new conditions, or choose not to and keep the flight open. The problem was that there was no alternative flight option shown. Lufthansa cancelled my return flight and didn't give me the option of rescheduling my return flight on 24th July. I went online and entered my booking details into their site and only my outbound flight was showing up. My ticket had been changed to a one-way ticket.

722,Tim Schuit,Netherlands,2020-07-04,1,"I've flown with Lufthansa multiple times for business and leisure and it has worked out perfectly fine time after time. The only difference this time is, I have to deal with their customer service, and this is where it goes down hill. In February, I booked a ticket for my girlfriend to come visit me and unfortunately, the pandemic hits. The airports get closed and the ticket flight gets cancelled. As I read (or mis-read online) there was supposed to be a button in the online environment to click to issue a re-fund and so I did. Time goes by and of course they violate their own policy of returning the refund. The real problem for me starts in their communication. I've been trying to get hold of their customer service for the past 5 months by e-mail or by phone. Their phone lines are either flat out busy or cut out after 2 hours of being on hold. I've gotten hold of their employee's once in twenty1 hour calls.  I've gotten some written feedback but basically, none of it was anything more than that they acknowledged the situation but can't provide any help. Feedback on my ticket telling me they cant respect their deadlines.Me forwarding the claim to my credit card company. Lufthansa re-reviews the ticket but tells they can't help me without any argumentation. Creditcard company tells me I need a statement that my flight got cancelled (which i didn't got), so I re-approach via a ticket. I get hold of Lufthansa once by phone and they inform me I cancelled the ticket myself  because their system processed my action as a cancellation and they mention to me they can't see the flight was actually cancelled. Spoiler alert, the airport was closed, it was. I'm advised to re-make a flight disruption ticket to explain this. Here is specifically ask for a confirmation of the flight cancellation. Not a refund but instead of sending me that, they issue me to the refund department. Here I realised they are playing a game with me, because the moment they send me the cancellation confirmation, I can get the money refunded via my credit card company.

I was booked on a Lufthansa flight to Vienna via Frankfurt, the day before on the 6th of November they canceled the flight from Frankfurt to Vienna, leaving me with no information for hours. I started to call the Lufthansa customer service with no success, and I have proceeded to call the Austrian air. I ended up calling the Senator Lufthansa service, due to the status of my uncle, hoping to get some help from their side. After approx. 1h 30min on the phone I finally got connected to an English-speaking gentleman who apparently decided to help me. I´ve asked him what the solution would have been and he didn´t have any information regarding it, therefore as I had to go back to Vienna due to work business I asked him to rebook me to any flight within the star alliance airlines, and he mentioned just the possibility to fly via Brussels, although there was still a spare place via Zurich with SWISS. I received an Email confirmation with my flight to Belgium with Brussels airlines and proceeding with an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna. I wanted to check- in online but on Brussels airlines it was not possible, but for the flight with AUA yes. I was a bit concerned, but I thought due to the strike this could have been normal. I arrived a bit earlier to the airport and at the check-in counter by giving them my documents their answer was “we don´t have any flight booked under your name” I was very furious as it was looking like there would have not been any solution to fly back on that day. I had to talk to other three people, until someone could have started helping me out for it, the only supervisor for five star alliance in an international airport… ridiculous, and neither from the airline but from the group S.A.V.E., company operating in Venice airport. They had to call several times, many Lufthansa desks until they told me they would have had to rebook me on a flight via Zurich (the one I´ve seen the day before, but which was never offered to me…) It was a kind of realizing news they gave me, although I was stuck at the airport for about 4 hours as it was way much earlier my scheduled flight to Brussels.

Short hops between LHR-FRA were on new A320-neos in both directions and were perfectly comfortable with a small snack provided.

812,Raquel Sasso Kessler,Germany,2019-10-10,1,"Amsterdam to Munich. We booked almost two months in advance. When we arrived at the check in they said they had overbooked and if we could volunteer to go on another flight (KLM) leaving at the same time. I figured no harm so I ran to the other side of the airport only to be told by KLM that we had not been booked on that flight and that the gate was closed. So we had to run back all the way to Lufthansa to then be told they could get us on our original flight. In form of “compensation” they offered us €250 each and put us up in a hotel with a shuttle bus from the airport. But like the previous promise of another flight, the shuttle was non existent so we ended up paying for taxis out of pocket. Next day when we arrived early to follow the given instructions about the compensation once again, no one knew anything and everything they told us was wrong. The only thing we could do was file a claim online. Of course this is a very convenient way of not dealing with customers. I called and was told if I wanted to make a reservation of course I could talk to someone, but if I have a complaint that can only be done online, nice way of avoiding responsibility and not facing your many unhappy passengers. We filed the claims, I sent all the required emails and have received no reply. I am very frustrated with what I consider to be lies and lack of responsibility.

813,Harun Rathore,Germany,2019-10-10,6,"I flew from Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt on 6 October in Business Class. The Senator Lounge in Berlin is in free fall. There was a lot of talk about the new Senator Lounge. In the end, the new one is worse than the old one. The choice of food and drinks is very limited. For breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. The croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. There is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. Shame on Lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the German capital. The departure from Berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. However, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. As I was in a good position overlooking the apron, I knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in Frankfurt. The aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. In Business Class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. For me, there was enough connecting time in Frankfurt, as I knew exactly how I could get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 quickly. I spent some 20 minutes in the Senator Lounge. It was quite empty for that time of day. The food served reflected the fact that the Oktoberfest in Munich had started. It was all very Bavarian – the same you get in the Munich lounges all year round. Within the 50 minutes I was in Frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from B30 to B20 to B27 and finally to B28. The flight from Frankfurt to Tivat was the real disappointment. The flight was more than twice as long as the inner-German flight from Berlin to Frankfurt, but the food served on board to Tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. I mean how is this possible? How can it be that Lufthansa – a so-called 5-star airline – offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? Frankfurt is Lufthansa‘s main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. Is that the impression Lufthansa tries to leave?

828,T Eldem,Canada,2019-09-22,6,"Munich to Montreal in Business Class. Having connected from Dublin, spent some time on the Senator Lounge which offers a great selection of food and beverages. Boarding was fairly orderly but started late. LH appears to be losing its discipline when it comes to on time boarding and departures. On board, the hard product offered decent space for one’s belongings but the fact that not every seat has direct aisle access remains a downside for LH business class. The seat offers limited privacy and the fact that it is angled towards the neighbour, makes it quite awkward in the fully flat position as a mere 1 inch divider separates the respective foot wells. The seat was narrow compared to business class seats found on other carriers. It was not particularly comfortable in the lie flat position. The service was in typical LH fashion, efficient but lacking warmth. The food and wine offerings were quite good however, the salad consisted of limp mesclun greens and was sort of thrown onto the tray. The snack served prior to landing was actually better tasting than the lunch offering consisting of a delicious soup and very tasty prawns.

Now, before I took this flight with my dog I made sure the flight will be the most comfortable as possible for her. The rules are that dogs can fly in cabin as long as they are secured in their carrier during take off and landing and when the seatbelt light goes off the dog is allowed to sit in your lap. I asked the rules several times before traveling because she hates being in a carrier and goes crazy barking and crying. I even got her tranquilizers from the vet just for her to be able to deal with those few minutes she has to be in the carrier. This is the way we traveled to Europe a few weeks ago. Nice and smooth she made it thru.  Lufthansa banned me from flying their airline because my dog, who came out of her carrier by poking her head out, mid flight and was barking! This pilot demanded At the beginning of the flight to keep her in the carrier the whole flight and told me that that is the rules. My poor dog hates being in the carrier, I probably would’ve not brought her if that was really the rule because she barks and cries when she’s in the carrier. I asked the pilot why he would not use his own discretion with his rules, for my dog will make the whole plane crazy by barking while being locked in a small box. It’s the rules.  I did what he told me anyway and my dog barked for 25 minutes straight while I apologized to the other passengers. So we landed in Frankfurt to catch our connecting flight to Miami and the stewardess told me that we cannot board the plane. Mind you that flight to and from the US, ESA’s are allowed to sit on your lap the entire flight, landing, taking off and all. I was not able to board my flight in Frankfurt and was told to order another plane ticket with another airline, and that I will not be getting a refund or will they transfer my ticket to another airline.

839,A Martana,United Kingdom,2019-09-10,2,"London to Madrid via Frankfurt. Flights were late. Transfer between flights was an stressful experience even travelling on business, despite knowing we were late no assistance was provided to facilitate the transfer; I was taken to the terminal by bus to find my way through immigration (thankfully e-gates were working) and to reach the boarding gate just on time to board the second and final bus (in cramped condition). Hardly time to visit the toilet and certainly not opportunity to go into the Lounge. At the boarding gate I asked about my luggage and I was reassured by the staff, after checking the computer, that it had been transferred successfully to the second plane. After boarding the plane, lunch time, we were informed that there was no catering service at all due to the recurrent issue that they have had .. for over 2 months now. But being served just a wafer is totally unacceptable, they didn't make even the effort to get us a sandwich despite departing from their main hub. Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid. I had to beg then for having it express delivered on that night (only Senators and HON members are entitled to such privilege) despite being Star Alliance Gold and Lufthansa Frequent Flyer. Fortunately the staff took pity of me and they managed to get it approved by Lufthansa. Needless to say that I sent the feedback form to customer services on the very same night. I requested for someone to call me as soon as possible. Instead, I have today (6 days later) the standard sympathetic email with the meaningless apology and the 'great' news that they will credit me with 10K miles and hope to see me on board again.

867,P Sheane,United States,2019-08-09,1,"I just traveled with my 16 month old infant on August 5, 2019 from Boston to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. I have chosen this airline for many years as a family friendly airline and for its reputation. Unfortunately when I traveled this time it was a total disaster leading me to write this review. I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference. I also want to add that in Boston at the check-in I was charged an extra $60 USD for my daughters check-in baggage. I had already paid for my one check-in back at the time of booking and was not expecting this additional charge.",A333,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Frankfurt,August 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,True,Boston,Frankfurt,,Negative,-0.949,  travel 16 month old infant august 5 2019 boston frankfurt choose many year family friendly reputation unfortunately travel time total disaster lead write review consider frequent flyer do trip twenty time never infant multitude complaint include complete disregard crew personnel unsanitary condition rude service extremely disappointed never choose company pay 1700 roundtrip ticket first pay extra special seat accommodate daughter find middle row understand choose lap option give book secondly staff economy extremely rude unaccommodating situation refuse us bottle water thirdly condition disgrace people throw aisle multiple passenger bare foot seat rest television monitor consideration others crew nothing remedy horrify thought change infant diaper bathroom condition lastly one show consideration patience aware carry infant stroller two board deplane one offer seat bus bring us twice two different terminal force us stand try loose balance understand control behavior others crew show complete indifference towards lack complete empathy passenger daughter believe crew lack care reinforce atmosphere total indifference want add boston charge extra 60 usd daughter baggage already pay one back time book expect additional charge

878,J Aberg,Sweden,2019-07-25,2,"Copenhagen to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. I have found Lufthansa becoming more and inconsistent in their performance. On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team. I was for instance able to get off the plane before almost all premium passengers. In conclusion, not Lufthansa's finest day, by far. Would I fly them again?

880,D Calikiene,Poland,2019-07-23,1,"Istanbul to Munich with Turkish Airlines connecting to Poznan with Lufthansa. Our experience started on the way back when I tried to check in online. I couldn't do it as booking code I got by email was not applicable for Turkish airlines. When I contacted via FB Turkish Airlines I was asked to contact travel agency and get another booking code. Second proposal was to call international customer line. Not working processes should be airlines responsibility and customer service shouldn’t send me back and force but should take responsibility and manage by them self. After few hours communication in FB we decided to check in the airport before flight. Early check-in was important to us because we wanted to get seats on the first row to be able to leave plane ASAP to catch another flight because we had 50 min between flights. So we were proactive and wanted to do the best. In the airport representative of Turkish airlines was surprised that FB client support were not able to check-in and told us that customer service people can see another booking number which was needed to check in (clients are not able to see). I am not angry that situations like this happens, I am angry that nobody from Turkish Airlines wants to listen customer experience and move even one finger to improve they processes and client service. And day by day everything goes worst. Instead of asking to share feedback and send to responsible people to take a look what is wrong everyone is shaking heads. So my try to share my experience in Istanbul airport was unsuccessful. At least I was able to check in and we got seats in the 8 row. But luggage was sent instead of Poznan to Munich. Probably she had already feeling that we will not reach Poznan tonight? Lucky we saw that on time and we asked them to redirect our luggage to Poznan. And for sure the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Munich was later then planned. We asked flight attendants if they can contact people on the gate and ask to wait. We asked passengers in the plane to let us go first to be faster. When we reached the bus to go to another terminal we asked bus driver if he would be able to contact gate and ask to wait 5 min (because we had to wait 5 min for bus schedule). Answer was no we cant so we had to wait. When reached Terminal number 2 we ran as crazy (maybe somebody could explain me why?). And I came to the gate 6 min late, and plane was still there.

The staff were not as courteous as expected and seemed upset. We were late departing and when we arrived in Munich, our gate was occupied by another plane causing us to be further delayed in reaching our connecting flight.

Waiting at the Gate, no staff, boarding time passes, then 15 minutes after our scheduled departure the screen goes blank and people start to panic. A dnata ground staff shows up, casually announcing the flight is cancelled, we have to exit the airport, recollect luggage and return to the check-in desks to be rebooked. 120+ passengers all scramble to arrivals, we haul our 4 items and stroller with a sleeping infant as fast as possible back to check-in where we are told there are no seats available until the following day. So we are rebooked with Swiss. MAN-ZRH-VIE. Two hours before departure I recieve an SMS that our flight is 1h45mins late. We've been rebooked! Via Frankfurt. God no. We pack and walk over to the terminal and are rebooked via Munich. MAN-MUC-VIE. Finally, an on-time departure to Munich. The flight again affected by the ongoing catering strike. By this point, I just don't care. A rude stewardess initially refuses to provide us with a napkin when we are feeding our infant, responding ""you can get it from the toilet"", before thrusting paper hand towels at us. MUC-VIE on Austrian is again delayed by an hour after a discrepancy between the manifest and number of passengers on board (how does this happen?)! We finally land in Vienna 21.5 hours late.

909,Justin Finlay,United Kingdom,2019-07-01,3,"Billund to Heathrow via Frankfurt. Very unsatisfied. Firstly at the start of my trip, I almost missed my flight to Denmark from Frankfurt as my flight from Heathrow (Lufthansa) was delayed which made me have to run through the airport to catch the last bus to my flight (I must also add that I have asthma and needed to constantly use my inhaler during the process of running to catch my flight. On my return from Denmark to London I experienced yet another delayed flight except this time it was from Denmark to Frankfurt. By the time we were meant to be boarding the plane, it had only just landed. Once we touched down in Frankfurt it was already time to board my next flight to Heathrow. Other flights had a minibus to take them directly to their next flight, however, Heathrow did not. The gate for Heathrow was announced once we landed which we were told it was B41, this was a gate change from the initial gate which was B20. Once we had finally got off the bus, I and a few others had rushed out following the correct signage. I eventually made it to B41 which I was then told that the gate has moved to B47 which I then had to rush off to. I think that this is extremely unacceptable as this is now the second occurrence in the space of 4 days, and I am sure that this didn’t just happen on the 2 days that I experienced it, this is a continuous occurrence and something needs to be done to eliminate or even minimize this issue.

918,Michael Schulz,Germany,2019-06-19,2,"Los Angeles to Munich. Lufthansa prides themselves to deliver what is called Signature Service in Business Class which means that every Business Class passenger gets assigned a personal flight assistant who is supposed to introduce her/himself to you after boarding. Ours did nothing of that sort. When I asked her, her response was a counter-question whether I would be missing something. Great service attitude indeed. We have been sitting in row 15 on the A380 (upper deck) which is separated by sort of a curtain from rows 10-14 despite all rows are supposed to be Business Class. As a consequence, we were entitled to watch how passengers in rows 10-14 were looked after by their personal flight attendants while we didn't get anything. We felt like being in sort of a second class of Business Class. I don't know whether this is common on LH flights on the A380 but it is unacceptable.  When the service finally started, we found out that other passengers got offered a salad between the started and the main course while we again heard nothing about it. Probably, it would have been too much of a nuisance to our flight assistant to serve us a salad. When the main course finally was saved, it has been the worst meal I ever had in 25+ years of travel.

920,Sarah Plack,Germany,2019-06-18,9,"On our recent flight from Dubai to Frankfurt, we decided to upgrade our Lufthansa Ticket to Business Class using Lufthansa Miles. As Lufthansa only operates one flight at night, baggage drop-off is only available 3-4h prior to departure, unfortunately. The Lufthansa Lounge in Dubai is rather small but offers a good selection of food and self-service alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. We had already eaten at the Ahlan Lounge before thanks to our Priority Pass and have to admit, that Ahlan Lounge has the better offering. But as soon as we were on board, we were glad to have chosen Lufthansa again! The service was just outstanding and ground staff made sure we were reseated next to each other (it was not possible during online check-in). We were offered drinks immediately and were shown the menu with food for later. As this flight was only a bit over 6h, Lufthansa was serving a light midnight snack and breakfast. Both dishes were really good and were met by a good selection of drinks. The seats in Business Class are full-flat on the A330 and offered a comfortable night sleep. It's not the biggest business class seats available, but definitely comfortable! In the morning we woke up relaxed and left the plane after a refreshing breakfast.

Then asked if I am going to miss my next flight? They said no news at the moment yet so you might still make it. We landed around 2145 in Frankfurt although boarding for my next flight was 2125 (flight at 2210). When I got off the plane I expected there to be ground crew guiding people with connecting flights. But there was none whatsoever and we had to take an airport bus to the terminal. Once we arrived at the terminal no staff to guide us again. We had to run towards our next flight to catch the flight. Once we arrived at the gate for the next flight it was 2221, the guy said was it is closed. I explained I have been delayed by the flight from London. He said you have to exit and get someone to book your hotel and next flight. So we had to walk to the exit again. Once we got outside we were booked a hotel and next flight. We had to wait outside the airport for the shuttle to hotels. It took us 20 mins for the wait. Again no clear instruction which is the right bus. I am not saying it was any of the ground staff's fault as well but I think as a service industry the first thing an employee that represents the whole airline should do is to express empathy. Also the whole process would be made much smoother if only the airline could arrange 1 person at the arrival to say we are not going to make our next flight and it is closed or if we should make a run. It doesn't make sense for us to run all the way to the next gate to be given the cold shoulders.

925,D Garnor,Norway,2019-06-10,7,"Budapest to Oslo via Munich. I have mixed feelings about LH's business product. The check-in was ok (this time the BUD 2A terminal was totally empty, nobody was at the LH business check-in desk), the fast track security was ok, but the next step, the lounge was not ok. LH uses the Celebi Platinum Lounge at BUD, and the standard is around middle! Food selection is poor, quality is bad, there is no warm food at all, snack and sweet selection is pretty bad too, so I'd say this looks like rather a premium economy level lounge. I don't know if Celebi or LH upgrades or checks this lounge, but it would need a definite upgrade, cause for the business class ticket price, it was a disappointment. The boarding was ok both at BUD and MUC. On board, it is also a bit strange. The seat is not a business seat, it is an economy seat, only the middle seat left empty, but this is the only good thing one can say about LH's biz class seat. No bigger legroom, no bigger recline comparing to economy. The food is ok, there is no warm food, not even for a MUC-OSL route. The dessert was fine though (in fact it was better than the main course), and the tea was served in a ceramic cup. Bread was ok, butter was ok, though there was no hot towel. The pursers on both routes were kind and helpful. The Lufthansa business lounge in MUC was super, that one would have to be copy-pasted to BUD! And of course, it was nice to have the possibility to check-in two baggage (which this time I did) and to go on board with two handbags (which this time I did). All-in-all, nice flights with minor delay in the first leg, professional and efficient crew. If LH keeps on selling business class tickets on these prices, they'll  have to upgrade their services at some segments!

Sure, there is no PE class on connecting flights, and the distances between gates in FRA are quite long, but I did not see these as major issues. The basic product LH offered really worked for me. The fundamental issue was whether the extra cost for PE is worth it. After seeing that the incremental cost above economy was significant, I would say that it is not worth it.

There are just far too many unacceptable flaws in the product and the process, where I certainly wouldn't repeat this trip.  I thought all crews were professional and capable and the food was better than average. On the negative side, none of the seats were comfortable. They are economy seats with the middle seat free, but in no way compare to overseas business class.  There is no in seat power , no IFE. If AA and others can retrofit aircraft with IFE, wifi and power, Lufthansa can do the same but they have not. The Frankfurt hub of LH and this is the real deal killer. I have not experienced a hub quite this bad in years. It's poorly designed, requires extremely long and awkward walks and transits between terminals, poor signage, massive queues, inadequate staffing, incompetent and rude security and border police personnel. Lufthansa makes zero attempt to help premium passengers through any of these diabolical queues. The highlight of the trip was the Turkish Airlines business class lounge at the new IST airport which is a show stopper and best in class.

As this is a long flight we choose the airplane (wanted newer aircraft for more comfort) and to pay for a premium economy seat to have extra leg room and to be able to choose a window and isle seat so as to have no one next to each other. At the time the reservation and seat bookings were confirmed. 4 months later we noticed on the Lufthansa app that the following changes were made to our reservation without any notification - Our seats had been changed between Bangkok and Munich. (different seats allocated than booked).Our flight time has been bought forward almost 1 hour, aircraft type has been changed (New A350 to old A340 200). The aircraft operator has been changed (from Lufthansa to Sun Express) We then called Lufthansa to ask what and below is the response. First call we are told the flight had been moved to a different airline and we should contact them directly (Sun Express) and that Lufthansa cannot help us any further despite us booking directly with Lufthansa.  2nd call were told that this is a Lufthansa flight but this plane is not listed on there website as an aircraft used. The operator then said it was a different operator and I asked if there are any alternatives. The operator booked us on a later flight same day this time with Lufthansa. However despite asking if we can have similar seats and being told they are available (we were told we could book these afterwards on line) we then see a window and isle seat are not available. 3rd call we are told a window and isle seat is not available and to write a written complaint. At this point we are told this has been caused by a maintenance issue with the original aircraft and other people have also been affected. 4th call (as we still do not have the confirmed booking we paid for) we called again and we are told we can have a window seat but when looking at our confirmation we get allocated 14D and 14E but on the seat map this is a isle and middle seat, not a window seat. 5th call we are once again told our seats can be moved to a window and isle seat and have now been allocated 14A and 14C however when looking at the details on line we understand this may not be a window.

From what I could see it is better to spend the money on the seat rather than PE. I had more legroom than those in PE. The food wasn't great but airline food is always hit and miss. The service from the flight attendants was superb. Nothing was too much trouble.

966,Bob Elliott,United States,2019-04-12,5,"Frankfurt to Valencia. Flying Lufthansa - A good airline. Using anything Digital the worst experience among all airlines.  Lufthansa (And Frankfurt airport) in general is a great airline to fly, with good planes, well maintained, great staff, clean, courteous, and efficient operations. The challenge is their digital experience.  For an airline this large, I am shocked at how bad their web sites and APPS are. The speed is so slow that I feel I am back in the days of dial-up service. They seem to have layered so many pages on top of one another, that when you click on a button, you wait 10 to 15 seconds for the next page to load. Then, when you think you have it loaded, some other layer loads on top, and moves the screen so you have to search for what you were just doing. I recently booked a simple flight from Frankfurt to Valencia, and it took me over 30 minutes to book online. I then tried the APP - couldn't eventually book it in the APP because I kept getting kicked out. I don't know if this is because of internet security requirements, or whether it is because the people that designed the Lufthansa internet and APPS are incompetent.

For example my meal included a salad that only had the leaf in it, no tomato or other vegetables that usually belong in a salad. For my chicken I thought they served me tofu because it was just some white cubes of something dumped into some sauce without even bothering to mix them together.

983,R Jano,Romania,2019-02-19,5,"Miami to Munich. How Lufthansa is a 5 star airline has always baffled me but this time I really got the confirmation. I will not blame them for the 3 hours we spent on the plane before departing on our outwards trip (MUC-MIA), there was heavy snowfall in Munchen and we had to wait for the runways to be cleared and the plane to be deiced. However, during those 3 hours there was no service at all. I wasn't expecting much, but a glass of water would have been nice though. Now, the A380s cabin is seriously outdated. And even though it's clear that the plane we flew on recently underwent a C-check, being repainted in the new livery, the didn't bother retrofitting the cabin, so you get a 10 year old in-flight entertainment system. The touch screen barely works, it's slow to respond and responds only to every 3rd of 4th command. And on the inbound leg (MIA-MUC) the control keys (volume, channel, reading lights) didn't work at all. The IFE also froze and reset several times. On the outbound flight some passengers had the IFE not working at all and although they announced on the PA systems that they reset it several times, it didn't solve the problem. We also landed with the cabin light on (they should have been turned down) due to the same electrical problem. The seats are quite uncomfortable and the pitch in economy is just bearable and there are large metal containers protruding in the leg area. I have flown on low cost airlines which had the same seat pitch. There were no amenity kits provided, which if I'm not mistaken, should be provided by a 5 star airline, even in economy (I have flown on ones that do). The food is also nothing to brag about, it's half decent but certainly expected more from such a prestigious airline. On our backward trip the crew arrived late (but again, not their fault since there was an accident and a traffic jam), however the boarding process was a total mess. People aligned according to their seat numbers, but then they decided to randomly close lanes and just board people wherever. There wasn't even a boarding announcement, just for first and business class. When they started boarding Economy and Economy Premium they just opened two random lanes. This meant that no one really knew what's going on and the random boarding made the boarding time unnecessarily long for such a large plane (people in the back which should have been first ended up waiting for people in the front to sit down, who should have been boarded last).

995,Dennis Campbell,Austria,2019-01-26,1,"The complaint is not with the flight itself but rather with horrible post-flight service. And attitude. Snowstorm in Europe. Budapest departure delayed. Thus missed connecting LH MUC-DEN flight. Rebooked LH MUC-ORD-DEN. 2-hour wait. Boarded LH MUC-DEN. Told we had to wait at gate for people arriving from Greece. LH MUC-ORD departure thus delayed nearly 2 hours. Long time to sit on the plane. Thus, missed UA ORD-DEN connecton. At LH service desk in ORD, discovered my wife had been booked by MUC LH on LH ORD-LAX, not ORD-DEN. LH ORD told us only choice was to take AA flight next morning to DEN. As that was the only choice that LH offered, we accepted. LH put us up in a distant rather basic hotel. Arrived at AA (Terminal 3) early next morning to check in. Long line. Denied boarding. AA said LH incorrectly booked our AA tickets. We have to go to LH in Terminal 1 to sort it out. Thus missed AA flight. Arrived at LH in Terminal 1 and told they would not open for 8 hours. Went to UA, they tried to help. There was a UA flight at 8.45 to DEN. Why didnt LH book us on that instead of AA. UA called LH to get OK to write the ticket (Hey, Star Alliance, right?). LH agrees but disconnected before transaction completed. UA agent calls again. Starts to tell story, disconnect. Calls again, starts to tell story, disconnect. Finally he is able to tell the story and again request OK to issue ticket. LH says: NO! No? Yes, no. You have to go back to AA (Terminal 3) and ask AA to reissue the ticket to UA. But, wait, there is no valid AA ticket. That is the problem. In any event, if we go back to AA, we will miss the UA flight. So I buy the tickets, and I will ask LH to reimburse. UA prints out receipt and says surely LH will reimburse. After all, if the LH agent in ORD had been paying attention, he would have issued a ticket on UA and not AA in the first place. However, now, LH says no refund. Not even for goodwill. We have received off letters from LH about this. LH says the wait for passengers in MUC, the misbooking of my wife to LAX instead if DEN, the failure by the LH agent in ORD to find to the UA connection to DEN, and the improperly issued AA tickets in ORD were all due to bad weather in Europe. It took us 42 hours to get to DEN. I will try to avoid using LH in the future. The ground staff was incompetent and uncaring.

Through the entire ordeal the stewardesses were fantastic and patient as people were frustrated.

1028,Cheryl Lum,United States,2018-11-26,7,"San Francisco to Munich. First time my son and I decided to try flying in Premium Economy as we were flying with Lufthansa. In short, it isn't worth the money we spent. It was more comfortable than flying in Economy for the extra legroom, but it's nothing special. Differences between Economy and PE are that the meals are served on chinaware and one sits 55 plus rows in front of Economy, there is a complimentary bottle of water included as well as a small amenity kit with typical items. The kit has 'Cerruti 1861' on it not Lufthansa and was just okay. They serve a pre-flight drink (only orange juice) which I think should be varied. The drinks they serve with snacks or with meals are not individual mini wine bottles but from a large bottle. British Airways and Air France serve wine in individual mini bottles so prefer that better. The service was fine. We had very friendly flight attendants both on the outbound and inbound flights. Food was tasty. However, there are just two choices: Meat dish or pasta. And the portions are as small as a frozen meal. Everything was tiny from the tray to the chinaware. Bread rolls were at least warm but again tiny. The flight attendants put out snacks in the galley but one had to either know beforehand to expect them or just happen to walk past the toilets then notice them as there was no announcement made nor on the menu they handed out. However, the choices were either crackers, Lindt chocolates, and juices and water. Seating as mentioned above is roomy for legroom and a tiny bit widthwise. I found it problematic to recline. In fact, I could not figure out how to do so. And the tray table is folded so it is a bit of a nuisance to unfold and fold it back into the arm rest. If I weren't sitting next to my son I'd need to ask my seat mate if I could disturb them as this tray table folding/unfolding experience necessitated bothering one's seat mate's arm rest too. Worst part of the experience is that the toilets were only two for the entire PE section and they were filthy. Plus the crew seem to be stingy on toilet roll replacing. In fact, they only have one toilet roll from the beginning of the flight. Sometimes it ran out with no replacement timely. Also hand soap ran out and it took some time for them to refill it. I've flown British Airways and Air France which have bad aspects, however, at least their flight attendants were always replacing missing toiletry items regularly during the long flight. This was a connecting flight between Munich and Rome. Hated that we were not told that upon arrival in Rome we'd be landing on the tarmac and would need to take a shuttle bus to the terminal. It was cold and windy and frankly hard to maneuver the steps from the plane for me. Would hate to have an infant and/or small children in tow. All in all, I'd have to think hard if I want to spend another $2K for Lufthansa's PE in future. I just didn't feel it was worthwhile as it was not much different from sitting in Economy. In fact, they make it known that you're really in Economy as you have no special boarding privileges either; you enter with all of the Economy passengers.",A380-800,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Munich,November 2018,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,,2,yes,False,San Francisco,Munich,,Positive,0.7144,  san francisco munich first time son decide try fly premium economy fly short worth money spend comfortable fly economy extra legroom nothing special difference economy pe meal serve chinaware one sit 55 plus row front economy complimentary bottle water include well small amenity kit typical item kit 1861 okay serve drink orange juice think varied drink serve snack meal individual mini wine bottle large bottle airway air france serve wine individual mini bottle prefer good service fine friendly attendant outbound inbound flight food tasty however two choice meat dish pasta portion small frozen meal everything tiny tray chinaware bread roll least warm tiny attendant put snack galley one either know beforehand expect happen walk past toilet notice announcement make menu hand however choice either cracker lindt chocolate juice water seat mention roomy legroom tiny bit widthwise find problematic recline fact figure tray table fold bit nuisance unfold fold back arm rest sit next son need ask seat mate disturb tray table experience necessitate bother one seat mate arm rest bad part experience toilet two entire pe section filthy plus crew seem stingy toilet roll replace fact one toilet roll begin sometimes ran replacement timely hand soap run take time refill fly airway air france bad aspect however least attendant always replace miss toiletry item regularly long connect munich rome hat upon arrival rome landing tarmac need take shuttle bus terminal cold windy frankly hard maneuver step hate infant small child tow think hard want spend another 2k pe future feel worthwhile much different sit economy fact make know really economy special boarding privilege either enter economy passenger

Accommodation was covered during my stay in the host country and I was clear in the original letter of invitation that I have shown him. He seemed convinced after what I have said and he left.

1040,L Drüschner,Germany,2018-11-12,4,"Hanover to Beijing via Munich. Flight HAJ to CKG via MUC/PEK, and return flight CKG to HAJ via SHA-PVG/MUC. Online booked at Lufthansa, the flight PEK-CKG was carried out as part of the Star Alliance by Air China with a LH flight number. In Hannover the luggage was labeled to CKG. I asked if the luggage had to be picked up in Beijing and re-boarded to CKG, I did not receive conclusive information in Hanover and at the boarding gate in Munich. The lady at the boarding gate in Munich has looked in the PC, but she was not able to give a conclusive answer. She just gave the advice to ask in Beijing! On my objection that I do not speak Chinese, she said that at the jetway when leaving the plane there are always someone with English language skills. That was not the case. Then, as a precaution, I waited for my suitcase on the luggage belt, which then came. The food of the flight section MUC-PEK can be classified as problematic. The first leg of the return flight, which I took with my wife, was done by Air China. The first leg was delayed by 1:40 hours due to fog in CKG. We had to fear for our connection in Shanghai, because an airport change from Shanghai Hongqiao to Pudong (around 60 km) was necessary. When we made our online booking only a terminal change was indicated for Shanghai. Later it was changed in an airport change. Air China was unable to obtain any assistance because of the delay. Then there was an altercation at the check-in CKG because of the number of luggage (2 pieces each 23 kg per person). Air China wanted to carry only 1 piece with 20 kg/person. Furthermore, it was forgotten to enter the passport number on my wife's boarding pass, as soon as the next trouble occurred at the security checkpoint.

Air Nostrum is a substandard low cost airline, normally operating on behalf of Iberia. Not even a Star Alliance partner. There was zero service onboard. Flight attendants were rude.

Athens saw 3 gate changes, no big deal, no information as which terminal arrival would be, which carousel baggage could be collected from or any ground staff to assist with the immigration maze. I’m not stupid, but today I felt completely lost at Frankfurt Airport. The scary part is somehow I made it out. I have no idea how I managed that as not one person could or would assist. Not good enough Lufthansa. And the part I’m not looking forward to is my departure from Frankfurt Airport next week. Heaven help me, as no person at that airport will! Unacceptable by any measure.

I booked our ticket with this airline and was hoping my longer leg which was from San Jose to Frankfurt to be upgraded to Premium which I bet for. I had an option to submit my credit card now or later, which I did. Usually they send you an email to confirm that you have been selected and charge your credit card. A day before my trip I was notified that did not win the upgrade to premium economy. But at the same time find out that I have been upgraded the shorter distance to business class for 2 seats for $1500. I was in state of shock and panicked since this was not in my agenda. Right away contacted Lufthansa Customer Service and after being on phone to get connected for 45 minutes, I requested this is a mistake and very nicely asked them to correct and credit back my money. The customer service agent was very rude and not helpful and said this is a done deal and he cannot do anything. He said I can go to ticket counter and see if they can do any thing. I did write few emails and showed my concern and requested correct of action. At the same time I approached the ticket counter in San Jose and the agent was very nice and after 45 minutes trying to connect to Lufthansa customer service, he apologized that could not get anywhere and asking me to try in Germany’s customer service ticket counter. I did the same thing and the rude agents in Germany by twisting my statement and putting 100 percent blame on me asked me to use the deal or lose everything (meaning lose your money and seats). I told them I preferred not to use the business portion since I can not do anything afterwards. She responded use it or lose it. So you see how I started my trip, with anxiety. After 3 month and 5 emails and phone calls finally I got a phone call from customer service telling me they can not do anything since I used the ticket and offered me $200.

The inflight entertainment system on the trans-Atlantic flights had a decent selection of movies and music, but my screen kept freezing and crashing, and had to be reset, on both long-haul flights. The food on the EWR-FRA segment was okay, but the chicken meal on the FRA-EWR flight was absolutely horrible. Decent bar service on both long-hauls though. The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful. I just barely made it to the gate a few minutes before they closed the doors. My already short connection was made even shorter due to the fact that the flight from Vienna landed what seemed like several miles from the actual terminal, and we were then treated to a 15-minute bus tour of Frankfurt airport, so I ended up literally having to run all the way to my next gate.

The pilot announced several times that the flights from Frankfurt were also delayed and not to worry. Nevertheless, we ran as quickly as possible to make our connection to Philadelphia. The gate agents practically laughed at us and said that flight was long gone. The truth was we arrived at our gate at 1:45pm, the flight was delayed until 2:10pm (according to an email I received from Lufthansa) and did not actually take off until 2:30pm (according to FlightAware). Yet, Lufthansa did nothing to get us on that plane (I assume it was out on the tarmac - the busing around the Frankfurt airport to and from the planes is ridiculous). Instead, we had to go to customer service and were re-booked on a flight the following day. Customer service actually seemed annoyed that they had to deal with us. Then to make matters worse, the customer service rep said they would book us at a nice hotel in center city so we could see Frankfurt. The hotel was no where near center city - we were in some warehouse district that was not walking distance to anything. To get to center city was a walk and two bus rides away or a 40 euro round trip taxi ride. Ridiculous! The extra 24 hours in Frankfurt was awful and I couldn't wait to get out of there.

1089,J Main,United Kingdom,2018-08-18,1,". I booked to fly with Lufthansa from London to Zagreb via Frankfurt on a Wednesday evening. The check-in staff told me that the first flight was delayed so I would miss the connection. The impression was this was very much my problem and I should speak to the reservations line. Reservations changed me to a flight via Vienna to stay the night in a hotel courtesy of the airline and fly to Zagreb early the next day. I was satisfied with this. I asked the check-in staff whether I should get the hotel voucher from them or from Vienna airport - they were clear that I should collect this from the Austrian Airlines representative at Vienna airport. On arrival at Vienna I was told by the Austrian Airlines representative that Lufthansa had put no information on their system relating to my needing accommodation for the night. They spent 20 minutes trying to contact Lufthansa reservations and were not able to - on speaking to a representative at the Frankfurt Lufthansa headquarters the Austrian Airlines rep was told ""that's not my responsibility"". There was a pop concert on in Vienna - there were no rooms or only rooms with inflated prices available and I could not afford the cost of a taxi to/from the city and a hotel myself. I approached two hotels in walking distance who told me they had rooms only accessible with a voucher. Austrian Airlines would not provide me with a voucher without Lufthansa indicating on their system that this was agreed. The rep apologised for the experience I was having due to Lufthansa but was  unable to act without their ticking a box on the system.  I spent the night on the floor of the airport.  I emailed Lufthansa that night expressing my frustration and requesting compensation.

1090,D Colloun,United States,2018-08-17,8,"Florence to Bangkok via Frankfurt. I sent this note to customer service because of the sweetheart that helped me get home. After a delayed flight from Sofia to Frankfurt, I missed my connection back to Florence which in and of itself would not be a problem if I did not have another flight the very next day from Rome to Bangkok, ironically connecting in Frankfurt again. The flight was not on the same booking as I had taken a last minute trip to Bulgaria and felt comfortable giving myself one day in Florence before my flight back to Bangkok. What would have been a few busy days of traveling quickly turned into a nightmare. After a long walk to terminal B to the transfer counter, which I could not find and was not clearly marked, me and hundreds of other frustrated and tired customers got in line. Standing there I realized that I could potentially miss my return flight to Bangkok the next day because of a one hour delay; my best laid plans were ruined. As I inched forward slowly to the front of the line, I could see the agitated groups of people huffing and puffing about their misfortune. I started to feel a tinge of panic too. Standing in the very front I looked at the flashing number and approached the counter. I was greeted with a welcoming smile and cheerful voice. Already an amazing feat as far as I was concerned seeing the amount of verbal abuse that was going on at the counters while I was waiting. This immediately put me more at ease. I explained my predicament: If the earliest flight from Frankfurt to Florence landed at 9:30, I would not get home to get my other bag and drop off the keys to my friend's apartment until at least 10:30, it's a 30 minute walk to the train station and a taxi is not much quicker then I would have to hope there was a train right away. If my some twist of fate I got an 11:15 train, I'd be at Rome central station at 12:45 and then have to hope again there was a coinciding train to the airport just at that moment which would get me there around 1:30pm for a 2:55pm flight and that is if absolutely everything went my way carrying two pieces of luggage in the hot August sun. Maybe some daredevils think that is plenty of time but I'm a traveler that arrives 3 hours early for every flight. Just thinking about that time frame was causing me stress. The friendly woman behind the counter listened and empathized with a smile. She could have just told me that even though both flights were with Lufthansa because they were on different bookings that there was nothing she could do. She could have politely told me that the 8:30am flight was the best she could do or brushed off my concerns and turned her attention to the hundreds of people behind me. But instead she really took my case as a whole, as a human being with a problem that she could help solve.

1114,G Zhang,Switzerland,2018-07-31,1,"I intended to take a flight from Basel to Munich and transfer to another one to Split. The original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes, which is more than enough. However, the boarding time was delayed twice as I was waiting in Basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. So I asked the front desk what should I do in order to catch my second plane, and she  couldn't give a useful answer, saying you should be able to catch it. As I got on board, I asked the crew several times about whether there is a fast track for transfer and whether they have further information about my second device. All the feedback I got was ""I couldn't give any information"" and ""sorry we don't have the device to check"". By the time I get off the plane, I still have five minutes to catch up. However, I have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. This is simply no way for me to speed up. I ran  but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. So I have to go to the service center for the rebook. But the queue is super long. They only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people.  And the officials didn't even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. This isn't my first experience of a tight transfer so I do have some example to compare. I remember when I took a Swiss airline from Beijing to Zurich, the plane was late due to frost for two hours. However, during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew. And as soon as I arrived at the Zurich airport, there are officials guiding us how to go and the transfer was really fast. Eventually everyone was happy about it.

At the Frankfurt hub, the transfer waited for us at the gate, giving it somewhat of a delay, maybe 20 min's or so.

Lufthansa kept improving and catching up the last couple of years though. I think now they did it and my last experience was just outstanding as I flew Munich to Seoul with business class. The plane was a brand new A350-900. A mattress has been provided and a Pyjama that made the flight very comfortable. The entertainment was massively improved: at least twice as much movies and programs have been added to system, that contains interactive maps. Last but not least, and which is most important was the crew. The crew was not only very professional (which is state of the art @ Lufthansa) but attentive. Even though the level of Singapore Airlines or Emirates is not reached yet but the Lufthansa crew kept taking care of the passengers the whole flight. Lufthansa merits the 5 star rating if all flights would have the same level as I experienced during this one. To be improved is the seat though. It is too tight, too inclined and lacks of storage capacities and electronics connections. I heard that Lufthansa is working on that.

1125,C Dawes,Canada,2018-07-16,10,"Victoria-Vancouver-Frankfurt-Geneva on 24 April 2018, returning 10 May. Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options – vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone LH to ask for the Air Canada booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.","Dash 8-Q400, Boeing 747-400, CRJ-700, A319",Business,Economy Class,Victoria to Geneva via Vancouver-Frankfurt,April 2018,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,4,yes,True,Victoria,Geneva,Vancouver-Frankfurt,Positive,0.7823,  24 april 2018 return 10 may economy class book website advance seat selection intercontinental segment mainline lh flight use boeing connect flight air canada use dash turboprop connect flight customarily book premium economy 747s four row seat pe seat leave front bulkhead row worth cost front row although extra knee room ca stretch leg fully seat front well armrest tray table ife screen half size screen pe seat book regular economy class seat 49a outbound 48k return book window seat cost 49 way worth let stretch legs fully seat front fas good two meal serve main one second 90 minute land meal lh two standard economy stodge option vegetarian pasta chicken second meal omelette midday arrival fra beef stew pasta afternoon arrival yvr connection offer lh website tight two hour way fra nevertheless luggage arrive time hitch lh ac use different book code book trip lh website telephone lh ask air canada book code need order initial yyj

1127,B Harbon,United States,2018-07-12,5,"Los Angeles to Malta via Munich last month, then back via Munich. Although Lufthansa's boarding procedures are wonky and our flight was late as a result, once on board Lufthansa, I never really have any complaints. The food is decent, drinks plentiful, and seats are about as comfortable (uncomfortable) as you would expect. Lots of in-flight entertainment options, which is good. The way back through Munich was a mess. For whatever reason we couldn't check in online. We called and were told we could check in at the airport the next morning at the airport to get our boarding passes, then do the same again once we were in Munich. This went OK for the first short flight, but horrible for the connection. The Lufthansa service desk in Munich wouldn't print our passes and sent us to the gate without alerting anyone. Lufthansa has an extra security check-in before the gate, and those employees didn't want to let us through without a boarding pass. This resulted in about twenty minutes of additional delay with three other confused Lufthansa employees. We finally made it to the gate where we were then reprimanded by another Lufthansa employee for being late for boarding. She refused to sit my husband and I together (?), so we were placed in separate aisles. Once on board the flight, the seat I had been given was in between a woman and her two children. She asked me to move, which I did. The row behind my husband's assigned seat was almost empty, so we ended up sitting there together.

1130,J Luemer,Germany,2018-07-08,7,"I was travelling from QKL (Cologne Central Station) to CPH (Copenhagen) with Lufthansa via FRA (Frankfurt). The first leg of this trip was operated by Lufthansa Air Rail, which is a train service. While Miles&More Senators/HON and Lufthansa Business Class customers are allowed to use the DB Lounge at Cologne Central Station, this service is not provided to Star Alliance Gold customers. Still, I find the 50-minutes train ride from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt a very convenient alternative compared to flying. What I do not like is that there are no check-in agents at Cologne Station anymore – they have been replaced by a check-in machine. So it is not possible to make changes to the ticket: No change of flights, seats, frequent traveller card or APIS when flying to the US. Security at Frankfurt was very quick and I went directly to the lounge closest to my departure gate in the A terminal (A30). It was a business class lounge and had a really good selection of food and I nice tarmac view. It even had showers (which I did not use). I found it better that the Senator Lounges. The flight from FRA to CPH was fully booked in Economy, so no free middle seat. Nice crew, a bite to eat and two drink services (1h15m flight!). All in all a good experience.

No free internet in the cabin, you need to pay same as a economy passenger. Seats the same and service not so different than the economy cabin.

1133,G Pagalopolis,Greece,2018-07-04,1,"Athens to Hamburg via Munich, returning from Frankfurt in 0April. The food was mediocre to bad, the service was, overall (although there were a couple of notable exceptions), mechanical or indifferent (at best), sometimes bordering on downright rude. Once the food was served, on all 4 flights (with the partial exception of FRA-ATH), service was non-existent. We were not proactively offered anything (drink, etc) on flight ATH-MUC, the curtain between Business and Economy was left open for most of the flight, with the result that the Business class lavatory was used by people from Economy. None of the cabin crew tried to stop them. Surely one of the benefits of flying a Business class cabin is to have a dedicated bathroom? The boarding process was chaotic - any notion of priority boarding was a joke. On 1 flight by the time we boarded, other passengers had filled the storage space. Since we were seated at seats 2D and 2F, where we had no option but to store everything in the overhead lockers, I believe that someone should have made sure that people on the other rows stored things under the middle (empty) seats. To his credit, the steward very kindly helped us find a solution - no pre-flight drinks were offered, on one flight no menus were offered. We were offered a choice of ""meat"" or ""paella"".

1139,Sid Vinyard,United States,2018-06-28,4,"Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt. Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrée selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival.

1140,S Ganusharan,United States,2018-06-28,1,"Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. One of the worst customer service you will experience. Myself and my 15 month old daughter are traveling from Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. When we reached the airport, they checked in the bag and when they checked the passport, they found that my wife cannot travel as there is a new rule that if you have a layover in Frankfurt, we need a valid schengen visa or a US stamped visa. We told Lufthansa that you never told us anything while booking the tickets or even when i called them to pay for the seat allotment as Lufthansa charges person for getting the bassinet seat (Most other airlines provide it free if you book the flight with infant). Lufthansa just want to get the money from you and never provide any information. The person at the check in counter said it is in our website and i asked him to show it, he went and wandered for 15 minutes and said he lost the sheet which had that information. I checked their website and nothing says about the rule. They mention that if you have two layover within Europe you need schengen visa, but not for a single layover within Frankfurt. And the person in the counter said, if you have booked the ticket through Lufthansa, the customer service should provide me alternate route. So, i called the customer service as i booked the flight through Lufthansa.com. When i called Lufthansa customer service, they told me that they cannot do anything apart from cancelling (which i dont get any refund) or postpone the flight to some other day so that i can go and get schengen visa. I am speaking to them saying getting schengen visa takes days and my wife and daughter has to travel within couple of days. The customer service person said they cannot do anything. So, i went back to the check in counter and the person over there called the supervisor who made a call to customer service of Lufthansa and explained the situation. Lufthansa finally said they can put us in another flight with a huge layover everywhere and also it cost us $1500 more as it is considered as one way flight and we need to pay from our pocket. I have been going through all this mess in the airport and took almost 4 hours with the 15 month old baby sitting in the airport. I decided not to fly with Lufthansa as they treated really really bad and went to Qatar Airways and flew with them, who provided excellent care for the baby and myself. But Lufthansa didnt stop there, they charged me extra for missing the flight and also charged me more as my return flight is with Lufthansa. So, i ended by paying more than $3500 for the entire flight from Detroit to Chennai and my return flight. The person in the check in counter said, they see same scenario everyday (at least 2 people every day). Lufthansa is  making free money from 2 people at just one airport and i am imagining how much money they make from all the airport around the world. They charge people when they knew that they cannot fly and also charge them more whey they miss the flight due to Lufthansa mistake. While booking the ticket, why cannot Lufthansa mention this. Lufthansa mention that you need to have a valid schengen visa is there is multiple layover within Europe. If you can say that, why cannot Lufthansa say that if you don't have a valid US visa or a Schengen visa you cannot have a layover in Frankfurt. Lufthansa just want to get the money out of you and don't care about their customer.

When I purchased the ticket, there were flights with either about 45 minute connection time or about 3.5 hour connection time at Munich / Frankfurt airport. 3.5 hour seemed quite long so I chose connecting flights with 45 minute layover. If Lufthansa sells the tickets, the transfer should be possible. In fact, I had less than 30 minutes to transfer as the boarding for the 2nd flight closed 15 minutes prior to the departure. When my first flight arrived in Munich, I had to run. But there were so many people in the queue to go through the security and then passport control. It would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate! But then I realised from the live departure board that my flight to London has departed. As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me. There was a hotel at the airport, Lufthansa should have arranged a room for me there. They should not sell connecting flights with such unrealistic layover time. I tried to complain to Lufthansa, however, their website didn't allow me to do so. So I emailed their customer service. They acknowledged the receipt but I haven't heard from them since then.

We have arrived to Frankfurt airport, check in, passed security control, and we waiting for boarding. 15 minutes before flight they said that flight is canceled and we have to go to a counter. We went to counter. There was long queue. It was approximately 20 flights canceled, due to bad weather. So after 1.5 hour in the queue we have reached counter. Staff was quite rude, they told us to go to another counter in departure area. We went there. There was several times longer queue. Here we spent approximately 5 hours prior to reaching counter. Here staff was more friendly. They put us on waiting list for 8 a.m. flight and give vouchers to hotel. Next morning we have repeated exercise. In boarding area they told us that it is 40 people on waiting list and only two seats, so we have to go back to counter. I ask, is it possible to talk with manager. Answer was quite rude: go to counter and there will be your manager. We run to counter. This time we reach it in 40 minutes. They rebook us on waiting list of 11:50 flight and told us that at noon air dispatchers strike in Italy will start. There I realized that we may reach Florence by some miracle this evening, otherwise we may not get there even till our train to Verona. We decided to change plans and cancel our flights to Florence and from Verona. They told us that we have to go to different counter on second floor. Another hour waiting and we are again in front of window. They told us that here we can only cancel flight, but to start procedure of returning money I have to go to site and feel up some request. They told us that we may get our luggage in half an hour to one hour. Of cause, it took us 2.5 hours to get it. Mean while I feel up that form. It was not from the first attempt that I was able to submit it. To summarize our experience: of cause there could be different circumstances, like weather conditions, strike etc., but it would be good attitude to send manager to each canceled flight area and talk with passengers, figure out their needs, try to find some solutions. Nothing of this was done. In addition to that normal companies did not canceling flights due to temporary weather conditions, just postponing it.

Unfortunately flying it in economy is just awful. I was seated in row 16, the first row of a mini cabin between club and premium economy, where seats are sold at premium prices. The seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong, not a chance to get comfortable. IFE could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could, so gave up on that. The insult after injury was the main meal: a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo! The German kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. Tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why?

1153,K Malcom,United Kingdom,2018-06-12,1,"This is my 3rd bad experience with Lufthansa in the last 3 months and I think I need to share it. I was travelling Business Class from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then to London with a layover in FRA of 1hr 45min. Boarding at ZAG was done without priority boarding. When landing at FRA the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. Not only no separate bus was used for C class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. When I reached Terminal A I had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates B where my flight for LHR was departing from. I have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within Europe, yet Lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. The queue for the security was one of the longest I have ever seen in my life. As a business class passenger and Star Alliance Gold member I attempted to enter the Fast Track. A lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""No"", despite me showing her my C class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. I asked her three times whether Lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""No"". I waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. When I reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. The Lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. There are not a lot of benefits for business class European flights. People pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that Lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. What should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. I have experienced inconsistent and bad service from Lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that I would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.",CRJ1000 / A320,Business,Business Class,Zagreb to London via Frankfurt,June 2018,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,,1,no,True,Zagreb,London,Frankfurt,Positive,0.8506,  3rd bad experience last 3 month think need share travel business class zagreb frankfurt london layover fra 1hr 45min boarding zag do without priority board land fra pilot lose way around airport take 20 minute park remote stand separate bus use c class passenger instead passenger squeeze like sardine one single bus reach terminal walk mile take train make gate b lhr departing never go security transfer travel within europe yet decide send route require security screen queue security one long ever see life business class passenger star alliance gold member attempt enter fast track lady stand entrance refuse entrance say despite show c class board pas gold star alliance card ask three time whether allow passenger use fast track keep tell one single word wait normal security queue 40 minute leave single minute lounge access reach gate boarding start priority boarding use agent open gate say please go passenger run towards lot benefit business class european flight people pay significant additional amount money get couple extra benefit appear refuse specific reason comfortable layover turn nightmare gap nearly 2hrs flight disappear experienced inconsistent bad service ground air another two occasion recently enough say recommend anyone certainly waste money pay business class questionable whether receive benefit

1162,S Varidis,Germany,2018-06-03,6,"Frankfurt to Athens. Staff at Gate was very friendly and helpful. Also the cabin crew worked fast and was very friendly. Unfortunately this aircraft was not prepared for Lufthansa Inflight Entertainment like the most aircrafts of Lufhansa, so it was not possible to use the Lufthansa App that provides several entertainment options. I am really disappointed about the seats. The seat was too thin and too short. All Lufthansa singlle aisle aircrafts have this type of seats. This was not a pleasure as the flight take 2 hours and 30 minutes and I had some pain at the lower back area and thigs. I guess for a shorter flight the seat is ok, but for flight of more than 2 hours it can be very unconfotable to sit on such a seat. The menu/food was ok, the tast more bland than nice. I expect more from a 5 star airline, especaially in business class! There was only one choise of coffee, filter coffee.

This area does not have bassinet fixing positions. The modern seat was as efficient and high-tech as before, really simple to adjust your seat to achieve a variety of positions including lie flat. Service was more friendly this time, though also with a Germanic reserve (none the worse for that!). Dinner was served shortly after departure, and was pleasant enough fare.

Then when I noticed my partner surname was incorrectly recorded, I was advised by their telephone customer services to cancel and rebook, which I did at an additional cost of £400, but again because it was within the first 24 hours, I should have received a full refund (there are still errors recorded in this second booking).

The benefits were obvious, especially when travelling with a little, impatient child - you'll learn to love the fast lane, the lounge (even though the one in PMI is quite disappointing, but it is run by the airport itself and used for every airline), and the priority luggage service (which I never noticed on business trips, as I only had carry-on luggage). We loved the quiet atmosphere in the well booked business class compartment - our daughter had two seats on her own to take a nap almost throughout the entire flight. Service and food onboard were professional and friendly. The surcharge when booking a non flexible business class ticket compared to the available economy tickets was well worth the benefits.

I asked the staff to confirm this information, but she told me that everything was indicated on the ticket, which was not the case since it did not indicate the local time of arrival to Tokyo, so I had to request the information from another staff. Finally, the flight took off later than the scheduled time expected so I was afraid that I could not connect flights on time.

Also, the seat is on a sideways angle, meaning that it's not a natural position in which to sleep in the bed mode, further complicated by the fact that the footwell is very narrow indeed. This is a 2-2-2 configuration and the seats are far too close to each other and lack any real sense of privacy (nor do they have a privacy screen).

1210,Richard Winger,United States,2018-03-06,5,"New York to Berlin in business class. Flights were fine. Security at JFK T1 is always disorganized, with pre check sometimes available and often not. This time, there was  a dedicated lane, I got to pass with shoes on, but, at x ray, the officer suddenly insisted “there is no precheck” and sent my bag to be prodded, examined and swabbed. LH owns a quarter of T1 and so would seem to have a at least a quarter of the responsibility to sort out the chronic security mess. The lounge was overcrowded and under catered, worn and unchanged. Pre flight dining is now a standard expectation for C class transatlantic flights, but here for a 10.30 pm departure, the offer is a bowl of canned vegetables, sadly wilting on a steam table, next to Teriyaki chicken. There are also some chicken wraps, just about edible. The wines are basic. Pre flight at TXL is even worse. Mobile boarding passes must be exchanged for paper at the desk - no obvious reason; the lounge is outside security, shabby, with a flair of filth. At 4pm, when you might want a bite to catch up on a missed lunch, catering consists of pretzel and potato salad. The security line is long and slow, inspection excessively manual.

1219,Stefan Oelze,Germany,2018-02-17,8,"Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.",,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Milan,February 2018,4.0,5.0,2.0,,2.0,,3,yes,True,Frankfurt,Milan,,Positive,0.9468,  whilst proud become first european award 5 star get right logo redesign unfortunately still true situation main hub frankfurt leave lot desire travel every week route milan frankfurt chance board depart via finger directly terminal sometimes bus depart gate newly add terminal part require good 10 min walk get arrive frankfurt almost always mean apron position somewhere tarmac easily 10 min bus drive instance land relatively new runway west taxi take 10 min park position sometimes add wait time bus arrive 10 min get terminal add almost 50 flying time milan crazy frankfurt airport use retire cramped bus local public transport bus company arrive bus passenger get cattled via narrow staircase terminal lucky day two airport employee ipads help gate information generally overwhelm number passenger ask information sometimes connect passenger leave device badly signpost airport area screen provide gate information bad part frankfurt airport provide premium traveler exception hons first class passenger long wait time security schengen area terminal total 3 lounge peak time overcrowd schengen departure terminal b lounge access whatsoever guest three lounge 2 business one alliance gold stand hour cater disappointing offer food leave regular client guess get right second hub munich 2 business lounge total 4 senator london munich hopefully soon malpensa lounge provide much sophisticate food offer compare main hub frankfurt cause difference maybe management responsible travel experience pair passenger follow real travel experience duration frankfurt airport stay help realize whole really

1226,Brice Dallard,Singapore,2018-02-03,2,"Toulouse to Singapore via Frankfurt. The TLS-FRA flight arrived late, leading to miss the connecting flight to SIN and causing me to spend the night in FRA. These things happen, and as a frequent traveler working in the aerospace industry, I'm more understanding than most. However, I was not impressed at all by the way the situation was handled:  no information was given by the crew about the delay of the TLS-FRA leg. We were just stuck in the aircraft, doors closed, and not moving. After asking multiple times, I was told by the FA it was because of fog in FRA. When I proceeded to claim compensation, the airline told me it was because of French Air Traffic Control Strike. Remembering the chaos in FRA airport that evening, I have a hard time believing that. No staff was available to provide assistance once arrived in FRA airport. All customer service desks were closed, even though it was obvious that there was a big mess in FRA. It was impossible to reach the hotline to check for alternative flights. I stayed online for 2 times 45 mns, before giving up. So I organized my own hotel, transportation and meals, and in line with EU regulation 261/2004, I asked the airline to pay for the expense incurred. It has now been 4 months, and I have yet to receive the funds. I received a reply 6 weeks ago telling me the payment has been made, but it never reached my bank account. Now, customer relations department is just playing dead. On the onboard experience itself, I would say that the crew is professional, but rather cold. Food is edible, but I thought below average of other full service airlines. The major issue lies with FRA airport, where connections are very long: I had to walk 35 mns and take a train to reach the other terminal. Security was very long, with only 2 lines open, and rude staff at every checkpoint (passport control, security, boarding gates).

1227,M Kronz,Germany,2018-02-02,4,"Munich to Athens. The points I mention don´t mean much, but in combination they make you wonder why you spent more than the price of an economy class ticket. Outbound flight MUC-ATH (Jan.13th, 2018): I noticed that the Business Class security fast lane at MUC airport was not open. The food in the business lounge at MUC is fine but the same. When boarding the aircraft you used to be addressed by name, not for me. The A321 business cabins have a fixed tray table across the middle seat which is very awkward for sitting down and getting up when you have a window seat. An economy class passenger stowed his hand luggage in the business class overhead compartment. No welcome drink, and announcements in German and English, no Greek.  The onboard choice of meals consisted of two main courses, the one I chose I found inedible.

To say we were irritated would be an understatement. The flight was extremely full and there was barely space to put our hand luggage. We felt sympathy for the cabin crew as they were clearly exhausted, having to work on Christmas Eve on an evening flight. On our return flight, check-in was super quick but boarding was quite chaotic though relatively speedy in the end. We again had our seats changed but it was to the emergency exit row. We transited at MUC before continuing on to LHR. Nothing pretty remarkable for such a short flight. Overall, Lufthansa do well in terms of seat comfort but the food is quite repetitive.

1237,Andreas Becker,Germany,2018-01-11,9,"As a German I used Lufthansa quite regularly and during the last few years I was never happy with the value for money of my home carrier. That started to change from 2016 and now I have had another great experience with LH. Flown Hannover - Frankfurt - Miami and back Atlanta - Frankfurt in premium economy class. Short flight HAJ to FRA as usual, in time, small snack, nothing special, but its just 40 mins in the air. FRA-MIA on A380 premium economy. Thats very good value for money. Seats are spacious to all sides, IFE monitor is bigger. Cabin is seperated from economy class. Food is economy class food but served on porcelain. They serve two meals on that flights, both of them have beem surprisingly good. Beverage selection and IFE have been good as well. Staff helpful, friendly and professional. Flight was on time. On the way back from Atlanta it was an A340, cabin was not clearly seperate from eco class, but seats and food have the same comfort as on the A380. Flight was also on time. The only negative thing was that both flights have been heavily overbooked. On the way to US they announce at the gate that every business class traveller which would downgrade to premium economy would get 800 Euro. So far so good, but actually the rate difference was 900 Euro per way (at least what I got offered). On the way back they offered all passengers at check in which volunteer to fly next day 800 USD.

1248,Stefaan Meulders,Belgium,2017-12-29,9,"Frankfurt to Mexico. We connected in Frankfurt from a flight coming from Brussels, disembarking this flight we were met by a driver who took us with a Mercedes to the exit nearest to the First Class Terminal. We had to exit the airport and walk about 200 meters; alternatively we could have used a First Class lounge in the airport but we preferred the First Class Terminal. The First Class Terminalwas a good choice as it is just fabulous. I also had sufficient time to take a shower (accompanied with a First Class Terminal duck). About 20 minutes before departure an agent took us to the Mercedes that drove us directly to the plane. With a dedicated elevator we went up close to the first class entrance of the plane. Seating in the nose of the Boeing 747-8i is very spacious and comfortable. The seat converts into a flat bed and you can raise a privacy screen. Soon after takeoff caviar was served which is one of the highlights of a Lufthansa first class flight. Soon some appetizers were served followed by the main course. There were 4 options for the main course; duck (which I’m not fond of), a beef stew (also not my favourite), a vegetarian option (pappardelle) or fish. Since fish was the only option I was attracted to I took it. The fish was ‘loup de mer’, presentation was rather uninspired and the taste was extremely salt. Luckily the cheese and dessert trolley had some very good options and all was served very professionally by the crew which was one of the best and most dedicated I ever had. Champagnes and wines were not the most well renowned names as with some other airlines but the quality was extremely good and typical for the regions/varieties. Just before landing the crew came to say us goodbye personally. We landed on time in MEX and were welcomed by a Lufthansa representative holding a board with our names. The representative took us directly to the diplomatic passport immigration desks. Next we went to the luggage belt where our HON labelled luggage was already standing in front of the belt.

The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt.

1267,K Stone,Italy,2017-12-02,2,"Budapest to Venice via Munich. The first flight from Budapest departed with 20-30 mins of delay. This is ok as delays can occur and the duration was rather short. However, arrival in Munich was also delayed in turn by 20-30 mins. The connection in Munich was known in advance to be short, for which reason it is expected that the airline has foreseen how to manage this flight combination. Instead this connection was managed very poorly. Arrival in Munich airport took place at the gate area K, while the connecting flight (to Venice) was at gate area G. This, according to the screen indication itself, requires 17 mins of transfer time. Upon arrival, I noticed on the screen that the connecting flight was already boarding. After taking the shuttle train (needed for this transfer) and running the rest of the way, I arrived at the gate only to discover that the flight was gone. It seems nobody bothered to advise that there was somebody on the way, and hopefully the plane could wait for a mere 10 mins. Offering a connection implies that it is reasonably managed. In spite of the short connection in this case, it seems the airline makes it even worse by setting flights at different areas and not advising of people in transfer. I would never ask a plane with all passengers to wait for a long time, but I do not believe 10 mins would be an issue for anyone. After the above experience, I went to the service desk for help, where I was told that there is ""fortunately another flight tonight"". That meant at 22:00 vs. the original 15:30 that I missed. To illustrate the staff's further lack of customer service, I was told I am eligible for a voucher since I will spend a long time at the airport. I was given a voucher for 10 euros. After indicating that a 10-euro voucher does not seem exactly a correct response from the airline for the trouble caused, I was told that maybe it was a system error, and after a second check, the staff confirmed that in fact I am eligible for 17 euro. I did not continue the discussion as it would have been a waste of time. The above service gives me an impression that the airline simply does not care. In fact it feels like a joke. In any case, I would have expected a much different treatment for a company with a German origin and reputation.

But as soon as we landed and I switched on my phone I had an email stating that I was booked on the later 22:05 flight to Dresden. Facing a 4 hour wait at the airport I went to the very busy Lufthansa service desk where I asked if I could use their airport lounge.

1287,D Kemp,United States,2017-10-18,1,"✅ Verified Review   Newark-Liberty Intl to Munich, LH0413, 18 Sept 2017. I did not expect something elegant or sophisticated from Lufthansa, but their service was appalling. The flight was delayed due to ""late arrival of the plane"". Quite worn out plane, not much of a welcome on board, dim light in the cabin did not make me feel bad in the beginning but definitely was not comforting. I do not mind not smiling FA's if the level of service is high. On this flight, I learned for the first time what means lousy service in business class, definitely not expected from 4-star airline. Frugal menu had one appetizer (salad) with no other choices. I chose fish for the main course which was greasy, overly salty and poorly presented. Everything came on the same tray. During the meal, no drink refills were offered (I had regular coke), so I had to ask for a favor. After I asked for the tray to be taken away, FA took it and asked me to throw the tablecloth and serviette on top of the tray. I expected a dessert would have been offered but was wrong. So again I had to ask for one. Not happy with my request, FA asked what I wanted and finally brought a portion of fruits which was placed on the table without any preparation. After such ""feast"" I tried to sleep but the seat was (though full flat) bumpy and extremely narrow even for me (I am a slim person). So the only comfortable position was lying on my side. Finally, I was able to fall asleep but was awaken soon by the noise from the galley where FAs were loudly talking without lowering their voices. About 1 hour before landing I asked for breakfast. It was not served right away, so the seatbelt sign came on. FA told me that now the breakfast could not be served. No single positive emotion during the whole flight. Extremely lousy service is only memorable thing about Lufthansa. My flight back with United (Polaris business class) was a pleasant surprise – frankly, I expected the opposite for these two carriers. Lesson learned: Lufthansa’s business is an awkward decoration of a comfort+ class with a flatbed (though very uncomfortable). Given the price for the ticket (almost 9 thousand US $), I will choose Lufthansa only if there is absolutely no alternative.",,Business,Business Class,Newark to Munich,September 2017,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1,no,False,Newark,Munich,,Positive,0.9681,  verify review intl munich lh0413 18 sept 2017 expect something elegant sophisticated service appal delay due late arrival quite worn much welcome board dim light cabin make feel bad begin definitely comfort mind smile fa level service high learn first time mean lousy service business class definitely expect frugal menu one appetizer salad choice choose fish main course greasy overly salty poorly present everything come tray meal drink refill offer regular coke ask favor ask tray take away fa take ask throw tablecloth serviette top tray expect dessert offer wrong ask one happy request fa ask want finally bring portion fruit place table without preparation feast try sleep seat though full flat bumpy extremely narrow slim person comfortable position lie side finally able fall asleep awaken soon noise galley fa loudly talk without lower voice 1 hour landing ask breakfast serve right away seatbelt sign come fa breakfast serve single positive emotion whole extremely lousy service memorable thing back united polaris business class pleasant surprise frankly expect opposite two carrier lesson learned business awkward decoration class flatbed though uncomfortable give price ticket almost 9 thousand us choose absolutely alternative
1288,P Goener,Netherlands,2017-10-18,4,"✅ Verified Review   Amsterdam to Addis Ababa via Frankfurt. The onboard service is above average and the legroom is good. However, I had booked to leave on August 25th. On arrival at Schiphol the flight was canceled. Overbooking on another flight was not possible, everything was full. Other flights to Frankfurt departed that evening. Also on Saturdays there was only place on flights with at least three stops and a journey time which was twice as long as planned. Then only one flight took 2 days (!) Later, which cost me 2 days. Cancellation can happen and the fact that there were no good alternatives was not to blame Lufthansa. Where I can admit that Lufthansa does not wish to pay my claim. They indicate that the flight was canceled by the weather conditions. That's strange if you take into account that this was the only flight that was canceled that night, KLM just left Frankfurt. One could easily leave with a delay of an hour or so. Now, in addition to the lack of working hours, I have to make expenses to get what I am entitled to. So service on board 8.5, handling complaints a 2 - the staff is friendly, average 4.2 so. DUTCH: De service aan boord is bovengemiddeld en de beenruimte is goed. Echter ik had geboekt om op 25 augustus te vertrekken. Bij aankomst op schiphol was de vlucht geannuleerd.

Ook op zaterdag was er enkel plaats op vluchten met minimaal drie stops en een reisduur welke twee keer zo lang was als gepland. Toen maar een vlucht 2 dagen(!) later genomen wat mij 2 dagen werktijd kostte ter plekke. Annuleren kan gebeuren en ook het feit dat men geen goede alternatieven had is Lufthansa niet te verwijten. Waar ik mij wel aan kan ergeren dat Lufthansa niet mijn claim wenst te betalen. Zij geven aan dat de vlucht geannuleerd was door de weercondities. Dat is vreemd als je in ogenschouw neemt dat dit de enigste vlucht was die geannuleerd werd die avond,KLM vertrok gewoon wel naar Frankfurt.

1289,G Wang,United States,2017-10-17,2,"✅ Verified Review   Athens to Vancouver via Munich. Despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from Munich to Vancouver, our experience was frustrating, flat out disappointing. We could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. Error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online, your name, ticket number etc may be incorrect, and your routing does not match your ticket. Error messages were different every time we tried so you didn’t know what exactly was the reason. We were questioning whether he even had a ticket. Called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 24/7. We had to wait. Tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. Had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly int’l roaming charges for calls. Original gate from ATH-MUN was rather close to our MUN-YVR, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. On arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight. Boarding an A330 MUN-YVR was a disaster. Other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. If you’re a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. Passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it. Safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go. Upon arrival into YVR, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in MUN and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. They were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. Total 40hrs. We wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from Lufthansa. It has been 7 days and still no response. ",A330 / A320,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Athens to Vancouver via Munich,October 2017,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,1,no,False,Athens,Vancouver,Munich,Negative,-0.9154,  verify review athens vancouver via munich despite comfortable seat good inflight entertainment premium economy munich vancouver experience frustrate flat disappointing check one 4 traveler online one booking error message unfortunately unable check online name ticket number etc may incorrect rout match ticket error message different every time try know exactly reason question whether ticket call customer service multiple time tell us call tech support open wait tech support advise passenger select randomly manually check airport message show online check avoid undue stress costly int l roaming charge call original gate rather close however need time get go exit custom since mother law unable run arrival gate current change father away connect fight board a330 disaster frequent class boarding first general board everyone include wheelchair passenger season traveler know board orderly fashion back front help prevent backlogs passenger backlogged jet bridge pile back short escalator available passenger carry ons use safety issue bunch people way bottom escalator get place go upon arrival yvr advise checked baggage make connection mun advise deliver bag follow evening deliver promise follow evening deliver another 12 hour later follow morning total 40hrs write email customer relation right online check fiasco email warrant response 7 day still response

1306,S Lantanova,Austria,2017-09-26,5,"✅ Verified Review   I was flying from Nice to Graz via Munich. I found out that the flight was canceled for whatever reason and the replacement was not possible because it was Sunday. We were told that we would be transported to Graz by bus, which would take more than 5 hrs, and if we had any other questions we should go to the service center counter. I went to the counter, where I was told to wait for an hour until the additional information would be available. When I asked them to re-book my flight, they said that the only option would be to go to Vienna and then to figure out by myself how to get to Graz because most probably the company wouldn't reimburse me the money for the trip from Vienna Airport to Graz. I went back to the gate, got a 10-euro voucher, and was told to come back 45 mins later for the latest updates on my canceled flight. When I came back to the gate, the ground team announced that we were going to be taken to Vienna by a plane provided by a partner company (Austrian) and transported to Graz by bus. This sounded more or less as a solution, but we were then asked to wait until 5pm to get on the plane. I wanted to re-book and to leave to Vienna earlier but found out that the company would only provide one bus at around 6pm and that theoretically I could fly to Vienna earlier and then wait to everyone else. So, I arrived in Graz at 10 pm instead of 1pm which caused a shift in all my plans for the day.

1309,T Girling,United Kingdom,2017-09-14,1,"✅ Verified Review   I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment.  I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldn’t the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt  I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled. I went to the reception desk and they had no explanation for the cancelled flight and I had been moved to LH918 flying to LHR.

1310,L Kline,Germany,2017-09-12,7,"✅ Verified Review  Flight from Seattle to Frankfurt, start afternoon in SEA, arrival early morning in FRA, so it was a night flight. Unfortunately, aircraft was a Boeing, thus seats much narrower than in an Airbus. Flight on time and very calm - usual, very good Lufthansa standard. However, cabin staff was not very attentive and sometimes even rude. Beverages were only rarely offered, collection of garbage even more rare. During the night, cabin staff went through the cabin with beverage trays, but did not look carefully if some passengers might be awake and wishing something to drink. About 2 hours before landing, I asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage, i.e. three empty cups. She said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products (which I know) and she had other guests to care for. She would be back later. I asked when as I was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing, and she said ""soon"". I did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept, just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast, whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. Had a flight with Air Canada from Frankfurt to Calgary three weeks earlier, and they offered beverages much more often, and they also collected garbage. It was my first time that I experienced rude Lufthansa cabin staff, but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during long-distance flights, and they also collect garbage more frequently. Breakfast: only savoury, omelette with roasted bacon and onions. I prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of German breakfast on a flight to Germany with a German airline: some bread, butter, jam, maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. I am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers' wishes, but a choice between a Northern American breakfast and a continental (German) breakfast would have been highly appreciated. Why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner (pasta or chicken)? I still recommend and choose LH for short-distance flights within Europe. First because of Lufthansa's safety standards, second because I can cope with some kind of thirst during short flights.

Victoria to Vancouver  20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada Jazz used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops; and Munich to Geneva by Air Dolomiti on Embraer E195. Vancouver to Munich on A330-300 aircraft. Air Dolomiti flights had comfortable seating, and featured a couple of different regional Italian wines on each flight. LH Premium Economy seating was 2-3-2 across (instead of 2-4-2 in economy), with an extra four inches of legroom (35-inch pitch). Extra legroom and footrest were welcome but seats were narrower than they ought to have been. Between the window-seat armrests and the fuselage was a 5-cm gap on each side of the plane, and all seats had tray tables in the armrests. The front row of Premium Economy also had IFE screens in the armrests – small screens half the size of those in the other rows. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 1½ hours before landing. The meals seemed to be  regular economy meals – chicken or pasta options for the main meal – except that in Premium Economy they were served on porcelain and serving size may have been slightly larger. IFE was good, although films and TV shows were classified in unexpected categories. Outbound connection from YYJ through YVR is always easy because domestic passengers can remain on the secure airside to international flights without a further security screening at YVR. Connection through MUC was better than a year ago because, although you have to go through passport control entering the Schengen area, no extra security screening was required there either. Likewise on the return trip, no further security screening was required through MUC leaving the Schengen area. When entering Canada at YVR you have to go through Canadian Border Services inspection and collect your baggage but even at that point, for passengers connecting to domestic flights, they provide a dedicated area for onward baggage transfer and a dedicated security checkpoint. Despite connection times of only 1 hour to 1½ hours at YVR and MUC, both my bags arrived with me at the destination. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes.

I phoned Lufthansa reservations and they told me that I was right and that I absolutely did not require a visa for a 1 hour transit and I should try to check in online instead, which I did sucessfully. However, the Swissport staff at the airport still refused to give me a boarding pass and allow me to board the flight. They claimed to have phoned German immigration in Algeria but refused to give the name of the person they had spoken to. Their refusal to check me in led me to miss my flight. They refused to provide anything in writing despite me asking several times. I wasted an enormous amount of time and money getting to Marrakech airport, paying for a hotel there, car rental and reserving accomodation in Istanbul. Lufthansa took my money and then refused to allow me to travel. It appears that buying a Lufthansa ticket is like a lottery ticket - maybe you will get to fly somewhere but maybe you will just be told ""no"" and then the ticket that you paid lots of money for becomes worthless.

1376,Immanuel Lanzaderas,Canada,2017-05-26,9,"✅ Verified Review   Budapest to Montreal via Munich. I was going to upgrade to Premium Economy, but reviews said it was pretty much the same seat and food as regular economy; so, I didn't. Online check-in was easy using the booking code, but there was no option to upgrade. To find that out, I had to go to a service counter in Munich. Flight out of Budapest was late, but staff were apologetic about it. Boarding process in Munich was a bit chaotic, since they did not inform passengers about the pre-boarding document check (which seems redundant, since they are not Customs, and we all already went through customs). Staff on the flight were friendly and attentive. They re-arranged seats for a couple with an infant, so that they could use the bassinet in the first row. The woman who gave up her seat got a voucher to use for duty free. These are really nice touches that show they see their passengers as real people with real needs. Alcohol selection was excellent: sparkling wine, wines, beers, liquors, and cognac for after the meal. The meal was fine. I liked the chicken, and the real cutlery. The entertainment system is worth choosing Lufthansa over other airlines that are offering less for within $200 of the the price. There were hundreds of movies to choose from - from many different cultures. The system was really responsive and quick.

1377,Ben Lolley,United Kingdom,2017-05-23,8,"✅ Verified Review   Washington to Birmingham via Frankfurt. This was my first experience with Lufthansa, products I experienced were Economy on the A319-100 and Premium Economy on A340-300. I opted to fly with LH as they offered both the best price for the overall trip and the most favourable times to work with my journey plans. I had initially planned to fly Economy for the entirety of the journey; however, the additional cost for a premium economy seat was so minor that it made sense to elect for the premium option. I made the booking using the LH website initially, which was fine, but then opted to manage my booking using the mobile app. The app I found to be very cumbersome and slow. It took some navigating to make simple amendments like seat choices or adding API/visa data.  I didn't have hold baggage for this journey so my exposure to ground staff was minimal. The first leg of my journey commenced at BHX. The check in process proceeded without issue; however there was a slight delay with boarding, and we departed 30 minutes late. This made me nervous given that I was meeting a connecting flight, however the cabin crew were friendly, informed us of progress and connection plans at all times. I was seated in 10A, and exit row seat with ample leg room. We were offered a basic snack (marble cake) and a juice/coffee. Service was expedient and pleasant; which is how I would describe all of the flight. After landing at FRA I proceeded to my next flight. Unlike many airlines there aren't many ground perks for flying PE with LH. no lounge access, no priority boarding. The enhanced comfort offered on board however is more than worth the cost. The PE seats on the A340 were akin to retro business class seats. Wide, with built in IFE and tray table, with a foot stand (I was in 10A again). I had an end of aisle seat which meant I was not reclined in to. The catering option offered with PE is the same as economy, served on China and with metal cutlery and a glass. It doesn't sound much but it in fact makes the experience considerably more pleasant. We were allowed use of the business class lavatories which was nice given the economy toilets were a good 15 rows back. The cabin crew overall were friendly and helpful. They seemed cheerful and willing to do as much as they could to enhance your experience. For the flight back I elected to pay to use the IAD Lufthansa BC Lounge. It cost a mere $35 and was worth every penny... however, it lacked some of the comfort and grandure usually associated with lounges. As an economy passenger I wasn't particularly fussed but If I was a BC passenger paying a flexi fare (i.e. a lot of money) I'd have found the lounge to be understaffed, A little untidy, and lacking in food options. The return legs were almost identical to the outbound; same aircraft, same seats, same comfort, friendly crew. The food on this occasion was served in tins, but this can be overlooked. Again the crew offered use of the business class lavatories which I appreciated. Overall my first experiences with Lufthansa were good.

Both outbound legs were uneventful despite an hour delay leaving FRA, arriving 20 minutes behind schedule into PEK. Found the Boeing 747-800 series a tad cramped for such a large aircraft.

1396,H Richards,United Kingdom,2017-04-15,3,"✅ Verified Review   I recently flew from Manchester to Atlanta via Frankfurt and back with Lufthansa. I was travelling as part of a group and so decided to book a seat to be close to friends. I was surprised that on a flight that cost nearly £1000, I would have to pay to choose my seat but I decided it would be worth paying £20 each way per person for myself and a companion to ensure that we sat together (£80 in total). The first issue I had was that the seats we were given on the flight from Frankfurt to Atlanta and the return leg were not the ones I had booked. We ended up on the very rear row of seats but we were at least sat together. On both flights (10 hours) we were served vegetarian food because apparently Lufthansa only offer chicken to those toward the front of those the plane. To make matters worse, I was later offered a hot dog for lunch, because they had run out of pizza. The hot dog was still completely frozen. I didn't make a fuss, I thought that I would get a refund for the seats and that would be the end of it. The flight itself was comfortable and smooth so I wasn't too unhappy until I spoke with Lufthansa customer services. They told me that the seat booking fee is non refundable and that booking a seat only entitles you to that ""type of seat"" and does not mean you will be sat in the seat that you chose when you made the reservation. So ultimately I have paid for a seat that I didn't get, I had the same type of seat as everyone in economy and yet they refuse to give me the £80 back.

1399,B Stauffer,South Africa,2017-04-09,9,"✅ Verified Review   Flew Geneva to Johannesburg via Frankfurt. The Premium Economy on Lufthansa's B747-800 is strangely squeezed between a mini Economy cabin in the front and the main Economy cabin in the back. There are no separating walls or curtains, which kinds of defeats the ""premium"" feeling (therefore, the 2 dedicated toilets are used by everybody). The seating configuration is 2-4-2 (vs Economy 3-4-3). The seats are wide and recline well, but the foot rest is not well thought out for people over 180cm. The food is basically the same as economy, with an extra dish and served on real china and glasses (but Lufthansa's food offering is good in all classes anyway). Would I book it? Only if the price difference is minimal at booking.

1424,W Watson,United States,2017-02-16,7,"✅ Verified Review  I took Lufthansa flight LH457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt as the first leg of a trip to Warsaw. For this flight, Lufthansa uses the standard A380. I sat in seat 11D (middle row) in the upper deck. The first thing you feel in boarding this aircraft is that Lufthansa is efficient, courteous and professional. The cabin is clean if not a bit bland, but overall has a comfortable feel to it. The configuration is a 2-2-2, so the middle row is the best bet, as each seat is an aisle. The seats are comfortable and are lay-flat. My only issue is that the controls for the seat are touch and therefore, if you are resting your arm on the armrest, you seat tends to ""readjust"" itself if you brush against the controls. In the lay flat position, the seats are typical of most airlines as they are not exceedly wide, like Singapore Airlines, and narrow for the footwell. One issue is that your feet land on a ledge on the bulkhead which has only a small divider between your feet and your neighbors. Often during the flight, I was awoken as my seatmate changed position and her feet brushed mine. A minor inconvenience, but for some may be too creepy. The service on the flight was very good, if not at the personal level of some of the Asian competitors. The food was decent, but not exceptional and misses the touches of other airlines like ANA, Singapore or even Austrian. The in-flight entertainment is very good. The TV screens are large, clear and easy to see both in the dark and with the cabin lights on. The screen is operated by touch or a remote. You have a massive amount of choices and they seem to have many of the latest movies. Overall, the flight does what it is advertised to do. It gets you there safely, comfortably and in timely manner.

1425,W Watson,United States,2017-02-15,6,"✅ Verified Review   Inter-Europe Business Class is always a disappointment and Lufthansa's A319 is no exception. This flight was LH1348 between Frankfurt and Warsaw and although it is a relatively short flight, it is always connected with a long-haul to Frankfurt, so after 10 hours of flight-time, being crammed into coach seats is never welcome.

1429,T Eldem,Canada,2017-02-11,3,"✅ Verified Review   Munich to Montreal. I checked in online and had no luggage so bypassed the counter all together. At the gate, I discovered that they gave the same boarding pass, with my name, to my colleague. This was most unusual considering at check in they would have had to match my colleagues boarding pass to the name on his passport. Consequently my colleague had to return to the service desk to sort out the mix-up. Boarding was smooth and o board the aircraft appeared well kept. Following take off we were offered drinks and then lunch. I was seated in the second row of a very lightly loaded business class. When I told the FA what I wanted for lunch she apologetically said that they had run out of that choice. The meal I settled for was well presented but lacked taste. The dessert was dry and inedible. Wine selection was okay but I would have liked more choice. The seat was reasonably comfortable and allowed me to have two hours of decent sleep. IFE was mediocre with a sparse selection of new releases. The FA serving my side of the aircraft was friendly and courteous. Flight left slightly late but arrived on schedule. This was my second flight in Lufthansa's business class in less than a month and I am starting to think they are cutting corners.

1435,M Kronz,Germany,2017-01-24,7,"✅ Verified Review   We flew Lufthansa business class from Barcelona to Munich on January 15, 2017. Apart from some minor ""beauty defects"", none of which turned out to be Lufthansa ´s fault, the flight was uneventful and quite pleasant. We spent some time at the ""Sala Pau Casalls"" business lounge which is a total let-down (see my separate review). Boarding was unpleasant because the announcements were totally incomprehensible and the Airport Operator AENA seems to be finnicky about hand baggage sizes. They refused to let me take my trolley bag onboard because, despite the fact that it has the required dimensions, it expands when it is fully packed. They didn´t mind about that at MUC but they do at BCN. My bag was checked in and arrived on the same flight as myself in MUC, so no major disaster, but you have to be aware of the situation. The business class experience on this flight was pretty much the same as on the inbound MUC-BCN flight - friendly and attentive staff, good food and drinks, good legroom etc, but our A321 was older than the A320 on the inbound flight and had a sort of fixed tray table spanning the free middle seat which is unnecessary and uncomfortable. There is no inflight entertainment except via the downloadable LH app, which some people will object to, but I don´t.

1436,M Kronz,Germany,2017-01-24,7,"✅ Verified Review   We flew Lufthansa Business Class from Munich to Barcelona on January 8, 2017. Our flight was supposed to leave from Munich's new Terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the Star Alliance Schengen Business Lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Munich right now is going through a phase of Siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didn´t make it to the airport on time"". Funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. During that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside Terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. Boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasn´t forthcoming. Boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off Terminal 1 which LH doesn´t even use. Our A320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. In fact we didn´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. Obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. The flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in Barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. The Lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on European flights is worth the money in my opinion even if LH European business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. But the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean.

1447,P Petrov,Bulgaria,2017-01-10,2,"✅ Verified Review   Munich to Sofia. The Lufthansa return flight ruined an otherwise perfect holiday. Flights were late on both legs of the journey. On the outgoing flight the explanation given was that the crew had arrived late the previous night and had to use up their 12 hour day rest, so the next day flight was delayed. Our return flight was cancelled 40 minutes before scheduled takeoff. Of course no explanations given, but considering that most other flights were departing on schedule it must not have been the weather. We were quickly rebooked to another flight 4 hours later. 30 min before takeoff that flight was delayed by 1.40 hours, so by the time we boarded we had almost 6 hours of delay. The flight did not depart at the newly announced time either, since doors closed more than 40 minutes later and by the time we were airborne it was another hour late. The flight itself was ok and apparently we made up for some of the delay. Little did we know that after landing we would have another hour of delay, this time waiting for our luggage. The crew's bags were delivered earlier but the passengers had to wait until 1.20 am to get their bags, with noone from Lufthansa or the ground handling operator to explain what was going on. So instead of getting home at 6 something p.m. the previous day we got home at almost 2 am on a Monday - not ideal if you have to go to work at 8.00 am (wish I had the ability to delay my start of work for the 12 hours rest, like the Lufthansa crew).",,Couple Leisure,Business Class,MUC to SOF,January 2017,3.0,5.0,3.0,,1.0,,1,no,False,MUC,SOF,,Neutral,0.2263,  verify review munich sofia return ruin otherwise perfect holiday flight late leg journey outgo explanation give crew arrive late previous night use 12 hour day rest next day delay return cancel 40 minute schedule takeoff course explanation give consider flight depart schedule must weather quickly rebooked another 4 hour later 30 min takeoff delay hour time board almost 6 hour delay depart newly announce time either since door close 40 minute later time airborne another hour late ok apparently make delay little know land another hour delay time wait luggage crew bag deliver early passenger wait get bags noone ground handle operator explain go instead get home 6 something previous day get home almost 2 monday ideal go work wish ability delay start work 12 hour rest like crew
1448,T Eldem,Canada,2017-01-10,1,"✅ Verified Review   Ankara to Munich on Lufthansa. I have been a fan of Lufthansa for many years but this flight rocked my confidence in them. Following a smooth check-in we proceeded to the lounge which was sweltering hot and had a very poor selection of food and no cold drinks. The departure was delayed due to late arrival of inbound aircraft and further delayed due to late boarding. However, there was no explanation for the reasons of delay or an apology from the cockpit. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept. It was the European business class configuration with the middle seat of economy style seating left vacant. The FA's were friendly and efficient which was the only redeeming feature of this journey. The food was below acceptable for Business Class and a huge letdown for LH. As expected we were late arriving in Munich and it took over 1 hour from the time we reached our gate for the bags to be delivered.

1450,Z Navrenko,Russian Federation,2017-01-07,1,"✅ Verified Review   Chicago to Moscow via Frankfurt. Extremely miserable experience from business class travel.  Our flight from Chicago was delayed due to some technical problem with the aircraft. Ok, I get it, troubles happen. We had to wait 2 extra hours in a rather miserable United lounge in Chicago. On the aircraft in 2 toilets out of 3 in business, the toilet seat was not holding itself while opened - meaning you have to hold it. When the aircraft was landing some of the next flights were announced to be rebooked, but neither my flight, nor my husband was. Even though there were some flights departing after our flights, we were not announced to be rebooked. When we came out of the plane, there was a service person from Lufthansa answering questions. My husband was guided to the service desk and to me the men standing there said: ""if you run you can catch your flight"". It was 9:30 am and my initial flight LH1444 was boarding at 9:15 in a different zone (we landed to Z zone in FRA airport and my boarding was at B gate). Knowing that FRA is one of the biggest airports in the world I though it may be reasonable to go to the service desk with my husband and ask for a change of the ticket as ""running"" through the airport was not an exactly appealing option for a person with a knee injury. However, when we came to the service desk, there was a man guiding the queue to service desk windows and he also told me that I should run to catch my flight. It was 9:35 AM (as mentioned before, my boarding started at 9:15 AM). So if two people told me I should run I decided to leave my husband who was traveling to Prague and try to catch my flight. The trouble was that few steps later there was a different zone of the airport, then I had to go through train and security check, being out of breath when I finally came to the gate it was 9:50 AM and my flight had already left. The lady at the desk said that she is not willing to help me and I should go back to the service desk and change my ticket. In the lounge, they changed my ticket to 12:40 pm. Same time was the flight time for my husband, but as he was flying to Prague, and me to Moscow, we had to stay in different airport zones and were not able to come to each other. When I was boarding the plane, there was no walkway, but a bus, and they were saying that business goes after families with children to the bus. And the employee on the desk was extremely rude, screaming at business passengers they should wait till all children go the bus first. On the plane, the seats were not even with adjustable head. We had to wait for 45 minutes (plus to 4h flight) for some luggage to be loaded-unloaded and for some passenger to come to the plane. During this extra time of waiting in the aircraft there were no drinks offered.

1451,Charles Walsh,Canada,2017-01-05,10,"✅ Verified Review   Newark to Dusseldorf. Only through the grace of about a billion points was I able to snag a Newark to Dusseldorf reward flight to experience Lufthansa’s renowned First Class on my way to a final destination of Lisbon. I felt somewhat unworthy as I settled myself into my 2A open suite, however, I worked hard to maintain the requisite “I belong here” demeanor, unlike the fellow in front of me who danced in the aisle, champagne flute in hand, celebrating after his boss switched seats with him (boss relocating to Business). The A340-600 First Class cabin was full. I spent the first fifteen minutes sipping champagne, enjoying macadamia nuts, and playing with what seemed like several hundred seating variations from which to choose. Service, food and beverage was for the most part stellar although once it was ‘lights out’, our two attendants did somewhat of a disappearing act, although I’m sure they would have been prompt if I had rang for service. The dinner service was outstanding, caviar first course, followed by a trio of appetizers, lobster main, chocolate dessert, complimented with some excellent tasting wines, and all served course by course on a well-sized and nicely laid out dining table. An after-dinner aperitif coupled with a cappuccino (and a few more sweets thrown in for good measure) concluded a wonderful dining experience. Seats were promptly converted into comfortable looking beds with myself as the only hold-out. With privacy dividers raised, the group settled into a state of individual slumber. I chose to catch up on a few recent-run films through the night. A perfect photo-op of a sunrise appeared much too early, as did the perfectly prepared breakfast offering of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  Finishing my breakfast, I changed back into my streets in the very spacious and clean washroom. There was a noticeable lack of interaction with the flight crew. Except for the obligatory “Willkommen to, Danke für” announcements from the flight deck, nothing else was offered. Perhaps the pilots were feeling miffed with their airline, and working to rule, choosing not to associate with even the first class passengers as has apparently happened in the past. The Lufthansa First Class experience is truly special, and not only the in-flight portion, but the other touches such as personal escort from check-in, past security, and into the lounge, as well as the lounges themselves, the service and amenities offered on either continent. As I left the sanctity of the First Class section, a sense of claustrophobia overwhelmed me and I realized I was turning my nose up at Lufthansa Business Class! And, as I sat in TAP Business on my flight segment to Lisbon, with my all-on-one lunch tray crowding my thirty four inches of pitch, I reflected on how fortunate I was to have experienced the Lufthansa First Class product.

1453,K Teaken,Canada,2017-01-04,4,"✅ Verified Review   Toronto to Pune via Frankfurt. We arrived late on the Air Canada flight from YYZ to FRA and missed our connecting Lufthansa flight to PNQ. There was no special arrangement to hurry the transit passengers to their flight. We had to wait for 3 busses to be filled as we were parked on the tarmac, prior to moving to the gate. Upon reaching the gate, we checked with the ground staff available and they told us to rush to the specified gate for our flight. We had to walk there, which we did, along with other passengers. By the time we reached the gate after going through Security, it was 5 minutes to the departure time - we were told that the flight had departed and we had to walk back to the customer service counter from where we had come for additional assistance. They advised us that they had not been intimated that we were on our way to catch the flight (along with 2 other passengers), even though we had our boarding cards. The Lufthansa ground staff insisted that it was the fault of Air Canada as the flight was operated by them.  They said the earliest connecting flight was at 7:00 am the next morning via Delhi. I had to remind them that there was an earlier one LH0760, which they agreed to put us on. They got us the tickets and told us to rush to the terminal to catch the flight before it left. We asked for a cart and were told none was available (we happened to get on the cart which the other 2 passengers who had also missed the flight were given by another ground staff). We had to go through Security again and had issues with the alcohol we had purchased in Toronto.  We requested an upgrade due to our exhaustion and inconvenience, which was refused.

1454,M Norton,Canada,2017-01-03,10,"✅ Verified Review   New York to Milan via Frankfurt. Seat 1A in First class. This was a special trip to Northern Italy for Christmas with my extended family and an Aeroplan reward ticket. We left pretty close to on time and they made up time on the way over. As soon as we boarded, I changed into the pyjamas and settled in for the overnight flight. Champagne and macadamias arrived quickly and on the seat was the Rimowa amenity kit. Meal service was delicious from the amuse bouche, caviar, black pepper pasta and I think it was chocolate bread pudding, though I was so full I couldn't. The wonderful champagne, I had the old world red and a lovely port. The crew on board couldn't do enough for us yet it still felt really private with a full cabin. After dinner, they made up the bed with a comfy top and bottom duvet and I got almost 5 hours of sleep. Breakfast was fresh and wonderful, I ate light as I had a 6 hour connection in Frankfurt before flying to Milan. My favourite part of flying first on Lufthansa is the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. This is a separate building with no gates attached. You walk out the main terminal doors and turn left and it's a five minute walk. Take the elevator up and they personally take care of you from then on. You can do this not only as a departing but as an arriving first class passenger too. The whole place is bar, they have a smoking room with, and I don't smoke them but my friends would love the cigars. Shower/bathrooms, private snooze rooms and comfy wing chairs and ottomans to sit and read a book. One of the three bathrooms has not only a shower but a full on soaker tub too. I booked it and read my book until my time came. Lufthansa understands that some of us still love to fly and it's about the experience and the swag. Sitting on the bath tub was another collectible Lufthansa First Class Terminal rubber ducky to add the collection. I had a delicious breakfast in the a la carte restaurant, the mimosas and long espressos were great too. It was Christmas after all and vacation. When time came to board they escorted me downstairs to a waiting limo (they have a fleet of Mercedes, Audi, BMW and Porsche vehicles from sedans to SUV's). They drive you across the tarmac to your next flight. I find it hard to fault Lufthansa these days, I like the whole experience in the air and on the ground. There are rumours that LH will discontinue first from North America, I hope not. I could get where I'm going in a shorter route but I consistently fly the long way round to Europe to experience this kind of service.

1465,S Rasmussen,Lithuania,2016-11-30,7,"✅ Verified Review   Going out to Funchal was a memorable experience due to service minded staff and really good food. Going back was somewhat different, as staff seemed tired, and the fact that Economy class stewards were in charge of Business class when the business class FA were having a break. Pushing the Cabin Attendant button did not make anyone come. Two very different experiences. No IFE was provided on the four hour flights between Funchal and Frankfurt, which is not good enough. However, there was an entertainment App available, but you need to download it before taking off. It's not available for Windows Phone, and when you get informed about the App, it's too late to install it, as flight mode is required, which to me makes no sense.

1467,M Vihama,United States,2016-11-28,1,"✅ Verified Review   I was supposed to fly out of New Delhi to Boston via Frankfurt on 26th November when the pilot strike was extended and I became its latest victim. My flight to Frankfurt was just a few hours away when I got a text that the other leg of my journey from Frankfurt to Boston had been cancelled. I could not afford to be stranded in Frankfurt and nearing panic and desperate, I managed to book another flight through British Airways which would land me in Boston just a few hours later than the cancelled Lufthansa flight. So seventeen hundred dollars and a lot of heartache later, I finally landed in Boston. The following day, I decided to reach out to Lufthansa customer service to inquire about my refund for my cancelled flight. A curt lady told me that the refund was in process and would take anywhere from a couple of days to a week to go through, but she would not divulge the amount to me. I went ahead and told her that I had spent $1700 to rebook my flight just so I could be back in time for my wife's surgery at which point I was told, and I quote - ""that was your decision and your problem. We are not liable for it"". So, was it my fault that Lufthansa decided to cancel my flight because of the pilot strike which is their own internal problem? And they have had this issue for years; their cabin crew and pilots have gone on impromptu strikes for the past couple of years now and the ones to suffer are the gullible passengers. Lufthansa reported recorded profits this year and it is not hard to imagine where most of that money came from: their gullible customers who they so merrily swindle at every opportunity. The only reason that I have posted this review is that I do not want another person to go through what me (and probably thousands of others) have suffered at the hands of this inconsiderate and greedy airline. I would dearly suggest to you that if you are booking your flight at least a month in advance, you are better off going with a more stable airline, as Lufthansa is very unpredictable and can cancel flights and leave passengers stranded with no recourse whatsoever.

I booked Premium Economy as I usually do on other airlines where available. Overall, I thought that whilst the flight was comfortable and reasonable value, the Lufthansa Premium Economy was not as good as other airlines that I have used. There was just a few rows within the Economy class and the only thing to differentiate Premium Economy from Economy was the seats and legroom (which were fine I might add). The food was the same as Economy (very average both ways even by Economy standards although printed on a different Premium Economy menu), shared the same stewards on board and at check-in and boarding there was no separate boarding queue for Premium Economy. Whilst these are not big issues at all I do feel that for paying twice the airfare they might have offered slightly more to differentiate it from Economy.

In the end we left 1 hour after schedule. The LH app never reported any delay at all. This scenario I have experienced about 3 times in the last 4 months. I have been flying LH regularly for 2.5 years (I don't have much choice unfortunately) and I don't remember the last time that the plane left on schedule. LH is really bad in timeliness.

1488,Dionysis Kefallinos,Germany,2016-10-02,4,"✅ Verified Review   I got a ticket from Strasbourg to Athens via Frankfurt return. This includes a Lufthansa Express bus on the SXB-FRA-SXB segments. I missed the SXB-FRA segment, and got to FRA (200 Km) with my car, 2 hours before the flight and with a valid boarding pass. However, while trying to board the plane, I was denied entry and I was informed that all the rest of my segments were canceled, including return from ATH. They argued that I missed the 1st segment (the bus) and when I complained that this is only a bus, they said that they treat the bus the same as the plane (keep this in mind).  They wanted me to buy a new ticket, because my ticket was not rebookable and then see when I would fly! After much grief, they allowed to board; fortunately there was 1 seat, but warned me to call LH as soon as I got to ATH. So I did and asking them to show me where are these terms stated (that is, if I miss the 1st segment and in particular the bus, all are canceled), they couldn't. After much debate, they  issued a new ticket for me for the return, for small admin fee.

1489,Michel Perrin,Brazil,2016-09-30,8,"I arrived 3 hours before departure of my flight from Paris CDG - Frankfurt - LH1047. My connection time in FRA was tight (75 min, T.A to T.C, with immigration + security). However one flight (90 minutes before, LH1041) had available seats. Suddenly CDG T1 went on red alert due to 2 suspect abandoned luggages and circulation was limited. I asked to take the previous flight to FRA remaining unchanged my FRA-GIG intercontinental flight. I was directed to ticket counter where there was no LH employee. A call centre was called, and they requested payment of Euros 1050,00 for this 90 minutes anticipation on the first leg of my business class trip, despite terrorist alert. I refused. There are situation when common sense and passengers security must prevail over airline revenue on fines.

1490,Eelco van den Heuvel,Netherlands,2016-09-30,9,"✅ Verified Review  It's a pity Lufthansa handed over almost all European routes to Eurowings (except for those out of Frankfurt and Munich), because it's a great airline also on short domestic hops. Good legroom in the very quiet A320neo. Efficient service since you get handed over a chocolate bar at the entrance, so the crew only has to serve drinks.

Short business trip to Mexico, I decided to use Premium Economy and was satisfied with this product. The comfort during such a long flight was improved with a much wider and softer seat with very good legroom. As usual with LH, staff was courteous and professional, not over friendly but surely polite. I have to mention the weird announcements in Spanish back from Mexico City as they were super bad and I believe they should hire some native speaking crew member becuase the whole plane was laughing at the very weird accent. Food was good on the outbound flight but mediocre on the way back. A few more complaints - boarding in FRA was pretty disorganized and slow becuase the automatic machines were out of order and no priority was given to PE passengers. On the final leg from MUC to Milan, they displayed 1h delay on the screens so I went for breakfast: when I was done I realized that they had moved it back to its original schedule so I rushed to the gate to find out they had just started to board.

The most important thing was that all flights were on time and uneventful. The planes were clean and seemed to be in good technical situation. Enough legroom for a medium tall (1.75 m) passenger as I am. Cabin crew and ground staff were polite and efficient. The food was quite poor (better on FRA-MAD leg), sandwiches just edible. Fortunately they kept Warsteiner in their offer. No inflight entertainment and the announcements from cockpit difficult to understand.

Both legs of the journey had short change over times and both times the flight was delayed, meaning a stressful sprint across one side of the terminal to another. Onboard, there were plenty of drinks being offered and the cabin crew were friendly and approachable. Only downsides were the hard, flat seats and the boring entertainment options (only 3 Korean movies were offered even though 95% of the passengers were Korean. I noticed others were bored too).

1496,Max Blanck,Italy,2016-09-10,8,"✅ Verified Review   The flight from Frankfurt to Rome FCO was an all-round solid experience. We flew aboard a very new (2015) A320-200 with sharklets. Unfortunately the weather was not that great so we experienced some turbulence. LH European business class seats are the same as those in economy but with a free middle seat. I am not too tall so I don't mind them, as they are quite comfortable and have a very supporting firm backrest. I always try to sit in the first row so legroom was no problem. The foldout table mounted to the bulkhead is a nice touch and very spacious. The food was good (a salade nicoise and a dessert), adequate for the time of the day (5pm) but a little more could be expected, as everything looks a little bland. The purser, however, was very attentive and friendly. I really like the Lufthansa  colour scheme as it gives the whole plane a classy look. The complete lack of IFE puzzles me however and I really miss the air show that allows me to follow the route. All in all a solid product and good value for money if you also factor in the possibility to access the FRA business class lounge.",A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,FRA to FCO,September 2016,4.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,,4,yes,False,FRA,FCO,,Positive,0.9829,  verify review frankfurt rome fco solid experience fly aboard new 2015 sharklets unfortunately weather great experienced turbulence lh european business class seat economy free middle seat tall mind quite comfortable support firm backrest always try sit first row legroom problem foldout table mount bulkhead nice touch spacious food good salade nicoise dessert adequate time day 5pm little expect everything look little bland purser however attentive friendly really like colour scheme give whole classy look complete lack ife puzzle however really miss air show allow follow route solid product good value money factor possibility access fra business class lounge

Fridge not working so no cold drinks. Food was very light so saved myself for the flight, bad mistake. They have a press button survey machine at the entrance to the lounge - they know it's bad. Hit the unhappy face. The flight food was delivered before any drinks. Had to wait 10 minutes for the non dedicated business class staff (they did economy class as well) to get around to serving me a glass of water, so I could eat the lousy prawn and inedidable chunk of tuna. Second glass if wine? No, serving economy class passengers. Luckily the flight was just under 2 hours. I'm now in the business class lounge at Frankfurt, Z concourse. No staff to serve a drink, but two staff sitting behind a desk doing nothing? The Virgin lounge at Perth airport, in Australia, is much better.
