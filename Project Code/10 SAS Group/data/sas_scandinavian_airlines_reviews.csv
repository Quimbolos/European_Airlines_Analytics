0,Marc Schmidt,United States,2023-11-13,1,"SAS is by far the most hideous, cynical and humiliating airline out there.  It summarizes the idea of making the economy experience as miserable as possible, so next time you're willing to pay all kinds of upgrades. A humiliating concept with the goal to squeeze as much money as possible out of every flight to shovel a few more pennies to their shareholders. . Legroom is non existent. On an 11 hours transatlantic flight your knees are jammed between your's and the front seat. Except one tiny free drink with what they call meal (of course only non-alcoholic), they hold a credit-card terminal under your nose, even for a miniature-can of coke. Attached photo of the atrocity called ""dinner"" condenses their cynicism in a says-it-all image. Of course the luggage got lost and exactly no-one at SAS felt compelled to help relocating it. ""Not our problem."" It was delivered 4 days after our arrival. It comes with no surprise that up to now it is impossible to reach anyone for the modest compensation of $150 to bridge those 4 messed up vacation days with fresh underwear and a few care products for 2 people. This airline is an absolute disgrace. Avoid them like the plague.",,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Hamburg via Copenhagen,October 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,1,no,True,Washington,Hamburg,Copenhagen
1,D Garsen,United Kingdom,2023-11-12,2,Where to start Check in was good There is no use of a lounge in Manchester Flight was 2.50 late Everyone's Luggage was off loaded at Manchester due to a fault in the hold. Customer services in Stockholm just handed us a card to do the delayed luggage ourselves  No ownership  The only person who showed any concern was baggage manager. I emailed Customer services who just gave a standard answer and CEO who has not replied. The Customer services director who I spoke to by tel was utterly disinterested I did get my bag 24 hours later SAS have not even had the courtesy of replying to me. On a positive the crew were friendly and efficient This is simply the worst customer service I have ever received from an airline I guess they will read this and shrug their shoulders I will be astonished if they reach out but I live in hope.

2,Kathleen Paolini-Kennington,United States,2023-10-23,1,"Never check a bag onto a SAS flight, unless you have the means to replace all of it. I flew SAS from Rome to London. I landed in Heathrow with the clothes on my back, after they left my baggage behind at the layover city, and I had another 7 weeks of travel ahead of me. Everything I had in that bag was basically new, some still with tags. Even the suitcase was new. They literally gaslight you, having you fill out spreadsheets, down to the color, brand, cost, place of purchase of socks. They said they need that in order to ""identify"" my luggage. Then, they have you do it again for the claim. Then, 3 months later, they gave me 400, which basically covered the suitcase. They never even refunded the baggage fee. You may as well pick up a second job to make up for the lost money, after you were forced to spend your holiday at shopping at the mall, on top of the hours spend filling out forms and uploading receipts, only to be insulted in the end.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to London via Copenhagen,July 2023,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Rome,London,Copenhagen
3,Kirstie Burndred,United Kingdom,2023-10-06,1,I recently booked flights with SAS and received an email to say my flight had changed. When on the ‘my booking’ section there were no suitable options so I was left with no other choice but to cancel my flight. I was then only refunded 10% of the flight as after cancelling only at this point was I advised that the flight was only moved by 5 minutes but I was advised that the flight had moved by a day. I then asked for the flight to be uncanceled and I was advised ‘it’s your fault your problem you must pay’.

4,F Bauer,Germany,2023-10-04,1,"I took a flight from Paris to Larnaca via Oslo. As I arrived in Cyprus my suitcase did not. After waiting for the woman for one hour who was responsible for this flight company SAS, I got a phone number of the person who is in charge for giving an update for lost items (during all this time we had a car booked from car sharing - so we needed to spend money during this time). At no time of a day somebody was answering the phone. A week later I needed to take a car from the car sharing to go to the airport to finally receive some information but they had still no idea. For 13 days there were no news, no location of the suitcase, no hint that it is not stolen. A hell for me because there were things inside with high value for me. The first time I knew that it is still existing was because of a personal call from Oslo that they will send my suitcase to Cyprus. This call just happened because my number was on a sign on the suitcase. In general, I had to wait 15 days until my suitcase was arriving. In the end SAS takes no costs at all. Neither they care about the extra stuff I needed to buy (cosmetics, bikini) nor the uncomfortable feeling I had nor they pay the extra costs I had because of the car sharing to fight for information they owed me. All that because I paid for a flight with a good service. Is it not a little bit ironic? The service is for a flight company which is defining itself not to be part of a cheap one, is really bad. I gave money to SAS for not doing their job correctly, losing my suitcase and not being a help at all. They do not even try to be sorry. Whenever it is possible, it is better to avoid SAS! They do not care about their customers, the trouble they cause or the mistakes they are doing.

Immediately we went to the counter and our luggage as missing. Expected it to arrive the following day. Five weeks on, numerous phone calls and a few emails, still no luggage. The numbers listed on their website either don’t answer or you are told that is another department. New number, same result. We have given a description of the contents but since then, not even a polite update. We did not start a claim within 21 days, foolishly believing it would still turn up.

Crew was very friendly - food was super and the business class seat is very good with space and privacy. The blanket is one of the best I ever had.

8,Edris Salih,Canada,2023-09-02,2,"SAS airline has the worst customer service. I did travel on the middle of May of this year. Few very bad things happened with me and I explained this in my case which I attached in a file and I sent to SAS. Here I am just mention about my luggage is delayed for one day and since that day I was contacting them until I got back to Canada. I did register with their customer service that my luggage is delayed and they record everything and they gave me the paper to prove that and I sent this paper to SAS. I asked the customer service to deliver my luggage to the address that I have, she told me call this number and when your luggage is arrived this evening will let you know. However, I could not stay in airport and I went to my visits place without my luggage. All afternoon and night of that day I tried hundred time to contact them but no one was answered me. Therefore, I came back to Schiphol airport for tomorrow to getting back my luggage. After two hours of investigation I could get my luggage is back and again they gave a paper of that delay and I sent this paper to SAS too. When I got back to Canada, end of May, I sent email to them with all my documents and I explained in detail what happened to me. After one month a person from customer service answered me. He asked me to send them something called (PIR) number and also my bank info to send me back what I spent because of this issue. I told them these are all paper that I have from my travel. After several weeks they sent me another email and they told me this is your clime number. There was no update and I sent another email and again they asked me about PIR number. I told them I do not know what is this but you have all my information and the specific papers of delaying is luggage. However, we exchanged around 12 emails and I have all of them. Last month I sent back another email about is there any new update. Few days ago they sent me an email and told me that your file will be closed because I had to claimed my luggage during 21 days.

9,Raynold Aquino,Canada,2023-08-27,3,"On 18 July we received an email notification about Delay Information as follows: “Flight SK0944 Chicago ORD - Copenhagen CPH 19 Jul, with scheduled time of departure 22:00 is delayed to 11:15, 20 Jul”. No reasons/explanations were provided for the cause of delay. Airline carriers must first inform passengers of the reason in plain language, regardless of whether the situation is in their control or not. The new departure date on July 20 scheduled at 11:15 was further delayed to 12:54 PM CET, arriving 03:31AM CEST, (+1). This causes delayed arrival on final flight destination of more than 14 Hours from the original ticket (contract of carriage) thereby eligible for delayed flight compensation of CAD$1,000 per person x 2. (Per SAS tariffs Rules 85, Schedules D (O) and EU Reg. No 261/2004 Art. 6 (1)(a)(i)(ii)(iii). 2. On 19 July around 7:30PM, at the check-in counter at SAS in Chicago ORD, front desk’s staff confirmed the flight delays but declined to provide specific details/reasons when asked multiple times. Also, no alternative options were offered for another similar flight to reach final destination. However, the front desk’s staff were very patient and helpful in finding us hotel accommodation (to stay for the night 19 July) including meals and transportation to and from the airport per SAS tariff No. 376 (O) Rule 85 Schedule D page 86 & EU Reg 261 Article 9 (1)(a)(b)(c). On 15 August, we filed a request for delayed flight compensation on SAS online form. It was denied the next day 16 August thru email emphasizing that allegedly “BIRDSTRIKE” was the caused of delays which was not mentioned on SAS 18 July delay information email. The airline has to prove this by providing extracts from logbook or incident reports. The air carrier (SAS) should give this evidence to the relevant national enforcement body as well as to the PASSENGERS concerned in line with the national provisions on access to documents. Per phone conversation with SAS customer representative, she verified the cause on record as “BIRDSTRIKE” according to SAS database. She decline to provide further details and flatly turn down request for documents for the alleged incident. Flight Delay Certificate confirmed the flight irregularity but didn’t specify the alleged occurrence of BIRDSTRIKE incident. 3. In contrast to what the front desk staff said when asked about the cause of scheduled flight delays: “It was not delayed. It got cancelled. It has to be called delay only because there’s 2 flights today that have the same flight”.(Conversation audio recorded, 20 July) (FlightAware) 4. Indeed there’s 2 flights scheduled to depart ORD on 20 July (Doc. 4). Called SAS customer service on 17 August (Conversation was audio recorded) to verify the flight information based on our Booking Reference Number. She stressed out that per SAS database, our scheduled flight departed on 19 July Chicago ORD 22:00PM and arrived Copenhagen CPH on 20 July 13:20PM. 5.

We had arranged for transport to the airport at that time but at short notice could not find anyone else to take us to the airport for the later flight we were booked onto. We therefore had to get a taxi to the airport to arrive in time. In Sweden we had pre-booked coach tickets with Flixbus which we then had to change for a coach to coincide with the later flight which incurred another cost. We were invited by SAS to input a claim which we did immediately. They have however have decided that neither of these expenses are genuine and will not re-imbuse the expenses. They have closed the claim and will not now answer out emails and when I spoke to them on the phone they confirmed there was no way for me to escalate this claim.

17,N Stainer,Canada,2023-07-26,1,"This is the first time I'm travelling since Covid, going to my home country to visit family & friends, only the second time in 13 years I'm making this trip. What a horrible experience! Starting in Ottawa. Not fun at all going through the US customs control where I was treated like I was a criminal, just because their system didn't take my fingerprints. The leg from Ottawa to Newark was fairly ok, however, the leg from Newark to Copenhagen was horrible, even though I spent a lot of money in an online auction to upgrade my seat to premium. As a vegetarian, I pre-ordered with both my agent and the airline vegetarian food long before my trip started. I didn't get any food at all and had to sit and smell horrible meals for hours. I received nothing during all those hours on the plane, in my premium seat. I thought I was treating myself to something nice, but it was a waste of money instead. The inflight crew was also quite bad. Not once did they come over to ask if I wanted or needed anything, although I was in the premium section. One of them was chatting away with the person in front of me, not at all paying attention to the other travellers in the cabin. It was annoying. Then, during my first week in Norway, the airline cancelled my return ticket, without any chance to get me another return. After hours spent on the phone (my phone bill was $50 more expensive than normal) and chatting with various agents, who of course could not help me, I was supposed to get refunded for the cancelled return - which wasn't even half the amount of my full ticket price. This had to be cleared with the airline, I was told by the agent. It's been two months and I still haven't seen a dime. I have also spent hours online, during my much-needed vacation on the cost of being with my family, trying to find a new return ticket, just to find out that a one-way ticket is three times more expensive than the price of a roundtrip ticket. I called the airline, telling them to fix me a return ticket, which they of course could not at all do! Even though they were the ones cancelling my return, they could and would not help me. So, here I am sitting day after day looking for cheap flights back home to Canada. This trip will be horribly expensive in the end, thanks to the airline, which clearly does not know what customer service is. I am left all alone to fix myself. My trip was supposed to be three months, and I can only imagine if I had stayed for only a couple of weeks. It's been a complete nightmare and I will never ever use this airline again. I'd rather spend a little more money going with someone else, and I check reviews on all of them now. I still do not have a return ticket or received a refund. I'm royally angry and cannot express how dissatisfied I am. I can honestly say I have so far spent two full working weeks with this problem, talking, online chatting and spending time online to search for a new return ticket. It's been hell and having this horrible ""cloud"" of uncertainty hanging over my head this entire trip. I've even lost a few nights' sleep because of it. Will I do more travel in the future?

Despite my attempts to seek a resolution, I have yet to receive a response from their airline. I discovered that the baggage I had already paid for was not showing in the system. Consequently, I was charged an additional amount by the airline for the same baggage. In an effort to rectify this unjust charge, I promptly contacted the customer service and was advised to file a claim through a provided link. I followed the instructions and submitted my claim accordingly, expecting a prompt response and resolution. However, to my disappointment, I have yet to receive any communication or refund regarding this matter. No one will address this issue that I have been incorrectly charged.

29,Ethan Oppenlander,United States,2023-06-15,1,"This was the absolute worst flying experience of my life. I have flown to and from Europe several times, generally sticking to Lufthansa but this time I chose to fly SAS. SAS cancelled one of our flights 2 weeks before leaving, they offered only one choice for replacement, which required a 16 hour layover in Chicago. I chose to accept it since rescheduling would have been very expensive and my wife was 7 months pregnant. The flight had 2 stops and due to the continuous changing of our tickets our layovers were changed to 45 minutes (originally 3 hours). This caused my wife and I to miss a connecting flight to Amsterdam, SAS offered a replacement flight which had another stop in Oslo, along with another 10 hours of combined layover. They offered a 10$ coupon so we could eat in the airport, which covers basically nothing, which didn't even work in the end. That wasn't all though, on the return flight one of our return tickets was canceled 3 days before returning. After several phone calls we got this resolved. A day before leaving we checked our flight information in the app and our tickets disappeared again. after several more hours of stress and fighting to get home we managed to get our tickets resolved along with another 10+ hours of layover. We didn't even get our reserved seats we paid extra for. After all of this SAS has no customer service and they won't refund anything for their continuous failures. 0/10 do not recommend.

30,P Hayne,Norway,2023-06-14,2,"SAS customer service needs major improvement. For starters, I’ve spoke to 4 different representative and out of 4, 3 didnt wanted to help. They simply serve the information without any further suggestions to what can be done and bounce it onto someone else. At the airport, the representative denied me boarding and told me to call SAS phone number to get rebooked which was within my right and also on the ticket that I bought. I don’t disagree with him but his attitude was rather dismissive. He did at least confirm that he put a note on my profile for rebooking. It took over 2 hours on hold. At which point, the “rebook before 1 hour” option was no longer available. The agent at least tried to rebook and could not. I asked if she saw the note the airport representative put, for some reason, the last note was not there. I asked if she would make a note. She confirmed she did. The recommendation was to book a flight and then file a complaint to say I’ve waited for 2 hours on the phone and if it was done immediately, it would of been fine. I tried to look into options. At this point in time, the ticket was a blowing mind of over 31000 nok! Not happening, can’t afford this. I called them again and after over 2 hours on hold, decided for the next day. The next day, I managed to get someone on chat. I asked to see if there was any recommendations because I can only see prices that are quite unreasonable. She said, “prices are as is on the website”. The next question was, can you please confirm if you see the notes made by your other two colleagues which she did not respond. I then ask about how the filing of complaint work, which she simply said (along the lines of), “they’ll look into it”. The next question was, “how long will it take?” The response was, something along the lines of longer than 2 weeks but we’re not committing to any time. All the responses were quite dismissive. For starter, the first and last agent didn’t really try to help but rather just tried to shrug me off. I understand there might of not been much they can do, but the experience and the way the responses were handle was right out of the book or just dismissive of help. Also, where are all the notes that people can’t confirm they’re seeing from past conversations? Not please with waiting over 2 hours on calls on two occasions and customer services and SAS members answering from a book with no attention to services or customer satisfaction. Onboard services were fine. No bad experiences onboard.

Their excuse was simply that on their system the flight I wanted to change to was more than twice that advertised on the website. When I asked for them to explain this difference they put me on hold for 10 minutes, then hung up. Inexcusable behavior that I have also reported this to ARN.

55,Craig Cutts,United Kingdom,2023-03-07,6,"Not used SAS for sometime their European business class product is called SAS Plus, check in at T2 Heathrow quick and polite as was security. I used the United lounge as the flight was departing from the B gates so nice lounge, boarding organised i had seat 1A so quickly to my seat on a new A320 Neo. Departed a bit late once in the air a small breakfast served which was actually fine, grew polite through the 2 hour flight which arrived on time. Had a few hours lay over in Stockholm before departing on a small CRJ again seat 1A pretty comfortable service fine with a snack and drink offered on the 50 minute flight which arrived on time. Returning check in again very quick as was security, although I have Frequent Flyer status SAS do not offer lounge access at Tallinn which isn't great considering the cost of these flights! Although the airport is very nice so no problem. Boarded by bus on to an ATR which was a great experience having never flown one before, business or plus seating is at the rear and seat was comfortable. Service again fine for 50 minutes, arrived just about on time, transfer time being 3 hours I used the SAS lounge and eventually the SAS Gold lounge which are probably the worst lounges in the Star Alliance, boarding the final flight was late and flight delayed due to poor weather but once in the air service pretty good across the 2 hour flight. Lounges apart SAS offered a normal European business class service, i don't mind the food in cardboard boxes on short flights saves a lot of waste. The crew on the final flight were great, I would use SAS again although would look at others first if paying a business class fare.",A320/CRJ/ATR,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Tallinn via Stockholm,March 2023,4.0,5.0,3.0,,3.0,,3,yes,True,London,Tallinn,Stockholm
56,Gabor David,Norway,2023-02-26,4,"Unfortunately only a few positive things were experienced during this quite expensive (12000 kr for 3 persons) round trip. The most important, that we are at home safe. The SAS lounge at OSL is quite mediocre, no warm breakfast, limited cold cuts, no cakes etc. Wifi was not working, though on the route back it was working well. Breakfast on the plane was ridiculous, there was a 2nd servering as well. On the way back the lunch was ok, child menu was better than ours. No middle seat empty, its quite annoying for this kind of price. Crew was nice, back-route they were bored fair enough. Everybody could use the front loo, Lufthansa only lets the biz pax use the front loo, no privacy on biz class at all. There is no lounge use at ALC, its a big shame of SAS, especially for this price. Only one line for biz class at ALC at the check-in for SAS. No onboard magazine, plus the downloadable magazines/newspapers are very limited. Onboard printed menu is very limited, too, at least for the biz class they could have a separate menu with better options. Why all of these critics?

I don't know how many people can suddenly travel a day earlier with under 24 hours notice but I am not one them. Like most travellers (probably), 24 hours is also too little notice to change my itinerary. The only positive I can say is that the website allows you to get a refund or cancel your booking easily, without needing to waste more time on the phone. The original fare was reasonable but not at ""budget"" airlines levels where you expect this level of negligence.

For this trip, we travelled with only hand luggage. As such, we were able to check in via the app and head straight to the lounge at Newark - thanks to the upgrade to SAS Plus (Premium Economy). We also had access arriving in Copenhagen. Was a nice perk to be able to take a shower and grab a bite before catching the connection to Rome. On the outbound to Copenhagen, the Plus seats onboard the SAS A350 were comfortable, wider, and had a decent recline and padding. One thing that was consistent about SAS on all our sectors was their punctuality. Every flight boarded early, pushed back on time and arrived early. The service onboard in SAS Plus was very good, the crew were very friendly and all smiles. Seemed to enjoy their work. The 2 meals were also very good, well presented and with free alcohol, pre-dinner drinks and also free wifi. The amenity kit was a shoe bag with a toothbrush and eyeshades, etc. A bit cheap in execution but might get some use out of it later. While the crew on the other sectors were also very friendly, there was a stark contrast in what you actually get in regular old economy. On the flight to and from Rome, it was just a cup of coffee with everything else including water available for purchase. On the flight back to Newark from Copenhagen, we flew on SAS' A321NX. It felt new, the seats were comfortable, legroom was decent. But being on a fully packed narrow body plane for 8 hours starts to wear on you a lot quicker than on the A350. With only 3 toilets all at the back, there was a constant stream of people up and down the aisle. The dinner and arrival snack service were slow and the meals themselves were somewhat basic. I thought the limit of just one drink with the meal was a bit cheap on the airline's part. Additional snacks and drinks were available throughout the flight but once again had to be purchased. As did wifi access in economy. The entertainment system was responsive and I did like the tail and belly cams on the A350, which were not available on the A321. Otherwise, the selection of movies and TV shows was small and dated. As I had booked this ticket about 4 months before, I was able to score a great fare deal which made it good value.

All receipt photos were uploaded in original claim case, but they asked for them again by email. Then continued to tell me (weeks apart each time) that the images weren’t visible. Poor English so difficult to understand what they meant by not visible. Resent 4 times in various formats to be told after 3 months that they had to be in PDF form (I had taken images on iphone which is normally fine).

91,U Santer,United States,2022-09-09,1,"San Francisco to Gothenburg via Copenhagen. I had a flight booked for departure on 7th September 2022 from SFO to GOT. I called the SAS customer service number on Friday morning September 2nd 2022, to add my pet fee since I was planning on flying with him. The customer service guy helped me and that was billed to my debit card. That day when I called back customer service with more questions, and waited on hold for an hour before getting a person to pick up. She would answer one question, and if I asked more she would hang up on me. Yes, this is SAS customer service. They hang up on customers. Anyway, on Tuesday September 6th 2022 I called SAS customer service to ask if I could have the pet fee refunded since the pet's travel documents were not all available and I had decided to leave him with someone else while I’m gone. The lady at customer service that day said that was alright, that the amount would be refunded without any issues if I fill out a form on the website. I filled out the form, and got an email response saying I can’t get a refund even though my pet was never on that flight. This gets worse. On the 7th September 2022, I arrived at the SFO airport at 3:05pm I remember checking my phone for time, I got to the SAS check in desk, and the ladies there completely ignored me. I went to see if there was more desks for SAS check in, and there was none, so I came back. When I came back to the SAS check in, these ladies turned around and left the desk at 3:15pm. The flight was departing at 4:25pm. These ladies never bothered to announce for any more customers checking in before leaving and to make matters worse, they left earlier than they should have. According to SAS customer service that I talked to the next morning, SAS check in is supposed to leave their desk an hour before departure meaning they should have left at 3:25pm the earliest, and at least announce before they leave for any last calls. The fact that I was standing in front of their desk and waving and yelling to get their attention, but they still turned around and left was beyond me. Even worse was the customer service the next day that would hang up on me while I was speaking. This airline has me at a loss for words for the amount of disregard for the customer. For a company that claims that customer service is their priority, yet still treat a customer the way they treated me, I wonder how they treat their employees and everything else that goes into the quality of their service. Maybe that is why their employees treat the customers so badly. Maybe they are not happy. I know this has been the absolute worst airline experience in my entire life! I have flown so many times before and no airline has ever been this terrible with their customer.

I have flown from Longyearbyen to Oslo dozens of times and SAS never fail to disappoint; Longyearbyen airport can only handle one aircraft and one aircraft worth of passengers at any one time, so why SAS chose to have 2 flight departing within 2.5 hours of one another is beyond me. The result? Two flights worth of passengers trying to check in at the same time, only one staffed check in desk, nobody around to help passengers who are having trouble using the self service check in system, security totally overwhelmed, nobody taking charge to sort the shambolic chaos, just inanely optimistic PA announcements asking those on the later flight in the security queue to 'step aside' - where to? The security area is too narrow to step anywhere! 2 hours and 15 minutes to check in and get through security! To add insult to injury, SAS cabin crew within Norway seem to enjoy standing at the end of the aisle while passengers struggle to get luggage into the overhead bins-everyone was stressed enough as it was after the dreadful security and check in experience, so a bit of help would have been nice, but no. Then the Tromso customs clearance pantomime - if you have a tight connection at Oslo and you are flying from Longyearbyen via Tromso, forget it - you almost certainly won't make it - or if by some miracle you do, you will be sweaty and stressed by the time you have sprinted the full length of Oslo airport. So, you have to clear customs at Tromso if arriving from Longyearbyen - SAS check in staff at Longyearbyen tell me I have to take hold baggage off and check it in again at Tromso. SAS cabin crew tell me I don't need to do this, just take off hand baggage and clear customs. SAS ground crew at Tromso say they are not sure!! Thankfully the passport control staff knew the answer, but beware, Tromso airport is currently undergoing redevelopment, so we had to queue for over half an hour in the rain to get to what I can only describe as two shipping containers welded together where passport control is currently located. Over an hour to get to the passport control point. 55 minutes scheduled for the stop in Tromso, and guess what? Almost 2 hours later the pantomime is over, everyone is stressed out and many people onboard now know they have zero chance of making their connection at Oslo. Oslo to London smoother, but this is operated by another arm of SAS who have their act together a bit more it seems. But why oh why do SAS at Oslo insist on showing the boarding gate on the screen, allow passengers to head into the gate lounge, only to then rudely boot them out of the gate lounge and make them queue again to get into the gate lounge - this happens every time! Why? Just don't allow passengers in until you are ready! This isn't rocket science SAS!

However, it turned out to be quite a lackluster experience. I really liked the plane, and as many have stated in the past, you do feel much better after a long-haul on the A350, compared to other aircraft. When it comes to more negative findings, there is unfortunately quite a lot. First off, the food, which was back to full normal service, was simply not up to standards. The salmon starter should have been cooked for 5-10 minutes, not 5-10 hours! The so called salad, which cost 10 cents to produce, was not very attractive. The wine list was decent, even more so if you get the red you order, and not something else from the list. The IFE was appealing from a technical perspective, but contents left a lot be desired, especially new films and music. The staff was somewhat standoffish and aloof, and many of them did not seem to enjoy their jobs one bit. Priority baggage is not not a known concept at LAX. I had to wait for all other bags to come through before the priority-tagged bags appeared on the belt.

It is probably the most comfortable seat I have ever flown on. It was really spacious, had much leg room, and was very well padded which made the seat extremely nice to sit on. The crew was really nice, and the plane had a very modern feeling. I really like that SAS offers youth-fares, for a much cheaper tickets for young adults. The pretty cheap fares (in difference to other star alliance members) makes the experience even nicer. I recommend SAS, Thumbs up from me!

First, they had no signs at the entrance to the ticketing lines indicating economy passenger vs. Gold Card, Business lines. I wondered if this was the reason for the Gold Card/Business line being so long. The second unpleasantry was the ticketing agent asking me three times whether I alone had packed my bags. This interrogation might have been customary 25 years ago, but I was taken aback on this recent occasion. I finally asserted that one ""yes"" should be sufficient. The third unpleasantry was the 1000 Krone charge for the Attestation form at the gate. While I admit that this form was my responsibility, this form probably only cost the airline about 10 Krone to produce. After paying more than $1900 for my ticket, one could assert that SAS was either petty or punitive or both for making such a charge. The final complaint had to do with a responsibility that was mine, but about SAS could be much more helpful. My ticket was listed as a P class ticket on all legs. I had connecting flights with United. The small print at the bottom of the second page notes that Premium economy flights revert to Economy on code share (non-SAS) legs.

At 7.45, we finally left. The stewardess deliberately ignored us during the flight, skipping us and avoiding eye contact as coffee was served. Not that I care, but I found it a very childish gesture.

If you are of average height, and the person in front of you reclines his/her chair, you can no longer properly see the IFE screen. Moreover, you are cramped into something that best can be compared to a vise. Its terribly a horrifying experience for 9 hours. Of course, to add insult to injury, SAS transatlantic service is not comparable to a regular airline when it comes to anything else either: food, beverages, IFE selection. It's much closer resembling RyanAir than, say, KLM or Lufthansa. But when you are stuck in the type of seating I was, that really doesn't matter. All you will want is to get out of there.

SAS would not allow us to cancel our flights or even get a credit for a later flight, we had to rebook and pick a new date immediately - during the pandemic.  Check in at CPH was a nightmare. We had our CDC approved BiomaxNOW test results (NEG). But when we went to the counter. The agent told us SAS did not accept them. (Their StarAlliance partner UNITED does). Agent also asked for our vaccine cards? (Not a US requirement). We raced to get an airport COVID test at significant additional cost and inconvenience. We went to the checkin line and got a different agent who barely even reviewed our test status and never asked for our vaccine cards, much to our dismay. On board experience is fine, the A350 is an amazing jet. We left a few minutes late (no explanation) and took off. The meal in SAS Go was fine, but SAS makes sure to inform passengers several times you get one free drink and must pay for alcohol and snacks. (It's an 8 hour flight). Oh but make sure your USB port is not being used on takeoff.  Our outbound journey was a even bigger disaster. The night before, SAS cancelled our non stop to CPH and routed us on BA thru London, with an airline and terminal change at Heathrow. Not even a thru connection on BA, we were SAS Plus.

And then, on the trip back, they went a step further and assigned us the worst possible location, exactly in the center of a 4-seat setup, in the middle of the plane. I called the customer service who suggested that I ask about it at the check-in counter at LAX, they in turn said that I should speak to someone at the gate where they asked me to call the customer service!

Nobody was willing to answer why I paid for seat selection for no apparent reason and why I wasn't at least offered a refund for the non-existing ""service"" I purchased as an extra when they decided to change my booking details without even letting me know.

Not knowing the next airport and trying to navigate it adds time with this unnecessary occurrence makes it even more worrisome. Once we boarded pilot came on intercom and seem to make a joke about it. Assuring us not to worry about it. That did not make us feel too good. At this point we decided to talk tot he flight attendants. They would not answer any questions and appeared to be aggravated we even talk to them. We were ordered to our seats. We complied and settled in. Once flight got off ground and beverage service began request for drinks began. We did not understand them and the attendant refused to discuss. Finally we got drinks requested with them throwing them on our tray. Once we landed the trouble began. We had to run through the airport not knowing if we were going in the right direction or not. It was a nightmare and we were wet from perspiring we we reached our gates. It was just in the Nick of time. We remained optimistic about this one. It was not to be. We received the exact same treatment on this flight too. In ways it was worse with the attendants being down right rude at times. We received the same treatment for beverage and food service and they actually ignored my wife. Had it not been for the person sitting beside her, she would not have been served.

Did I not understand that? Strike 4: Later meetings at work made 15.30 impossible. The original 17.00 would still have been OK, but I had to go for 18.50 ruining evening plans. Plus Pro gives change or cancelation without any fees over Plus, but online I got a 600 NOK fee. Strike 5: Contacting support again with estimated wait of 21 minutes, even with EBG priority. That was too long even without priority. The extraordinary situation creating long wait times have lasted for several years with SAS. Strike 6: Callback for support was not working. Understood that after waiting 35 minutes in vain for the callback. Strike 7: Calling in and identifying with my frequent flyer number my 40 minutes wait was ignored and I was but in the back of the line. Strike 8: After over 1 hour I was told that I should  not pay the fee. I should receive a link to pay for the change. I received a link for payment and there the 600 NOK fee was added again. Strike 9: I contacted support again and was explained that even if the difference between Plus and Plus Pro was fees for changes my Pros Pro booking had the fee as there was a promotion when I bought the ticket. So it basically was a Plus and not a Plus Pro ticket even if my booking says something else. Strike 10: With a price difference of 3 NOK between the 15.30 and 18.50 flights I had to pay 1364 NOK for the change. Strike 11: After getting my final booking I checked it online with no seating selected as expected and then selected 5A. Checked in online, boarded after some delay through the gate and thought everything was OK. No word or message from SAS. After being seated someone else also turned up with 5A on his boarding pass. Strike 12: Crew arrived to assist and I was asked if I has changed flight. Yes, I said, but I had selected a seat for this flight and heard nothing from SAS. Well, that is not how it works with SAS I was told. If my original booking is changed selecting a seat on the new flight is of no use as SAS was going to move me again to a random seat anyway. I had to move to 14D in regular economy and that was it. Strike 13: With others complaining they contacted SAS and had the seating corrected during the flight. Got to 5A and the other guy could move back to his girlfriend, which he preferred. I heard no one saying sorry and have not heard from SAS weeks after the event. Strike 14: Food and drink service for Plus was choosing from the snack trolley. Muffins? Chips? A chocolate bar? Strike 15: Same seats in Plus and in Go and 3 persons shoulder to shoulder. Strike 16: No WiFi service even if SAS promised this on all planes years ago. 1 of my last 6 flights had WiFi. Usual response is ""Oh, we do have WiFi on this plane, but it does not work"".",A320 neo,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Oslo to Tromsø,January 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Oslo,Tromsø,

146,W Denten,Norway,2022-01-09,2,"I have used SAS multiple times and always dirty aircrafts and unpolite flight attendants. On December the 21st my experience with SAS was brought to the next level when after landing it seemed that my backpack got stolen with lots of important things inside it. I fell asleep during the flight since I had a short night and woke up after landing. I was not in a rush to get out as I was still waking up, had almost 5h time for connection flight and due new Covid variant I didn´t feel like to get in the crowd. So I read the news on my phone while passengers were stepping out. Than the fun started after finding only empty cabinets. The flight attendants only could say that I had to hurry to get out the aircraft and didn´t give any advise. At the service desk they only said that I had to go to found and lost (missing X) to register my lost item there. Later on I found out that SAS should give me a case number since this incident happened on the aircraft but they are refusing. Customer service is refusing to give me a PIR number and says I need to contact in Oslo the service desk. I did this multiple times and also on my return home I visit them live but they keep on refusing. Customer service is doing the same. I have to consider my backpack as lost since also the police has dropped the case. Flight companies should start to understand that a travel insurance is not always the solution because some things just can´t be replaced. The flight attendants at SAS have a true Scandinavian mentality. If it doesn´t involve them, they really don´t care. I´m a Dutch living in Norway and most people in the Scandinavian countries are raised that you should not interfere with other people business and this applies also on business level. So a good customer service you really can forget with SAS. I have now decided to use only KLM. This companies has its flaws too but the flight attendants do upper most their best that passengers are not sneaking around during the flight. Side note, the flight from Bodo to Oslo the aircraft was rather empty in the back. During stepping out there were 2 flight attendants in the back.

153,H Lee,United States,2021-12-15,1,"Today, while I was at work, I received a phone call from the airport, asking me whether my family and I will be boarding our flight. I was shocked and confused, as I booked our reservations for a departure on Thursday, December 16 from LAX. Still on the phone with the airport, I went back to double check all of my documents, which all showed our departure date as December 16. Anxious and confused, I spoke to a representative on the phone from SAS. I was shocked when she told me that my flight had been rescheduled, without my permission or confirmation, to two days earlier on December 14. The SAS representative informed me that I should have received an email notifying me of this schedule change. Unfortunately, the email in question was sent directly to my spam folder, and I was never made aware of the major schedule change. She told me that upon receipt of the email, I had only a 15-day window to confirm the new schedule. However, of course, because I was not even aware that I received any sort of email notification, I was unable to consider or confirm the schedule change. Unfortunately, to my utter disappointment in the company, SAS took my silence as approval for the new departure date, which is both ridiculous and deceiving. Moreover, after hours on the phone with two separate representatives from SAS, I was told that because I was not on board the first December 14 flight, all of my money and bookings were completely lost and unrecoverable, including both departure and return flights. It is completely outrageous that I am not even granted the right to my return flights (Zurich to Copenhagen and Copenhagen to LAX), which are not dependent at all on the flights that were rescheduled by the airline, and all of which I have already paid for. Because I have spent over four months planning my two-week stay in Switzerland with family, and because SAS deceptively cancelled my entire air travel itinerary, after I first learned about a schedule change only 2 days before my planned departure, I have been forced to completely rebook all of my flights. Because I had to book new flights on such short notice, and because of limited space this close to my trip, I was given no choice but to pay four times the cost of my original booking with SAS, which has placed my family in a financial burden and has stolen the joy and excitement from our long-awaited holiday trip. I believe the only possible way for SAS to redeem itself in this shrewd and unfair situation is to refund the entire cost of our family's SAS booking, including taxes, fees, and additional baggage, as well as offer some sort of financial compensation for the extremely high prices we were forced to pay for new last-minute flights.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Zurich,December 2021,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Los Angeles,Zurich,

Constant delays, every flight I've traveled with this company over the last few years have been delayed one way or another, whether its domestic flight or international. they have been delayed all of them. I understand that things can happen before during or when landing that can cause delay. but when its happened every time i fly with them, I've reached the end of my patience. In the last trip i took with this AL (12th of July - 31th of July (Was suppose to be the 30th) but because of delay i had to spend the night at an airport hotel. Roughly a week before my first flight, my trip's return date got rebooked, and with covid happening and quarantine being a thing i chose the specific return date for the quarantine, and the rebook date was making it so that the last day of quarantine would be the first day of my job. So i was trying to reach the support line several days in a row, spending several hours on hold to get help - I never did get through to them. On my way to the destination with this company just a few weeks ago the flight was delayed to Oslo by over 30 minutes. now these 30 minutes were crucial to make it to the connecting flight which i didn't make and because of that i had to go back out and through to checkin to get help again.  I dashed through the airport in hopes to make it, but to no avail. The airline had no more flights to my destination. the issue for me isn't the direct thing that i missed that flight but the lack of preparation for these situations, whether they hold the flight for just a few minutes for the people on the flight that have connecting flights with the same company or quicker assistance in said situation instead of having to run around the entire airport just to get help.

There was some kind of biscuit available for purchase and soft drinks were also available to buy. The reason for this lack of service was cited to be (surprise, surprise, Covid). The airline claims to want to avoid too much contact between crew and passengers. Although SAS's flight attendants seem considerably older than the industry average, they are hardly in the vulnerable-age category and their protection does not seem warranted.

One of the crew members, a large heavyset young man, was incredibly zealous about the detailed enforcement of Covid safety rules to the point where the behaviour reminded me of that found inside the Swedish penitentiary system, which is a ""nice"" Scandinavian touch, as offensive as it is. For example: one is not allowed to change seats at any time, even if it would improve social distancing, if sleeping while your facemask is not covering your nose and mouth you will be woken from sleep and ordered to correct that grievous error, the order in which groups of rows embark or disembark makes no difference at all to overall Covid infection risk, due to no distancing during the flight.

Boarding/security procedures are a nightmare at Berlin Tegel because of the terminal design. At Stockholm they are more organized, and I got to use the fast track because of my SAS plus ticket. Lufthansa lounge at Berlin was decent, although the SAS lounge in Stockholm was better. Seating on board (6F on the first flight, and 5F on the second) was comfortable enough, and had enough legroom. Both times I had assigned myself in row 1, but moved because I was able to get a row of 3 seats to myself. Crew on both flights were very professional and accommodating with respect to my Autism and sensory issues. Internet was free with the SAS plus ticket, and worked well when it worked. I ordered a lacto-ovo vegetarian meal, and both times it was great - some kind of wheat salad on the first flight and a cheese plate on the second. There was free alcohol. Would definitely recommend SAS and definitely buy SAS Plus next time as it was a great value considering what was included in the very small difference in price - 2 bags, priority security/baggage handling, lounge access, seating at the front of the plane, a cold meal, and alcohol - and, as a cherry on top, unlike the cheaper fares that were being offered when I booked, it earned a good number of miles seeing as it booked in to ""A"" class.",A319,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Berlin to Stockholm,February 2020,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,True,Berlin,Stockholm,

My complaint about the whole situation is that SAS forced all the passengers to stay on Stavanger airport to go with flight SK1877 to Copenhagen (a flight that departed eventually at 00:50) I didnt want to go to Copenhagen in the first place, because I needed to go to Amsterdam and I rather stayed in Stavanger to get booked on a direct flight later that day. (several direct flights leaving stavanger to amsterdam). There was no way of contacting the SAS customer service by phone (tried several times) and no SAS deck at the airport in reach. Now I was forced to go Copenhagen where I was further away from home and in a bigger mess because of the strikes at Copenhagen, well known to SAS. At arrival they gave us no information and no rebooking on next flights. A hotel voucher was offered for a hotel that is 40 minutes away from the airport (in a different city) and a phone number for the SAS customer service to call after 07:00 a.m. I had to book a flight with another airline just to get out of Copenhagen, with my suitcase lost in the pile of other bagage at Copenhagen airport. I'm travelling a lot and have encountered many delays and cancelled flights, but this is the worst service I have ever seen with any airline. Even after the difficult online process of getting refunds for my flights, the official answer of SAS is that their process time is 4 weeks. I feel mistreated. This a problem that should be addressed. ",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Stavanger to Amsterdam via Copenhagen,September 2019,3.0,3.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Stavanger,Amsterdam,Copenhagen

I originally flew from Vienna, with connecting flight from Copenhagen to Chicago via SAS. I checked in online before boarding, and everything looked ok, but when I got to Copenhagen and wanted to check on my flight as I had an almost 7-hour layover, I had to check in again. I went to the SAS customer service desk to get boarding passes and to ask for their lounge as I paid for it. They told me, the luggage was ticketed wrong, but they will fix it and put it on the right flight. Took the numbers of my tickets, seen photos of my luggage (thank God I took them before leaving) and she reassured me, they will be on the flight with me. Came to Chicago and only 2 out of my 3 bags arrived (it was me and 2 kids, so one bag for each). I went to the SAS luggage claim which was Wednesday, and they told me I should get it most likely by Friday. Well, Friday came, I received a notification that the flight with my luggage landed, but that was the last of it. I called Saturday, but nobody was there. I called the 800 number, but they were less than helpful, and the guy even hung up on me, when I tried to find a different number on how to contact them. I mean, they have flights on Saturday as well, so if the customer service does not operate in the airport on Saturday, where the people claim their luggage if lost? So, I rather stick with Lufthansa, but for sure I will not fly again with SAS.

SAS does everything to give you the worst possible service on economy - low cost carriers like Ryan Air or easyJet are a blessing in comparison - in order to fleece you with their premium options.

The main issue is that the flight was cancelled at 10PM, and no service and support from the airline at all was provided until calling the hotline the next morning at 9AM. Outside the legally obligated food vouchers delivered via a contractor at the airport. That lack of care and support led to the early morning flight offered by SAS to be fully booked out by normal customers and we with our cancelled flight were left with an afternoon flight which had huge consequential damages in terms of lost connections for us. I find it appalling that an airline cares so little about its customers that new paying customers still have priority over your cancelled trip and also from a legal perspective the airline definitely failed its duty to try and get you from A to B in face of cancellation as fast as possible. Needless to say the options for remedy with support proved completely inflexible. Almost fraudulently, I also found out SAS uses different booking codes and Airlines to get out of legal responsibilities, apparently our other trip in the journey was booked with Scandinavian which is a different airline than SAS and therefore SAS refused a refund for this part of the journey. While I certainly agreed to conditions on ticket and have no legal recourse this sort of skulduggery is clearly set up by the airline to make your life as miserable as possible and force you to book their premium priced options if you want proper service.

I was informed of this cancellation by email that I was booked on an earlier flight, making the transit in Stockholm even longer (10 hours in fact). I tried calling the Euro Bonus service desk. It was busy and I eventually got through to a customer agent who told me that they didn't have other flights than the one I got rebooked on and that he had to check if I can get booked on another airline and that I had to wait on the line. I was left waiting for half an hour. This is unacceptable. I eventually had trips (on other airlines) from Oslo Gardermoen airport, and each time I was there, I asked the ticket desk staff if they could help me.

This is very generous when the likes of LH and BA are cramming in 6 business class seats in the same space. The seat has plenty of leg room (go with the even numbers to get a seat with no gap to the window). The IFE has a pretty decent selection of the latest movies (though the audio channel only had 6 channels). The lie-flat bed has plenty of privacy, a soft cover excellent duvet and pillow. WiFi was excellent throughout for sending and receiving emails- The staff get all togged up in their white chef's outfits to serve the food - nice touch. On both legs I had the best vodka cranberry cocktail that I can ever remember with warmed nuts. This was followed by one of my favourite Swedish starters salmon roe, creme fraiche, red onions in a glass jar. Both the main and dessert were excellent as well.

Friendly, attentive staff and a clean plane. However, on my flight today (11/21), from Athens to Copenhagen, I experienced the worst customer service of my life. I was waiting very patiently for the restroom, when a flight attendant, who at this point had not noticed me, went to check to see if the bathroom was open. Upon realizing it was not, she glanced back, saw me waiting and pulled the curtain shut, hitting my face with it (no apology or acknowledgement of wrongdoing).

When the gentleman in front of me left the restroom, she opened the curtain for him to return to his seat. I started towards the bathroom, at this point more confused than upset. The flight attendant proceeded to put her hand in my face, getting within an inch of me, and said “no, wait” and proceeded to go to the restroom herself. I can understand needing to use the restroom. I can understand needing to go before a paying customer if it was time to prepare for landing (which it was not, we were roughly 2 hours into a 3 hour flight).

311,Kyle Johnson,Sweden,2018-10-03,2,"Stockholm to Frankfurt. Unfortunately SAS and its hub Arlanda airport get only worse. Regarding check-in, long a problem spot for SAS/Star Alliance at Arlanda Terminal 5, it is clear that throughput far exceeds the capacity of the staff/facilities to move customers through. For Star Alliance flights the presence of the self-drop counters continues to serve no function, as they cannot be used for transfers conducted by partner airlines. (Why? A mystery). This yields a situation where 7-8 counters are backed up with a 30 minutes+ queue, bag drop off queues are blended with check-in queues, and self drop off queues stand essentially empty as the system itself precludes their use. This combination provides a tremendous delay. A 5 minute process becomes 40+ owing to poor management and poor implementation of SAS resources, yielding great frustration with SAS and Star Alliance, particularly ironic given how utterly smoothly SAS-partner Lufthansa’s hubs are run. SAS/Arlanda have some serious benchmarking and reorganization to do.

312,M Taputi,Indonesia,2018-10-02,1,"Stockholm to Copenhagen. My family and I were treated unfairly upon on this flight. We purchased 4 SAS Plus tickets but when we boarded the plane, we were shocked to learn that 3 of us were assigned to one row while other SAS Plus passengers in front of us, beside us and for several rows behind us received an empty seat in between two seats. The seating reassignment was essentially a downgrade because of overbooking without any compensation. When we checked-in, we were asked by the staff at the check-in counter whether or not we wanted to take the earlier flight. Since we made arrangements to meet our tour guide later, we did not agree and politely refused. The staff was then on the phone for several minutes before being able to print our boarding passes. We were not told of the change in seating arrangement and only found out on the plane. Being the only family onboard the plane that received this treatment, it felt as though we were treated unfairly because we were travelling as a family and was a traumatic experience for us. After emailing SAS customer service, all we received was an apology.

Both the flight from the US to Copenhagen, and back to the US were exactly on time - no delays. Check in and baggage check went smoothly with no problems. In-flight service was great, all flight attendants were friendly. We found the food to be tasty and the meal service was very good. The seats on the A330 were roomy and comfortable. The seats on the commuter A320 (from Copenhagen to Stockholm) were surprisingly roomy - they were scaled down and not as ""cushy"" as other 320s, but that scaling down gave us extra leg room.

I asked her whether she had informed the ground staff, but she said she has no connection with ground. I arrived in terminal without assistance, had to rung the long corridor to my gate while hearing my names was being called throughout the terminal.

Once I boarded the plane, it was announced that “boarding completed”. On the way back from Tokyo Narita to Copenhagen, the cabin crew wasn’t really professional. The connection flight to Berlin Tegel had another delay. There wasn’t any explanation at all nor apology on why the flights were delayed, even though I wrote a review at their website.

321,Jacob Kollar,Netherlands,2018-08-18,5,"Amsterdam to Klaipeda via Copenhagen. In 2001 I took took a flight with SAS from Amsterdam to Stockholm and enjoyed one of the best short haul flights I had experienced. Great food, great service, great comfort. But, that was 17 years ago. As traditional airlines have cut costs in relation to competition from budget alternatives, I would have to say, of the airlines I've used, SAS have compromised their product the most. The only way they differentiate themselves from budget airlines when flying short-haul, is you get a little bit of extra leg room—and free coffee and tea on flights over 80 minutes. The boarding situation was fairly chaotic, full flights on both AMS to CPH and on the return leg. On this occasion I travelled with my physically disabled child who requires extra assistance. Despite communicating this this ahead of time, outbound, they were completely unprepared, and we had to wrestle a bit to have our needs met. They also had us board last, which was extremely awkward and difficult for the passengers that had already boarded. On the return leg however, they were excellent. Airport staff were ready to meet us and transport us to the connecting flight. With regard to this, and in general, the cabin staff were friendly and helpful. The A320's on both legs were not well cleaned. Slightly grimy throughout the cabin. The plane used for the CPH to AMS flight was particularly bad. During taxiing, the cabin was bombarded with what could best be described as horrible low pitched squeal. In contrast however, the CRJ900's were both very well maintained (operated by City Jet). In summary, as previously alluded to, it seems this airline is barely above budget status these days. At times, that little bit extra shone through, but for the most part, it was functional, it got us where we needed to go, but it is not worth the extra few €'s that you usually have to pay to fly with them. It's stuck between the two worlds, and it doesn't really fulfil either's criteria.",A320 / CRJ900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Klaipeda via Copenhagen,August 2018,3.0,4.0,2.0,,3.0,,2,no,True,Amsterdam,Klaipeda,Copenhagen

The departure should originally be from Split at. 10.10, 21 July 2018. Intermediate in Stockholm, and so on to Oslo. Arrival 14.35. It goes without saying that costumer service at SAS closes at. 19, and does not open until 9 days after. Split airport is one of the worst in the world. No doubt. I'm promised that if I want, I'll have to get a baggage in Stockholm. The departure will be moved to 12.15. It's over 2 hours of waiting without seating. I'm sitting on the floor for 2 hours. The plane is coming. On board we meet with happy and satisfied people. We are informed that the delay is due to crewet's rest. There is no stand by crew. For it is now everyone is settling their vacation. It is nice. We land and I rush to find a transfer service center. Arlanda has unfortunately no signs. I have gone wrong twice. There is absolutely no one who has been waiting for us or given us any information, it takes a long time before we understand we have to draw a number. But what should you press? The lady in the counter is alone and gets very angry that we are wrong. I get a new boarding card and a message that I will have to stay overnight. Now I have to go to the luggage hall and talk to the costumer service there. There is no costumer service there, just baggage help. The lady still giving me a sticker with reference to the hotel - 3 course dinner she says. I would like my baggage. Neeeej, I can not get that. I get totally desperate. Not even a tan brush. She gives me a bag. It will help. No, I do not want to scold out, she just says yes. Yes. Yes. I'm coming to the hotel, I'm told that dinner we can not get before 20.30. The hotel has more important guests. Kl. is 16.00. What's the matter with these people !! There I belong in addition to other passengers that they could get their luggage out without any problems. The following day we arrive in Oslo. I'm 20 hours late. When we leave the plane there is a friendly young man with a sign - transfer. They can do that enough in Oslo. I also notice the signs. Clear. All the way. The feeling that this was a well-organized demonstration is becoming increasingly evident. I understand. They want us to complain. We will do that of what I understood on my fellow passengers. But it will also have an opposite effect, I will not fly with SAS again. Only if I absolutely have no other choice. And that means fewer and fewer customers for the company, and that means there may be no job complaining to SAS employees. Fredag den 20 juli 2018 modtog jeg kl. 19.20 en sms fra SAS om at flyet dagen efter vil være 2 timer forsinket. Afgangen oprindeligt skulle være fra Split kl. 10.10, 21 juli 2018. Mellemlanding i Stockholm, så videre til Oslo. Ankomst 14.35. Det viser sig selvfølgelig at costumer service ved SAS lukker kl. 19, og åbner ikke før 9 dagen efter. Split lufthavn er en af de værste i verden. Ingen tvivl. Jeg bliver lovet at hvis jeg vil, så skal jeg få baggage ud i Stockholm. Afgangen bliver flyttet til 12.15. Det er over 2 timer med ventetid uden siddepladser. Jeg sidder på gulvet i 2 timer. Flyet kommer. Ombord mødes vi af glade og fornøjede folk. Vi bliver informeret at forsinkelsen skyldes at crewet skulle have sin hvile. Der findes ingen stand by crew. For det er nu alle afvikler sine ferie. Det er flot. Vi lander, og jeg skynder mig for at finde transfer service center. Arlanda har desværre ingen skilte. Jeg har gået forkert to gange. Der er absolut ingen som har ventet på os eller givet os nogen information, det tager lang tid før vi forstå vi skal trække et nummer. Men hvad skal man trykke på? Damen i skranken er alene, og bliver rigtig sur over at vi trykker forkert. Jeg får et nyt boarding kort og besked om at jeg bliver nødt til at overnatte. Nu skal jeg gå ned i baggagehallen og snakke med costumer service der. Der findes ikke nogen costumer service der, bare baggage hjælp. Damen der giver mig alligevel et klistermærke med henvisning til hotellet - 3-retters middag siger hun. Jeg vil gerne have min baggage. Neeeej det kan jeg slet ikke få. Jeg bliver helt desperat. Ikke engang en tanbørste. Hun giver mig en pose. Det vil hjælpe. Nej, det vil det ikke, jeg skælder ud, hun siger bare Ja. Ja. Ja. Jeg kommer til hotellet, der får jeg at vide at middagen kan vi ikke få før 20.30. Hotellet har vigtigere gæster. Kl. er 16.00. Hvad er der i vejen med de her folk!! Der hører jeg i tillæg fra andre passagerer at de kunne få sin baggage ud uden problemer. Dagen efter kommer vi til Oslo. Jeg er 20 timer forsinket. Når vi går ud af flyet står der en venlig ung mand med skilt - transfer. De kan det vist nok i Oslo. Jeg lægger også mærke til skiltene. Tydelige. Hele vejen. Følelsen af at dette var en velorganiseret demonstration bliver mere og mere tydelig. Jeg forstår det godt. De vil have os til at klage. Det kommer vi til at gøre, af det jeg forstod på mine medpassagerer. Men det vil også have modsat virkning, jeg kommer ikke til at flyve med SAS igen. Kun hvis jeg absolut ikke har noget andet valg.

Minor complaints regarding the inability for families traveling with an infant to check in online and the terminal malfunctions in terminal 2 that where not really their fault, aside. The plane is comfortable, the route well planned out though very tight for any delays coming out of London and the seats very comfortable. The food is basic but good and the in-flight entertainment limited but sufficient for a single flight. I would love to leave the story here, unfortunately the experience fell apart following our arrival in Hong Kong. One of our baby car seats did not make either flight and was still in London. With no SAS representative in Hong Kong we were forced to deal with the baggage handler Jardine. When we asked how we are supposed to get home with no car seat the brisk reply was they don't know or care. Getting no where we proceeded onto the main desk to be told that the airline will not provide a spare car seat due to the potential liability if there was an accident the airline could be at fault. The solution provided was to hold our child in the car and take our chance. I am horrified to hear a representative of the airline suggest that the company cares more about possible liability than the safety of a child. This lack of any option forced us to take a very long and expensive train journey home with two very tired children at 8am on a Monday (otherwise known as rush hour). I understand that bags go missing (BA also lost a bag of ours on this same journey). however i expect the airline to take responsibility and provide a solution when you lose a safety device such as a car seat. To rub salt in the wound 4 days later we have still not received the car seat. Last we heard it missed the following days connecting flight to HK from arlanda and is currently still in Stockholm.

However the lounges at both Oslo and Stockholm are overcrowded, and the food selection is at the best average. Too many big tables, too few toilets as there was a line the whole time inside the lounge to go. The only good thing is enough power outlets.

The flight was one hour late - no explanation or apology for this. The next 4 hour flight to Faro started boarding 10 minutes before departure, and hence got a delay of 30 minutes - again no explanation. On board they had a few selections for the economy passengers to choose from to buy, but in «business» class the only option was salmon salad. Even though it is in the same square boxes. Why dont they let business class decide between rhe options themselves first, and then sell the rest to economy. To the coffee they served some chocolate in some nice boxes. However when we took one of them and bit in we noticed mould on it. The mould was hidden under a hard chocolate shell, so impossible to notice on the outside. We told the crew and got one more box and same here.

There was absolute chaos with them at Heathrow after they cancelled the flight to Copenhagen just one hour before it was due to depart (lack of crew and we actually saw the plane depart the airport with no passengers on!). Of course, this can happen with airlines but what was really the problem was the lack of knowledge and bad attitude of their staff ground and call centre staff. I received an SMS telling me the flight was cancelled and immediately went to the SAS transfer desk - a queue had already formed so I called the SAS call centre while waiting in the queue. To cut a long story short I had to make two phone calls and argue with three different SAS employees throughout the day in order to get onto a flight to Tokyo. SAS seems to have a very dysfunctional computer system and very little slack. In the end, I got onto an ANA flight 8 hours later. The return from Tokyo was late and I very nearly missed the connection back to London. And I am still waiting for my luggage to be returned 48 hours later! On board is OK - fairly basic food and no choice of food, but it was the chaotic scenes at Heathrow that would put me off flying with SAS again.

On three of the four segments water was served to every passenger who wanted some along with tea and coffee for no cost. Because SAS aspires to be a budget carrier they cater ALL flights with small bottles of water. However, flights less than 80 minutes are deemed too short to sell water at exorbitant prices so they serve it for free. The problem is they use many more plastic bottles than an airline would use if they had the normally-used big bottles. So much for SAS’ supposed concern for the environment, or for their passengers. Those who were served this “precious” water were given a ration of less than a small cup full and no refills.

I decided to do just that, left departure zone and went straight to the SAS / Star Alliance office to ask what was going on about my flight to Copenhagen. The woman behind the desk then told me the flight was delayed, but that was all she knew. What an impressing service. I then tried to call SAS in Copenhagen only to learn that SAS customer service have no information about current flight operations. However, travelling on SAS Plus, I anticipated that I would have access to the business lounge in Vilnius Airport. This turned out to be untrue. As the only carrier in Star Alliance, only SAS business customers are not entitled entry to the business lounge even if SAS sell their business tickets with the understanding that you can access the business lounges. Finally boarded the flight two hours and 15 minutes after planned departure and got my seat in row 3 in the extremely cramped CRJ900 aircraft. Food served was actually OK, only later to see that deserts were one month over expiry date! Bottom line is that I fly SAS around 28-30 times per year, and even if they leased out the Vilnius-Copenhagen route to Air Nostrum and CityJet, it still states SAS on the airline ticket. Fact is, that I have had 6 cancellations and 5 major delays the past 7 months. SAS used to be a quality airline, and had a world known brand for service and punctuality, but how times have changed. To me SAS is now no better than low-cost airlines, and the quality and punctuality is long gone in the race towards being cheap which SAS is not. Other airlines in the Star Alliance are way better than SAS. Even flying SAS Plus is like flying cattle class.

Although on the flight down to CPH had amazing cabin crew, the one to EWR was less impressive.  The IFE was good/decent. It will probably keep you entertained for a flight this long. The IFE offers some movies (around 58 if i remember correct) and some TV shows (Around 1-5 episodes for each one) That and the non-interactive route map. Although it might keep you entertained for just over the atlantic, maybe not a super long haul flight like from Scandinavia to LAX. SAS offers the In flight magazine and the menu digitally. Now this is a part with takes the IFE on this flight down. The games. There was only Chess under the ""Games"" category but there is some more under ""Kids"" and ""Games"" like tetris or something.  The food selection for the cold part was good but a little bit overpriced although I do like that you can pay with Eurobounus Points on SAS so if you are a frequent flyer with them you can pay around (I think it was) 1,100 Eurobounus points. Although the cold food was food hot food can get a little bit bigger in selection in my opinion. You get a free meal and breakfast/pre-landing meal for free. The free meal was 10/10 according to my tastes. The seat was good, The recline was decent as well as the comfort of the seat. The seat came with a pillow, blanket, water bottle and headphones.

338,H Dansten,Germany,2018-06-30,2,"Stuttgart to Reykjavik via Copenhagen. The flight between Stuttgart and Copenhagen and return was on a small jet as expected and of a duration of slightly more than an hour. No problems with either flight. The primary flight from Copenhagen to Iceland was the problem. - both outbound and the return. Having never flown SAS, I'd previously thought of them as a reasonably good national carrier. My assumption was mistaken. My experience with SAS ranks them as a cut-rate discount airline, but one that doesn't advertise themselves as such or acknowledge they are. I know what to expect if flying a discount airline so I'd have no rights to complain for lack of services/amenities, it would be expected - but this does NOT apply to SAS, nor their pricing!  The 3 hour flight on the A320 to Keflavik had zero entertainment options, closely spaced rows, very narrow seats, and no more than a few degrees of ""recline"" - so the word really doesn't apply to these seats. No-charge amenities equaled exactly coffee, tea, and water. On the return flight we asked for a second cup of water (was give a max. of 200 ml in the first cup), but were informed we were ""allowed"" one cup and we'd need to pay €3 if we wanted more. Outward flight: aircrew arrived at gate 23 minutes prior to scheduled departure. The broadcast delay was blamed on ""lots of baggage"" which is a bogus explanation; the passenger and bag information is a ""known"" well before the flight.  They were simply late and must think all passengers are mindless cattle. In the future if this airline's rates are competitive with other ""discount"" airlines, now that I know what to expect, I might use them again. But if that is not the case and unless hundreds of $ are saved per ticket we will never fly SAS again!

It has stayed in Stockholm. And, of course, no ground staff at the moment given to handle customer complaints either. Nor any shops open to at least buy myself an exchange underwear until tomorrow (I will now arrive to my destination only two days after I left).

About the lounge in review separately. The inconvenience here was that making the upgrade at the gate, I had to go back through passport control, walk some good steps and then go back through passport and security control to get back to the gate. I ended up 15 minutes in the lounge. And also, I had to ask them at the gate if I was able to use the lounge, they didn't tell me when I did the upgrade. Because it was new, I had to see it. The seat I got was indeed huge, although not as comfortable as expected. I was alone on the whole row and the cabin, even with so many upgrades was still empty.

Ever since that happened, there have never been so many delays and cancellations on this route, much to the irritation of frequent flyers like myself. This Friday was no exception. 5 minutes after boarding, the flight to Vilnius was cancelled, and all passengers were told to go to the Transfer Center in Copenhagen airport. I was then told I had been re-routed to Vilnius with AIr Baltic via Riga. I thought this was no big deal, however SAS refused me to get a Business Class seat with Air Baltic claiming ""the product you bought doesn't exist"". I then argued and asked how the product cannot exist when it clearly stated on my boarding card I was in business. I even provided the invoice stating my purchase in business. Bottom line is that SAS couldn't care less, and with their normal arrogant attitude I was sent onto Air Baltics old propeller machines in Economy Class, and eventually got to Vilnius with a 4 hour delay. All this is just not good enough. SAS has really turned into a low-cost airline, and at this time I have no confidence in this cheap airline. They sold me a product, and claimed it doesn't exist? Sorry, that is downright dumb. If SAS wants returning customers, they should really sharpen the pencil regarding customer service - in the airport as well as on board.

The fast-track access (available to Star Alliance gold and diamond members) is a very convenient and time saving benefit during the crowded afternoons. Boarding was taking place a bit late with the stressed cabin crew rushing and almost pushing everyone to take their assigned seat ASAP so we could depart on time. This kind of reception made you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome as a passenger. After all, it was not our fault that the boarding (and take-off) was behind schedule. The inflight menu is a bit limited and have very few options regarding warm meals/items but one things that annoys me a bit is the fact that all information on-board is printed in English only and not any of the Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish) as well. Although most Swedes and Scandinavians speak and understand good English there are always children and some senior citizens (like my grandparents) who don't speak, read, or understand it quite well wherefore bilingual information to all passengers would be a good idea. After all, this is supposed to be Scandinavian Airlines, not British Airways, United Airlines or that the airline carrier of any other English native speaking country. The positive thing is that the A320-neo is much more comfortable (and quieter) to travel in as a passenger than the aged B-737's that are slowly being phased out in SAS' current fleet.

I flew to Asia about once a year with Asia airlines and this is by far the worse experience for the following reasons. We picked this airline because it was the cheapest but for good reason because you have to pay for many things. The only seats that we can choose without fees during booking are the ones in the back of the plane. We can choose seats free within 24 hours. There is only one choice of food. You don’t get to chose. It is taking it or leave it.  No hand wipes before the meal. No free alcohol. I paid $8.64 for a tiny bottle of wine that I can buy for 2.50 Euros. For ANA, it is free.  No cabin service. I asked for a glass of orange juice. The flight attendant is in the back gallery. I went back there but the flight attendant was too busy talking to another passenger. I grab a Coke and she told me I have to pay for it. The seats were so cramped. We sat on row 35 which was just 2 rows in front of the 4 toilets and all we heard was vacuum going on when people flushed the toilets. The overhead light, you have to get up and push. No arm rest control.  Some passengers had to go through extensive thorough security screening. The flights were on time though and was even 30 minutes early on the leg from Stockholm to Los Angeles.

397,Una Celma,Latvia,2017-08-31,2,"✅ Verified Review   This is a review of a non-flight and lying by SAS on August 30 that led to me, my husband and our son losing a day of our travel to the New York area. We were to fly with SAS from Riga to Stockholm and then on with SAS to Newark. As we arrived to drop our baggage, it was clear that the SAS flight scheduled for 11.10 had been pushed back to 1200 and we would not make the connection. We asked what could be done and the ground staff in Riga said that SAS was working on re-booking us. Then the flight was pushed back to 13.00. My husband called SAS and they said that if we flew with the delayed flight, something would be rebooked for us in Stockholm, possibly on a different airline and that if we had to stay overnight, SAS would either provide accommodation or reimburse us. They said if they rebooked us to JFK and we submitted a taxi receipt for transport to Newark where we had a rental car waiting, they would reimburse the cost. After a while, the gate agent where the delayed flight was supposed to depart said that we would be rerouted with Air Baltic to Rekyavik and then on with Icelandair to Newark arriving at 19.00, a reasonable time. As some of the passangers started getting their new boarding passes, the gate agent said that my husband and our son and I would be routed from Riga to Rekyavik then to Minneapolis then to Newark arriving after midnight. As we have to drive about an hour to our hotel, this was unacceptable and we were rebooked to a United Airlines flight the next day. The gate agent, speaking for SAS, said that we would not be offered accommodation by SAS or reimbursement for such since we had declined to take their ""USA by night"" tour through Minneapolis. I think that this offer was, in fact, part of a lie by SAS, since they led us to believe we would get to Newark direct from Rekyavik and should not have been surprised that we declined.

399,J Fox,Ireland,2017-08-24,6,"✅ Verified Review   Dublin via Stockholm-Arlanda to Helsinki and return as it was a cheaper option by €70 than the direct route out of DUB. First sector was beset by problems and delays. Firstly, upon an inspection of the aircraft there was a technical issue with the emergency lighting and passengers waited almost 30 Minutes on a staircase before information was relayed to them and were requested to return and wait at the gate seating area. Secondly, after boarding the captain informed us that due to the earlier issue we'd missed our slot and that there would be ATC restrictions. He also added that there was a computer malfunction at Dublin Airport and we had to wait until this was resolved. Eventually, we departed at 13:30 (scheduled departure time of 11:50). This gave us an exceedingly tight transfer time at ARN for the flight to HEL. Originally, we should have had two hours to make the transfer; this being significantly reduced. However, upon approach to Stockholm after the captain had informed us we'd be landing in 10 minutes, I noticed this timeframe had elapsed and were now circulating over the airport and city for a time. It turned out that the airport was temporarily shut due to a drone in the area. We eventually landed at 17:00 - 1.5 hours behind schedule. Fortunately, due to the drone incident our Helsinki flight was delayed to 18:30 which gave us ample time to make the connection. All other flights were uneventful and flights on the return sector left and arrived on time. I've flown with SAS on 6 flights in the last year and have found their attendants and pilots to be professional, welcoming and competent but their aircraft worn, dated and tired. All four flights were on Boeing 737-600/700 series aircraft which were 17, 13, 19 & 15 years in the fleet. Time for modernisation. Their menu card is extremely limited in food choice and way over priced for what you get.

One benefit is supposed to be chosing your preferred seat when booking, but be prepared that they try to give you a another (worse) seat at the gate - happened to me on both legs. Food: a cold meal is included, OK quality when departing from Stockholm, worse on return leg. Drinks for free. Power outlet: should be available according to SAS website, but was not. At the airport Fast Track should be included - works brilliant in Stockholm but in Lisbon there was no sign of a fast track at all. Lounge access should be included - good lounge in Stockholm but in Lisbon there was no lounge at all admitting SAS Plus passengers. No information of the lack of fast track/lounge was given in advance. Check-in in advance: works fine in Stockholm, but not possible in Lisbon, only manual check in. (Separate SAS Plus check in counter, though.) Strange and confusing is that the booking is not possible to retrieve from the SAS App several hours before check in. What remains of the benefits of Plus is the possibility to rebook and cancel your ticket, more luggage and more eurobonus points.

412,Mia Susanna Krizo,United States,2017-07-04,1,"✅ Verified Review   Chicago to Stockholm. I flew to Stockholm from Chicago with my two children on July 02. At check-in we were given stand-by seats, and were told that we would be assigned seats at the gate, (which is something that has never happened in the 20+ years that I've flown with various airlines). I was concerned and asked if we would be seated together. The answer - ""I'm sure you will be."" We reached the gate and waited in another line (I wonder why SAS is stuck creating lines in the twenty-first century when there is no need for them) and were finally given our seats. I took a look at them, and noticed that one of my children was placed in another row. I asked to be seated next to both of my children, and was told that I had been given great seats, seats that I would normally have to have paid for. I said I didn't want better seats, I wanted to be seated next to my children. The person behind the desk said, ""I'll page you later."" He never did. On the plane I told the flight attendant that I really wanted and needed to be seated next to both of my children. Her answer - ""You have to pay extra if you want to be guaranteed a seat next to someone."" You read that right. In a SAS flight you have to pay extra to be seated next to your child. They appear to think it's acceptable for a child to spend 9 hours without being able to see or talk to his parent, a child who gets anxious during turbulence, and needs assistance with opening items during meals, and who wants to be close to his parent in an unfamiliar environment to feel safe. Luckily for us, a concerned passenger (who was appalled by the callous disregard of the flight attendant) switched seats with my son. Imagine that: a passenger has to do what the airline should have done without being asked. We provide the children's ages when booking the flight. The airline knows which passengers are children. This shouldn't be a problem. Another related problem was the quality of food. I was glad that I had packed food for my children, for it took the flight attendants nearly 2,5 hours to bring the evening meal and when it arrived, my children looked at the soggy, slimy vegetables and the overcooked meat and refused to eat it (so did I, btw). My advice to people is to think twice before booking a flight with SAS if they have children with them as nowhere do they mention that you have to pay to be seated next to your children, and as no sensible, feeling person would ever think that an airline would separate children from their parents it is something that parents can't prepare for. The eagerness of SAS to make money has reached a level of callousness that I believe is completely unmatched in the world of flying. As a native Swede, I find SAS to be an embarrassment and a disgrace. You can go after our money, but you can't go after our children to make that money.

413,I Pearson,United States,2017-07-04,7,"✅ Verified Review   Flew Chicago to Brussels via Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS did a solid job overall on this trip in both directions. The long-haul planes were clean and spacious, the short-haul ones, clean and cramped. Check in at O'Hare was fast and easy, check in at Brussels-Zaventem was chaotic. The crews were efficient and friendly (if not exactly engaged and charming, like those on, say, Aer Lingus). The seats were fine, and the entertainment system offered an interesting range of new and classic movies and shows. It was very nice to have some local offerings (subtitled). As for the food and beverages, they were so-so. There was only one meal option. And it did seem miserly and even a little embarrassing to offer only one complimentary non-alcoholic drink-and to repeat that fact several times over the intercom. Should we take up a collection to help the company stave off bankruptcy? Water, coffee, and tea were available free the entire flight, at least. All in all, SAS seems to be doing a halfway decent job of splitting the difference between its former higher-quality self and its cheapo, barbones Nordic rivals like WOW and Norwegian. I would definitely fly SAS economy to Copenhagen or Stockholm again if either were my final destination. I am not sure that I would do so on a connecting flight: the huge, slow lines facing transiting passengers for security and then again for immigration in both Copenhagen and Stockholm (jostling with masses of people for an hour just to *leave* the Schengen zone?) frustrated me to no end. If you are connecting through either of those airports, make sure that you have multiple hours (3+) in between your flights. Don't listen to the lucky people who landed when things were calm and breezed through the obstacle course. You never know how many flights will have landed the same time as yours.

However, the problem was the aircraft! One of the reasons I chose SAS was their new upgraded cabin in economy (wifi etc.), but the first aircraft from CPH-EWR was their spare aircraft because of technical difficulties on the original. It is annoying, but I would prefer to fly a plane that works even though having to give up on comfort. But one week after, on the return flight, I was once again (within one week) put on another spare aircraft. This seems very suspicious and completely unacceptable. For an 8-hour flight in a worn-down, old and grubby plane, this is far from the initial reason in choosing SAS. We did get Ipads, which was great, but it lacked the inflight information etc. that I love watching. I will use SAS on european flights, but I would not use them again on long-haul economy class. Lufthansa is much much better, but their timetable did not fit mine for this flight. I also find it frustrating, that you have to pay for beverages outside of meal service.

It turned out that the flight was operated by Air Nostrum. Before take-off, no safety instructions were given by the attendants. It was a recorded safety instruction in English language only. This is a Scandinavian airline, and while many people do understand English, some do not - especially elderly passengers. In my opinion it's just not good enough only to announce safety instructions in English only, well knowing that some passengers may not understand. After this, the cabin purser came on the PA with her introduction about the services provided through the flight, but in such bad English that I didn't understand anything they were talking about. Before take-off, none of the cabin staff checked through the aircraft if passengers had their seatbelts on. Before landing this was repeated. No attention was made to whether passengers had fastened seatbelts and/or put trays up. Bottom line in my opinion is that this airline simply don't care about safety. While this airline operates on behalf of SAS, they should begin taking safety seriously, and their cabin attendants just need to be able to talk better English.

The gate staff were particularly bad, holding up the line multiple times at Helsinki to deal with travellers whose bags had not scanned properly at self check-in (there was a second staff who just stood around). One thing they don't do like other budget airlines is enforce cabin baggage limits - I saw people getting on with 2 or 3 decent sized bags and the compartments filled up quickly, leading to arguments between late passengers and the disinterested staff. However, the price didn't seem as cheap as a budget airline should be.

433,L Tang,Hong Kong,2017-03-23,1,"✅ Verified Review   Hong Kong to Stockholm return. We flew SAS for 7 legs in March. Generally, the inland flights and short international flights (ARN-OSL) are fine. But Hong Kong to Stockholm was delayed for 3.5 hours, so that all connecting flights are re-routed and still we barely made it. The baggage didn't make it and was delayed for 16 hours. When we checked with ground staff in Tromso, they seemed to know nothing regarding the whereabouts of our baggage. They said we can wait 2 hours for the next flight and we did. Our baggage was not on the carousel and we checked with them again. Then after some walking around they said it will be on the plane the next day morning, but the delivery people won't pick it up before 4:30 pm the next day and we were given the choice of coming back to pick it up at our own cost. We ended up getting our baggage sent to our hotel at 6 pm. First off, the ground staff should allow more transfer time when re-routing our connecting flights. Second, I can't see, in this age how those people at Tromso not know where our baggage is and when it will arrive. Then on the inbound flight SK963 ARN-HKG, the captain said the cargo cabin door was broken after boarding is completed. Then for 3 hours, we were stuck on the plane with no food provided and no heat. Every 30 minutes, the captain updated with something like the technicians were still checking and he had no further info. At last, the damage needed to be fixed by someone from Airbus HQ in Toulouse and SAS is not attempting to switch us to another aircraft or re-route us at all. The flight was delayed for 24 hours. And if you have anything important to do, too bad, because you shouldn't have chosen SAS at all. The funny thing is, even though the flight was delayed for 24 hours, we still had to wait for them to load the containers after all passengers were boarded. About 30 minutes after the flight's scheduled time, the captain made an announcement again, saying the containers were loaded in the wrong order and had to be re-loaded again. All in all, SAS sounds like a joke. On SK963 and SK964, only 1 non-alcoholic drink is provided for free throughout the 10-hour flight. On shorter flights, only coffee, tea or water is provided for free. You may want to stock up on snacks before boarding.

I have NEVER had an experience in ANY airport like I did today. Because I am flying from Stockholm, via Zurich (staying overnight) and into Washington DC, I was not able to check in on-line. I knew I needed to see a counter agent before I even got to the airport. I followed the signs to the correct check-in and presented my confirmation and Star Alliance gold card to the SAS agent who was at a mobile counter outside of the lines to see an agent. He immediately and very rudely told me I had to check in at the kiosks. I tried to tell him that I wouldn't be able to check in at the kiosks, but he was uninterested in my response and told me, ""that's what we do here."" Sure enough, I was not able to check in at the kiosk and went back asking to see his supervisor. He kept saying that he was a supervisor. In the meantime, I was so flustered, I thought I had lost my passport. I told him I wanted to speak to someone who was his supervisor or boss, but the person I finally talked to said he was at the same level as the person with whom I had the problems. The second supervisor I spoke with was someone nicer, but never apologized for the way in which I was treated.

Although obviously new, small, crowded, lacking facilities and minimal food and drinks offerings. On to the flight, seating just 4 across in business and only 8 rows so an exclusive feel. New interior, seats look similar to Emirates business but comfort nowhere near as good, neither supporting head or lower back - noticed many other passengers all trying to get comfortable using pillows etc just as I did. Once into flat bed it was decent. Big TV screen but minimal content. Wifi worked reasonably well for a plane. Food was excellent though as were the crew.

Had the connection in Copenhagen. At the boarding line the SAS staff who checked my passport (Romanian/EU passport) stopped me and said that she has to check if I need a visa to travel further. At first I was amused and asked her ""really, Romania is in EU!"" as I though it was a joke! But very annoyed with my answer, she said that she has to check (even though on my passport was written EU, and Romania - in EU since 2007!). I didn't feel it is worth continue an argument with such an ignorant person. This situation created big discomfort. I don't know if the airport/airline employees have to give a general knowledge test (common sense would be enough), but so much ignorance is unacceptable.

Due to the really slow luggage delivery of SAS I had to go to a local shop in Övik and buy some toilet consumables and underwear. SAS rules say that in this kind of cases they pay the costs of buying the supplies. I tried to send a report to SAS Customer Care with a copy of a document I got from Övik airport. I was responded that SAS is not able to process my request because they do not have access to their sub-contractors system to check the report of my luggage.

However, once in Copenhagen, we had to run around by ourselves to find where our connecting flight was, and we only had these 15 minutes to do it, so we were basically given up after being reassured all the way back in the first airport. Oh well. Flew a propeller aircraft for the first 30 minutes flight, had leather seats. Were comfy but would probably end up giving backache if the flight was longer. Next flight was a bigger plane with more room. Seats weren't the same leather one but regular. Free coffee and tea served during the whole flight.

SAS delivered the flight, but it is operated by FlyBe through wet-lease. The cabin was clean, but as always with this type of aircraft (ATR-72), the space is a bit small. The cabin crew was 2 flight attendants, who had a lot to do during the short haul. They were nice and professional, but busy doing all service within less than an hour. The flight was quite on time leaving Stockholm and arriving in Kalmar with only 10 minutes delay due to some kind of a passenger issue. Take off and landing was done smoothly. The small ""dish"" served onboard was salmon paté with dark bread. They served snacks and drinks, including beer/wine at request for the SAS Plus (premium economy) passengers. All passengers in SAS Go (economy) was served coffee/tea, but had to buy other food or Beverages. My evaluation is based on the case, that this is a short domestic flight of less than an hour.

Again, the SAS flight was operated by FlyBe (wet lease). The flight attendants were professional, efficient and polite. The flight was easy, nice and hassle free, which followed the scheduled time. The only hitch was not on the flight or the personnel, because it was due to some kind of weather. I experienced some turbulence before the landing. The pilots managed the weather with some gusts with great experience, so I felt very safe. The type of aircraft is a bit odd since the only door to board it is placed in the rear end. I evaluate the haul as it is since it is a very short domestic haul of less than an hour. The food and beverages for SAS Plus this time was thin bread rolls with cheese or turkey.

485,D Johnson,United Kingdom,2016-08-08,8,"✅ Verified Review   Oslo to Edinburgh booked in SAS Plus, or premier economy. Perhaps it is worth noting that SAS do not offer or sell Business class on Nordic, or international European flights. This was an early morning departure after a night-stop in OSL from an earlier TOS/OSL flight. Check-in was done using a machine the evening before. This was fine. Having no hold baggage there was no contact with SAS ground staff. The Fast Track security is offered as part of the SAS Plus deal. This eased the way through a very busy OSL departures area on a summer Monday morning. The flight departed from the F gates. To access the F gates you need to pass though the E gates and Passport Control. Travellers in SAS Plus have access to the SAS Lounge. Unfortunately there is no Lounge at the F gates and having gone though Passport Control there was no right of return to the Lounge in the E gates area. Boarding appeared efficient, announcements were made in Norwegian followed by English. SAS Plus offered 9 seats in total at the front of the B737-600. All other seating was for SAS Go. There is no seat difference at all except the bulkhead row did offer more leg room, this based on experience from an earlier flight in SAS Go. After an on time departure a light continental breakfast was served. Heated bread rolls, yogurt, a very small packet of muesli, juice and the usual coffee and tea. The tea/coffee cups used are really too small and flimsy. The Flight Attendants did however offer refills as they passed through the cabin. The aircraft arrival at the gate in EDI was 5 minutes ahead of schedule. That said the process for leaving the plane was subject to about a 10 minute delay cased by the lack of ground staff. SAS appear to contract Swissport as their EDI agents. From observation and the experience, there was not enough staff in attendance. I would recommend SAS for future travel, perhaps SAS Plus is not worth the extra money for such a short flight? Minor issues were the lack of staff representing SAS at EDI, and better signage at OSL for Lounge locations.",Boeing 737-600,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,OSL to EDI,August 2016,3.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0,,3,yes,False,OSL,EDI,

488,M Churchill,United States,2016-07-26,4,"✅ Verified Review   Split, Croatia to Washington, DC via Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark. SAS Arrival Services in Stockholm gave me the rudest treatment I've ever received by an airline. The flights were not bad, but the customer service experience in Stockholm was bad enough to make me think twice before flying this airline again. I did not know where to go when I arrived in Stockholm. I had a layover there overnight, and the signs were very confusing. I went to Arrival Services for help. When I got there, two people were receiving help at the counter, so I took the next number and stepped back to wait in line. As I waited, a large group of unhappy passengers missing baggage started to show up there, except they ignored the numbers and the line and went straight to the counter. I was upset, but I figured that the customer service folks would ask them to wait. Rather than tell them to take a number, however, they simply started serving the rude passengers. Trying to be polite, I waited, and waited and waited. After about 30 minutes had passed and roughly 30 other passengers had walked around me, I decided to be more assertive and approach the representative directly, who had stepped out from behind the counter. When she finished with her previous passenger, I looked her right in the eye and said hello, and started to ask for help. At that moment, another passenger (presumably Swedish, from the way she spoke) stepped around me and started speaking to the same representative. The rep turned to her and started helping her instead. Finally fed up, I interrupted them and asked for help. I stated that I had been next in line for 30 minutes, and I just had a simple question to ask. She said ""I'm working right now"", in a tone that indicated I was not worthy of her assistance. Not sure what I had done wrong (other than wait in the line they had askede to wait in), I interrupted again. I said ""My problem is simple, I don't have any lost baggage"". She replied ""I am speaking to this person right now"", indicating the girl that had stepped in front of me. Now completely annoyed for having been repeatedly ignored, I said ""she just stepped right in front of me!"", to which I received the response of a disgusted sigh and a dismissive wave of the hand. She turned away and helped the order passenger. I was floored by the rudeness. I walked away for 15 minutes, and came back. The other passengers were now gone. I walked directly to her and asked if it was finally a good time to offer me some help. She smiled at me as if we'd never met before, no apology, but it was one of those smiles that indicated she was really just hoping I would leave. Although she did finally answer my question, I left there feeling like I must have really done something wrong to earn that kind of treatment. Maybe it was just that I wasn't Swedish. Everything else was okay. Flights were fine, food was fine. Inflight staff were moderately polite, but not incredibly warm.

When I booked there was no warning about having to book bags additionally. Nothing seemed to indicate that they have the same system as Easyjet or similar where you know you have to add bags additional. At the airport I find out, and I am charged $75 for one bag check-in. This is rip-off. SAS is represented in Geneva through another ground service company, and they tried to reach someone from SAS but for 30 minutes it was not possible to get through to any representative. I rarely use SAS, but on earlier flights every single time they found something that cost me considerable extra money regarding luggage.  Companies like Easyjet you know they will go for it at the airport and you prepare. Now I know SAS is worse than Easyjet, and I will never use them again. Seems cheap and by the time you have checked in it is more expensive than flying Lufthansa.

The seat could be made into a fully lie flat bed which was incredibly welcome as I have a hard time sleeping on normal flights. It also featured a massage function, which was nice. About two hours before we landed, we were offered breakfast, which was really good. There was a large assortment of included wares and although I did not really ask for much, it was still nice to see. My only real complaint is that I failed to connect to the wifi, even after numerous tries. But I had no pressing need for it and there was much else to do instead. All in all, it was definately the most comfortable flight I have had, complimented with a very friendly and professional staff.

In Kiruna my bag arrived after most people had collected their bag. There was no food served. I got a smoothie and a can of mineral water. The passenger next to me got some wine and a small bag of crisps. Flying SAS these days feels more like flying Ryanair. The service at the airport and onboard is terrible.

On the return flight NRT-CPH, the flight was delayed 2hrs, SAS handled it well with food coupons and keeping connecting passengers informed.

On a full flight, a flight attendant could make things a little easier for the passenger on an already uncomfortable flight, it doesn't take much. Not on this flight, one service with ""what do you want"" and tray thrown onto table, then nothing. Good service in form of flight deck announcements. One year old aircraft and signs of dirt. SK718 crew were better, though again old aircraft, narrow seat, not much legroom on first row. I think SAS have downgraded their service by selling out their former subsidiary Blue1 B717 aircraft and switched to old and cramped B736 to and from Finland.

The male staff member spoke to a passenger near us, regarding where to put a bag, with total contempt. I have never heard such a rude purser. On the 2 hour flight to Dublin, we were served 1 drink of coffee and that was it. The seating is cattle class, very tight and uncomfortable. They allowed a clearly drunk passenger to shout and swear at his friends across the isle, which offended most of the plane. This tirade went on until we landed. The stewardesses just smiled at them and thought it was all very funny. During the booking process, cancellation insurance was added, which was not wanted, nor ordered. I immediately emailed the airline, but heard nothing from them for 3 days. When I did hear from them, the email told me to call Customer Services. CS had me on hold for 40 minutes and then refused to do anything, as I should have notified them straight away that I did not require the insurance. I explained that I had informed the airline immediately, via the email SAS provided for such complaints. They then gave me a phone number of the insurer. I called it, this was incorrect. The number SAS gave me was for an old insurance company, who had not provided their insurance for over 8 months.

I was there for a conference and they told me to go to a store and buy what I needed and the airline would reimburse me. After buying one suit and 2 shirts to get me through my conference, the airline emailed me and said there was a limit on reimbursement (which was never communicated). They were only giving me back about 25% of what I spent. When I tried to talk with someone the customer service people said I can only submit complaints via email and I cannot talk to anyone. The customer service of SAS airlines is the worst I have ever seen. I will never fly them again. This airline will not stand behind their claims and will not reply to customers.

578,Kate Chu,United States,2015-09-15,5,"This is a review for SAS flight from Chicago to Copenhagen. I checked in online and was able to switch my seat from the assigned one to window seat toward the front. However, SAS online check-in system was funny and did not send me any confirmation email nor the boarding pass, therefore I had to confirm this in person at ORD. The staff at the check-in counters were very helpful and accmmodated all my requests without any  annoyance. Boarding went smoothly. Initially the cabin temperature was very hot but was adjusted to the more comfortable level quickly. We departed about 30 minutes behind schedule but arrived at CPH 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Taxiing to the gate at CPH was very short and very quickly passengers were allowed to deplane. In-flight services : the seat was comfortable with ample leg room, despite an old cabin. FA's were all very friendly, but the food was terrible. The worst part of this trip was that about 30% of the IFE (mine included) were completely out of order. Fortunately it was a red-eye flight and I was able to get away with sleeping. However, this was a huge drawback and I would've given this flight a score of 8 or 9 had the IFE been working.",A340-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Copenhagen,September 2015,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,,4,yes,False,Chicago,Copenhagen,

Meals were excellent, and they had something for every taste. A buffet of coffee, beer, juice and soda as well as fruit, pastry and other snacks was open during most of the flight.

I filed a complaint with their Customer Care department as was just told it will take at least 8 weeks for them to address it. I had a 90 minute layover in Oslo, and yet my bags still did not make the connection to Heathrow. I was travelling with my 6-month old son, but without my wife, and I had all of my son's food and clothes in the bag that missed the connection. I had to catch a flight the next morning on another airline (Air Berlin) and my bags did not arrive in time, so I had to miss the flight to wait for my baby's food. Upon arriving in Heathrow I was told my bags would arrive that evening. Then I was told they would arrive early in the morning. They showed up later that evening. So I waited for my bags which is why I missed my flight. The SAS representative at Heathrow was very helpful and she spoke with someone at British Airways who operated the flight by Air Berlin, who said that they cancelled my ticket and I would not be penalized on a new flight, but when I spoke to British Airways and Air Berlin later that evening after my bags showed up to reschedule my flight, they had no record of the conversation and recorded me as a ""no-show"" which means that somebody messed up.  As a result, I had to buy a new flight. My bags eventually showed up the following evening.  I was travelling with a baby who was stuck without his usual food.

Priority boarding for both SAS/Star Alliance diamond and gold members and SAS Plus passengers. Welcoming and smiling crew at front door, clean cabin and comfortable economy seat. Overall service was very good, both purser and flight attendant took good care of us frequently serving drinks and snacks which are included. Crew was friendly and talked with every passenger in Plus. Cockpit crew announcements during flight were prompt and informative. Flights were on time. This is the way flying should be.

SAS charge you like a full-service carrier but offer low cost service. To me there is really no difference between SAS and Ryanair appart from the fact that SAS let's you check a bag for ""free"". Water, snacks, beverages (except coffee and tea) are priced rather heavily . Would advise anyone to buy it at the airport and bring it onboard. Flight attendants pleasant from GOT-NCE. On the return flight the crew consisted of the typical disinterested older ladies, one of which was downright rude. They hid in the galley for most of the trip. Seats were comfortable for a 2,5 hrs flight and the online check-in with mobile boaring passes worked really well. Both flights arrived on time. Due to previous experiences with SAS, I haven't flown them for quite some time. And I won't be for the near future either. Spend your money elsewhere.

There was a mild apology given by the captain but not any discounts nor free drinks on the flight. Our plane seemed dated but was clean. Individual entertainment systems on the back of each seat are the worst I’ve experienced. Only a third of the published opportunities worked and the movies are on a loop with no pause nor start. Audio was terrible. Food quality was far less than average. The flight was smooth and we arrived at our destination safely. Return: Pre-flight online check-in was easier for our group. At the Copenhagen terminal once inside, it was not easy to understand what line to enter to begin your process as their signage could be improved. Boarding was efficient and on time. This plane appeared to be even older than the first one. I believe it was an Airbus A340? Entertainment systems and screen illumination were even worse than our first flight! Food was awful.
