0,Marc Schmidt,United States,2023-11-13,1,"SAS is by far the most hideous, cynical and humiliating airline out there.  It summarizes the idea of making the economy experience as miserable as possible, so next time you're willing to pay all kinds of upgrades. A humiliating concept with the goal to squeeze as much money as possible out of every flight to shovel a few more pennies to their shareholders. . Legroom is non existent. On an 11 hours transatlantic flight your knees are jammed between your's and the front seat. Except one tiny free drink with what they call meal (of course only non-alcoholic), they hold a credit-card terminal under your nose, even for a miniature-can of coke. Attached photo of the atrocity called ""dinner"" condenses their cynicism in a says-it-all image. Of course the luggage got lost and exactly no-one at SAS felt compelled to help relocating it. ""Not our problem."" It was delivered 4 days after our arrival. It comes with no surprise that up to now it is impossible to reach anyone for the modest compensation of $150 to bridge those 4 messed up vacation days with fresh underwear and a few care products for 2 people. This airline is an absolute disgrace.

1,D Garsen,United Kingdom,2023-11-12,2,Where to start Check in was good There is no use of a lounge in Manchester Flight was 2.50 late Everyone's Luggage was off loaded at Manchester due to a fault in the hold. Customer services in Stockholm just handed us a card to do the delayed luggage ourselves  No ownership  The only person who showed any concern was baggage manager. I emailed Customer services who just gave a standard answer and CEO who has not replied. The Customer services director who I spoke to by tel was utterly disinterested I did get my bag 24 hours later SAS have not even had the courtesy of replying to me. On a positive the crew were friendly and efficient This is simply the worst customer service I have ever received from an airline I guess they will read this and shrug their shoulders I will be astonished if they reach out but I live in hope.

2,Kathleen Paolini-Kennington,United States,2023-10-23,1,"Never check a bag onto a SAS flight, unless you have the means to replace all of it. I flew SAS from Rome to London. I landed in Heathrow with the clothes on my back, after they left my baggage behind at the layover city, and I had another 7 weeks of travel ahead of me. Everything I had in that bag was basically new, some still with tags. Even the suitcase was new. They literally gaslight you, having you fill out spreadsheets, down to the color, brand, cost, place of purchase of socks. They said they need that in order to ""identify"" my luggage. Then, they have you do it again for the claim. Then, 3 months later, they gave me 400, which basically covered the suitcase. They never even refunded the baggage fee.

3,Kirstie Burndred,United Kingdom,2023-10-06,1,I recently booked flights with SAS and received an email to say my flight had changed. When on the ‘my booking’ section there were no suitable options so I was left with no other choice but to cancel my flight. I was then only refunded 10% of the flight as after cancelling only at this point was I advised that the flight was only moved by 5 minutes but I was advised that the flight had moved by a day. I then asked for the flight to be uncanceled and I was advised ‘it’s your fault your problem you must pay’.

4,F Bauer,Germany,2023-10-04,1,"I took a flight from Paris to Larnaca via Oslo. As I arrived in Cyprus my suitcase did not. After waiting for the woman for one hour who was responsible for this flight company SAS, I got a phone number of the person who is in charge for giving an update for lost items (during all this time we had a car booked from car sharing - so we needed to spend money during this time). At no time of a day somebody was answering the phone. A week later I needed to take a car from the car sharing to go to the airport to finally receive some information but they had still no idea. For 13 days there were no news, no location of the suitcase, no hint that it is not stolen. A hell for me because there were things inside with high value for me. The first time I knew that it is still existing was because of a personal call from Oslo that they will send my suitcase to Cyprus. This call just happened because my number was on a sign on the suitcase. In general, I had to wait 15 days until my suitcase was arriving. In the end SAS takes no costs at all. Neither they care about the extra stuff I needed to buy (cosmetics, bikini) nor the uncomfortable feeling I had nor they pay the extra costs I had because of the car sharing to fight for information they owed me. All that because I paid for a flight with a good service. Is it not a little bit ironic? The service is for a flight company which is defining itself not to be part of a cheap one, is really bad. I gave money to SAS for not doing their job correctly, losing my suitcase and not being a help at all. They do not even try to be sorry. Whenever it is possible, it is better to avoid SAS!

8,Edris Salih,Canada,2023-09-02,2,"SAS airline has the worst customer service. I did travel on the middle of May of this year. Few very bad things happened with me and I explained this in my case which I attached in a file and I sent to SAS. Here I am just mention about my luggage is delayed for one day and since that day I was contacting them until I got back to Canada. I did register with their customer service that my luggage is delayed and they record everything and they gave me the paper to prove that and I sent this paper to SAS. I asked the customer service to deliver my luggage to the address that I have, she told me call this number and when your luggage is arrived this evening will let you know. However, I could not stay in airport and I went to my visits place without my luggage. All afternoon and night of that day I tried hundred time to contact them but no one was answered me. Therefore, I came back to Schiphol airport for tomorrow to getting back my luggage. After two hours of investigation I could get my luggage is back and again they gave a paper of that delay and I sent this paper to SAS too. When I got back to Canada, end of May, I sent email to them with all my documents and I explained in detail what happened to me. After one month a person from customer service answered me. He asked me to send them something called (PIR) number and also my bank info to send me back what I spent because of this issue. I told them these are all paper that I have from my travel. After several weeks they sent me another email and they told me this is your clime number. There was no update and I sent another email and again they asked me about PIR number. I told them I do not know what is this but you have all my information and the specific papers of delaying is luggage. However, we exchanged around 12 emails and I have all of them. Last month I sent back another email about is there any new update. Few days ago they sent me an email and told me that your file will be closed because I had to claimed my luggage during 21 days.

9,Raynold Aquino,Canada,2023-08-27,3,"On 18 July we received an email notification about Delay Information as follows: “Flight SK0944 Chicago ORD - Copenhagen CPH 19 Jul, with scheduled time of departure 22:00 is delayed to 11:15, 20 Jul”. No reasons/explanations were provided for the cause of delay. Airline carriers must first inform passengers of the reason in plain language, regardless of whether the situation is in their control or not. The new departure date on July 20 scheduled at 11:15 was further delayed to 12:54 PM CET, arriving 03:31AM CEST, (+1). This causes delayed arrival on final flight destination of more than 14 Hours from the original ticket (contract of carriage) thereby eligible for delayed flight compensation of CAD$1,000 per person x 2. (Per SAS tariffs Rules 85, Schedules D (O) and EU Reg. No 261/2004 Art. 6 (1)(a)(i)(ii)(iii). 2. On 19 July around 7:30PM, at the check-in counter at SAS in Chicago ORD, front desk’s staff confirmed the flight delays but declined to provide specific details/reasons when asked multiple times. Also, no alternative options were offered for another similar flight to reach final destination. However, the front desk’s staff were very patient and helpful in finding us hotel accommodation (to stay for the night 19 July) including meals and transportation to and from the airport per SAS tariff No. 376 (O) Rule 85 Schedule D page 86 & EU Reg 261 Article 9 (1)(a)(b)(c). On 15 August, we filed a request for delayed flight compensation on SAS online form. It was denied the next day 16 August thru email emphasizing that allegedly “BIRDSTRIKE” was the caused of delays which was not mentioned on SAS 18 July delay information email. The airline has to prove this by providing extracts from logbook or incident reports. The air carrier (SAS) should give this evidence to the relevant national enforcement body as well as to the PASSENGERS concerned in line with the national provisions on access to documents. Per phone conversation with SAS customer representative, she verified the cause on record as “BIRDSTRIKE” according to SAS database. She decline to provide further details and flatly turn down request for documents for the alleged incident. Flight Delay Certificate confirmed the flight irregularity but didn’t specify the alleged occurrence of BIRDSTRIKE incident. 3. In contrast to what the front desk staff said when asked about the cause of scheduled flight delays: “It was not delayed. It got cancelled. It has to be called delay only because there’s 2 flights today that have the same flight”.(Conversation audio recorded, 20 July) (FlightAware) 4. Indeed there’s 2 flights scheduled to depart ORD on 20 July (Doc. 4). Called SAS customer service on 17 August (Conversation was audio recorded) to verify the flight information based on our Booking Reference Number. She stressed out that per SAS database, our scheduled flight departed on 19 July Chicago ORD 22:00PM and arrived Copenhagen CPH on 20 July 13:20PM. 5.

We therefore had to get a taxi to the airport to arrive in time.

17,N Stainer,Canada,2023-07-26,1,"This is the first time I'm travelling since Covid, going to my home country to visit family & friends, only the second time in 13 years I'm making this trip. What a horrible experience! Starting in Ottawa. Not fun at all going through the US customs control where I was treated like I was a criminal, just because their system didn't take my fingerprints. The leg from Ottawa to Newark was fairly ok, however, the leg from Newark to Copenhagen was horrible, even though I spent a lot of money in an online auction to upgrade my seat to premium. As a vegetarian, I pre-ordered with both my agent and the airline vegetarian food long before my trip started. I didn't get any food at all and had to sit and smell horrible meals for hours. I received nothing during all those hours on the plane, in my premium seat. I thought I was treating myself to something nice, but it was a waste of money instead. The inflight crew was also quite bad. Not once did they come over to ask if I wanted or needed anything, although I was in the premium section. One of them was chatting away with the person in front of me, not at all paying attention to the other travellers in the cabin. It was annoying. Then, during my first week in Norway, the airline cancelled my return ticket, without any chance to get me another return. After hours spent on the phone (my phone bill was $50 more expensive than normal) and chatting with various agents, who of course could not help me, I was supposed to get refunded for the cancelled return - which wasn't even half the amount of my full ticket price. This had to be cleared with the airline, I was told by the agent. It's been two months and I still haven't seen a dime. I have also spent hours online, during my much-needed vacation on the cost of being with my family, trying to find a new return ticket, just to find out that a one-way ticket is three times more expensive than the price of a roundtrip ticket. I called the airline, telling them to fix me a return ticket, which they of course could not at all do! Even though they were the ones cancelling my return, they could and would not help me. So, here I am sitting day after day looking for cheap flights back home to Canada. This trip will be horribly expensive in the end, thanks to the airline, which clearly does not know what customer service is. I am left all alone to fix myself. My trip was supposed to be three months, and I can only imagine if I had stayed for only a couple of weeks. It's been a complete nightmare and I will never ever use this airline again. I'd rather spend a little more money going with someone else, and I check reviews on all of them now. I still do not have a return ticket or received a refund. I'm royally angry and cannot express how dissatisfied I am.

29,Ethan Oppenlander,United States,2023-06-15,1,"This was the absolute worst flying experience of my life. I have flown to and from Europe several times, generally sticking to Lufthansa but this time I chose to fly SAS. SAS cancelled one of our flights 2 weeks before leaving, they offered only one choice for replacement, which required a 16 hour layover in Chicago. I chose to accept it since rescheduling would have been very expensive and my wife was 7 months pregnant. The flight had 2 stops and due to the continuous changing of our tickets our layovers were changed to 45 minutes (originally 3 hours). This caused my wife and I to miss a connecting flight to Amsterdam, SAS offered a replacement flight which had another stop in Oslo, along with another 10 hours of combined layover. They offered a 10$ coupon so we could eat in the airport, which covers basically nothing, which didn't even work in the end. That wasn't all though, on the return flight one of our return tickets was canceled 3 days before returning. After several phone calls we got this resolved. A day before leaving we checked our flight information in the app and our tickets disappeared again. after several more hours of stress and fighting to get home we managed to get our tickets resolved along with another 10+ hours of layover.

30,P Hayne,Norway,2023-06-14,2,"SAS customer service needs major improvement. For starters, I’ve spoke to 4 different representative and out of 4, 3 didnt wanted to help. They simply serve the information without any further suggestions to what can be done and bounce it onto someone else. At the airport, the representative denied me boarding and told me to call SAS phone number to get rebooked which was within my right and also on the ticket that I bought. I don’t disagree with him but his attitude was rather dismissive. He did at least confirm that he put a note on my profile for rebooking. It took over 2 hours on hold. At which point, the “rebook before 1 hour” option was no longer available. The agent at least tried to rebook and could not. I asked if she saw the note the airport representative put, for some reason, the last note was not there. I asked if she would make a note. She confirmed she did. The recommendation was to book a flight and then file a complaint to say I’ve waited for 2 hours on the phone and if it was done immediately, it would of been fine. I tried to look into options. At this point in time, the ticket was a blowing mind of over 31000 nok! Not happening, can’t afford this. I called them again and after over 2 hours on hold, decided for the next day. The next day, I managed to get someone on chat. I asked to see if there was any recommendations because I can only see prices that are quite unreasonable. She said, “prices are as is on the website”. The next question was, can you please confirm if you see the notes made by your other two colleagues which she did not respond. I then ask about how the filing of complaint work, which she simply said (along the lines of), “they’ll look into it”. The next question was, “how long will it take?” The response was, something along the lines of longer than 2 weeks but we’re not committing to any time. All the responses were quite dismissive. For starter, the first and last agent didn’t really try to help but rather just tried to shrug me off. I understand there might of not been much they can do, but the experience and the way the responses were handle was right out of the book or just dismissive of help. Also, where are all the notes that people can’t confirm they’re seeing from past conversations? Not please with waiting over 2 hours on calls on two occasions and customer services and SAS members answering from a book with no attention to services or customer satisfaction.

46,E Meares,Sweden,2023-04-29,1,"SAS (Scandinavian Airlines) has the worst customer service, by far, of any carrier I have the displeasure to experience. They also seem to have complete disrespect for their customers and the laws protecting their customers. During covid SAS cancelled my flight and refused to refund my ticket (which was not their choice - this was a case of following the law). I threatened legal action and reported them to ARN (Swedish government body for consumer affairs) then I received my refund within the hour. This week I tried to rebook a flight and SAS claimed they needed to charge an additional fee (on top of the rebooking fee) for a flight that was half the price. Their excuse was simply that on their system the flight I wanted to change to was more than twice that advertised on the website. When I asked for them to explain this difference they put me on hold for 10 minutes, then hung up. Inexcusable behavior that I have also reported this to ARN.

I had to call customer service four times before I was finally able to be helped and find a new flight and their reasoning for changing the flight was that “flights from Chicago to Stockholm were cancelled for that week” when I was no trying to go to Stockholm at all. After all that I did make it to Dublin but then on my way home I had a layover in Denmark but my flight was changed from my travelmates also without our knowledge and I did not find out until I got to the airport with my boarding pass. I waited for a few hours until the customer service desk opened and thought they would be able to switch me to the same flight as my friends but they said they couldn’t because that would mess with the checked luggage even though I was only traveling with a carry on.

52,C Heales,United States,2023-03-18,1,"My daughter & I just flew last night from San Francisco to Copenhagen. What a horrible experience, even before we left the house! I am a Premier Gold Star Alliance member & was told when I called into SAS customer service that I could check in 30 hours before departure. I tried to purchase seats 48 hours before & was locked out ! When I called again I had a very rude woman tell me ""sorry, the computer is locked & you have to check in at the airport"". I explained I had called in & had been told something different to which she responded, ""I don't know about that, but it's locked now & you have to check in at the airport"". I tried again at 30 hours & again was locked out. I called again & received the same terrible service. I was finally able to check in & get seat assignments at 24 hours before departure. How about the employees learn their own guidelines? I took the phone survey & gave ""1's"" all the way across. So, now I get to the airport. I couldn't believe what happened. As the Star Alliance Premier Gold I'm allowed 2 bags free of charge & my companion (my daughter) is allowed 1 bag. The employee must have been new because at one point there were 4 additional people standing around her because she was so sure I was to pay for a bag! We went round & round, she got her manager & he also didn't know what he was doing so to avoid missing my flight, I paid $105 & knew I'd have to deal with it later. The flight attendants treated us like idiot children. So incredibly rude. At one point, one of them stood in the aisle and yelled ""I'm serving coffee, every one put their seats up!"" What?

53,C Hakarsh,South Africa,2023-03-13,2,"The crew & the aircraft were excellent - we flew on a new A321NX  with friendly & hospitable crew who did their best to make the inflight experience one to remember. Unfortunately that is where the honeymoon period ends. Here are some highlights of what an ultra low-cost cattle class experience looks like on SAS: - Emergency Exit Row 30 is blocked off on both sides for crew which means that even if you had 69 Euros to spend on an amazing SAS GO Emergency Exit Row seat, you would rather be placed into a normal seat as the crew may have to rest (which BTW, none of the crew members did given that the stage length is 7 hours 30min. There were no earphones available as ""they weren't loaded by the relevant company"" - the relevant company is SAS & how could you allow for paying customers to fly without access to IFE for almost 8 hours over the Atlantic? One non-alcoholic drink allowed, at SAS, the focus is on ensuring that SAS Go customers pay 8 euros for a glass of wine while the flight attendants repeat three times over the PA system that it is only one non-alcoholic drink for you economy passengers. The WiFi costs around 18 Euros for the full flight, however, it only connects while you're over mainland Europe and when you are past Gander on the North American coast, in short, your WiFi connectivity is ""full flight"" but is actually 3 hours.  The meal choice is Lasagna and Lasagna only in the words of the cabin crew - in a rare event, where you do accept the lasagna, it is floating in a bed of water. Landing in Terminal 7 at JFK: you land at 10pm, the queue for immigration takes around an hour, it is hot inside the terminal, the baggage has come & go and when you exit the customs area, there are zero shops, kiosks or vending machines.

Also we were re-booked to an insane route, having to take 2 additional connecting flights which was unacceptable so we had to spend time and correct that as well. Then came the time for the flight. No vegetarian option available because we had 'low class' tickets so we are told that we have to prebook. We try this for the next flight but the meals are sold out (whatever that means). Customer service is only available for certain time intervals, so if you are in the US, as we were, we couldn't contact them at reasonable times. So we went to the desk (I already knew it was late to ask, because you have to pre-order the meals 24h ahead of time, although on the website the time of 18h is also mentioned) and the lady there had a terrible superior attitude and wouldn't even let me explain the situation.

Only one line for biz class at ALC at the check-in for SAS. No onboard magazine, plus the downloadable magazines/newspapers are very limited.

The only thing I can't accept is the bad behavior and lack of security. While we patiently waited for our flight, there was no announcement or further details. Unfortunately no one was there at the information point (until boarding of course). After boarding the flight attendant (a man in his 50's) did not want to help us or even answer us. We politely asked him where we can put our luggage and he replied with the middle finger. I was shocked! We tried but we couldn't find an open place to put them, so as you can imagine we had our 2 luggage on our knees and in between our legs for the whole trip. Of course we couldn't wear a belt. Last but not least, the other flight attendant when someone asked her for help, started dancing in the aisle and then another one started dancing with her.

85,S Keale,United States,2022-09-30,7,"I took a chance and bid on an upgrade on our outbound flight from Newark to Copenhagen on SAS and was very pleased when it was accepted. For this trip, we travelled with only hand luggage. As such, we were able to check in via the app and head straight to the lounge at Newark - thanks to the upgrade to SAS Plus (Premium Economy). We also had access arriving in Copenhagen. Was a nice perk to be able to take a shower and grab a bite before catching the connection to Rome. On the outbound to Copenhagen, the Plus seats onboard the SAS A350 were comfortable, wider, and had a decent recline and padding. One thing that was consistent about SAS on all our sectors was their punctuality. Every flight boarded early, pushed back on time and arrived early. The service onboard in SAS Plus was very good, the crew were very friendly and all smiles. Seemed to enjoy their work. The 2 meals were also very good, well presented and with free alcohol, pre-dinner drinks and also free wifi. The amenity kit was a shoe bag with a toothbrush and eyeshades, etc. A bit cheap in execution but might get some use out of it later. While the crew on the other sectors were also very friendly, there was a stark contrast in what you actually get in regular old economy. On the flight to and from Rome, it was just a cup of coffee with everything else including water available for purchase. On the flight back to Newark from Copenhagen, we flew on SAS' A321NX. It felt new, the seats were comfortable, legroom was decent. But being on a fully packed narrow body plane for 8 hours starts to wear on you a lot quicker than on the A350. With only 3 toilets all at the back, there was a constant stream of people up and down the aisle. The dinner and arrival snack service were slow and the meals themselves were somewhat basic. I thought the limit of just one drink with the meal was a bit cheap on the airline's part. Additional snacks and drinks were available throughout the flight but once again had to be purchased. As did wifi access in economy. The entertainment system was responsive and I did like the tail and belly cams on the A350, which were not available on the A321. Otherwise, the selection of movies and TV shows was small and dated. As I had booked this ticket about 4 months before, I was able to score a great fare deal which made it good value.

91,U Santer,United States,2022-09-09,1,"San Francisco to Gothenburg via Copenhagen. I had a flight booked for departure on 7th September 2022 from SFO to GOT. I called the SAS customer service number on Friday morning September 2nd 2022, to add my pet fee since I was planning on flying with him. The customer service guy helped me and that was billed to my debit card. That day when I called back customer service with more questions, and waited on hold for an hour before getting a person to pick up. She would answer one question, and if I asked more she would hang up on me. Yes, this is SAS customer service. They hang up on customers. Anyway, on Tuesday September 6th 2022 I called SAS customer service to ask if I could have the pet fee refunded since the pet's travel documents were not all available and I had decided to leave him with someone else while I’m gone. The lady at customer service that day said that was alright, that the amount would be refunded without any issues if I fill out a form on the website. I filled out the form, and got an email response saying I can’t get a refund even though my pet was never on that flight. This gets worse. On the 7th September 2022, I arrived at the SFO airport at 3:05pm I remember checking my phone for time, I got to the SAS check in desk, and the ladies there completely ignored me. I went to see if there was more desks for SAS check in, and there was none, so I came back. When I came back to the SAS check in, these ladies turned around and left the desk at 3:15pm. The flight was departing at 4:25pm. These ladies never bothered to announce for any more customers checking in before leaving and to make matters worse, they left earlier than they should have. According to SAS customer service that I talked to the next morning, SAS check in is supposed to leave their desk an hour before departure meaning they should have left at 3:25pm the earliest, and at least announce before they leave for any last calls. The fact that I was standing in front of their desk and waving and yelling to get their attention, but they still turned around and left was beyond me. Even worse was the customer service the next day that would hang up on me while I was speaking. This airline has me at a loss for words for the amount of disregard for the customer. For a company that claims that customer service is their priority, yet still treat a customer the way they treated me, I wonder how they treat their employees and everything else that goes into the quality of their service. Maybe that is why their employees treat the customers so badly. Maybe they are not happy. I know this has been the absolute worst airline experience in my entire life! I have flown so many times before and no airline has ever been this terrible with their customer.

101,P Harper,United Kingdom,2022-08-12,1,"Dreadful experience and I am done with this shoddy airline. I have flown from Longyearbyen to Oslo dozens of times and SAS never fail to disappoint; Longyearbyen airport can only handle one aircraft and one aircraft worth of passengers at any one time, so why SAS chose to have 2 flight departing within 2.5 hours of one another is beyond me. The result? Two flights worth of passengers trying to check in at the same time, only one staffed check in desk, nobody around to help passengers who are having trouble using the self service check in system, security totally overwhelmed, nobody taking charge to sort the shambolic chaos, just inanely optimistic PA announcements asking those on the later flight in the security queue to 'step aside' - where to? The security area is too narrow to step anywhere! 2 hours and 15 minutes to check in and get through security! To add insult to injury, SAS cabin crew within Norway seem to enjoy standing at the end of the aisle while passengers struggle to get luggage into the overhead bins-everyone was stressed enough as it was after the dreadful security and check in experience, so a bit of help would have been nice, but no. Then the Tromso customs clearance pantomime - if you have a tight connection at Oslo and you are flying from Longyearbyen via Tromso, forget it - you almost certainly won't make it - or if by some miracle you do, you will be sweaty and stressed by the time you have sprinted the full length of Oslo airport. So, you have to clear customs at Tromso if arriving from Longyearbyen - SAS check in staff at Longyearbyen tell me I have to take hold baggage off and check it in again at Tromso. SAS cabin crew tell me I don't need to do this, just take off hand baggage and clear customs. SAS ground crew at Tromso say they are not sure!! Thankfully the passport control staff knew the answer, but beware, Tromso airport is currently undergoing redevelopment, so we had to queue for over half an hour in the rain to get to what I can only describe as two shipping containers welded together where passport control is currently located. Over an hour to get to the passport control point. 55 minutes scheduled for the stop in Tromso, and guess what? Almost 2 hours later the pantomime is over, everyone is stressed out and many people onboard now know they have zero chance of making their connection at Oslo. Oslo to London smoother, but this is operated by another arm of SAS who have their act together a bit more it seems. But why oh why do SAS at Oslo insist on showing the boarding gate on the screen, allow passengers to head into the gate lounge, only to then rudely boot them out of the gate lounge and make them queue again to get into the gate lounge - this happens every time! Why? Just don't allow passengers in until you are ready! This isn't rocket science SAS!

104,Jorgen Aberg ,Sweden,2022-07-28,3,"The big day, to travel transatlantic again after the pandemic, had finally arrived. I got a bit carried away, so I decided to bid for an upgrade to business, which I did win. I was looking forward to trying the new A350 cabin on a SAS flight of almost 11 hours. However, it turned out to be quite a lackluster experience. I really liked the plane, and as many have stated in the past, you do feel much better after a long-haul on the A350, compared to other aircraft. When it comes to more negative findings, there is unfortunately quite a lot. First off, the food, which was back to full normal service, was simply not up to standards. The salmon starter should have been cooked for 5-10 minutes, not 5-10 hours! The so called salad, which cost 10 cents to produce, was not very attractive. The wine list was decent, even more so if you get the red you order, and not something else from the list. The IFE was appealing from a technical perspective, but contents left a lot be desired, especially new films and music. The staff was somewhat standoffish and aloof, and many of them did not seem to enjoy their jobs one bit. Priority baggage is not not a known concept at LAX. I had to wait for all other bags to come through before the priority-tagged bags appeared on the belt.

108,Arielle Paist,United States,2022-07-13,1,"I was left stranded in Copenhagen on 25 June as the last leg of my flight was abruptly canceled. My original itinerary was ATL > ORD > CPH > SPU. I waited for 9 hours to speak with a customer service agent once I landed in Copenhagen. I was told that there was no opportunity to get to Croatia and I would have to make my own arrangements. I was not provided any accommodations, food, or direction. My luggage was lost and I was left alone to fend for myself in an unknown country that I didn’t intend to be in. I had to purchase a hotel for two nights and navigate my way through this terrible situation without any clothing. I missed my cruise that was paid for and set to depart in Croatia. On my second day in Copenhagen, I went back to the airport and was thankfully provided a flight to return back home. This situation was the most terrible experience I have ever had with an airline. SAS failed me every step of the way and had no concern or care for my safety. I will not be able to get back the money spent on the cruise this forced me to miss or the failed time spent wasted on my vacation. As of today, I still have yet to receive my lost baggage or a response to my submitted claim for my bag. They failed me in all ways and I have no idea how they are still in business.

Meanwhile they lost our luggage and delivered them 3 days after our arrival. We were supposed to return on 28th of June but after 6-7 hours delay at Keflavik airport they cancelled our return flight and after that they send us an email saying that our booked was cancelled and they are going to give us a refund! No customer service at the airport or by phone was reachable. The thing was that they have an alternative to give us but they didn't want to. After many negotiations with the ground staff of SAS they made a phone call and booked us a returned flight through Oslo. We finally landed back home at June 30.

123,S Murter,United States,2022-05-30,5,"My outbound flight was generally pleasant except for a very small and crowded lounge at O'Hare. The return flight was more problematic. First, they had no signs at the entrance to the ticketing lines indicating economy passenger vs. Gold Card, Business lines. I wondered if this was the reason for the Gold Card/Business line being so long. The second unpleasantry was the ticketing agent asking me three times whether I alone had packed my bags. This interrogation might have been customary 25 years ago, but I was taken aback on this recent occasion. I finally asserted that one ""yes"" should be sufficient. The third unpleasantry was the 1000 Krone charge for the Attestation form at the gate. While I admit that this form was my responsibility, this form probably only cost the airline about 10 Krone to produce. After paying more than $1900 for my ticket, one could assert that SAS was either petty or punitive or both for making such a charge. The final complaint had to do with a responsibility that was mine, but about SAS could be much more helpful. My ticket was listed as a P class ticket on all legs. I had connecting flights with United. The small print at the bottom of the second page notes that Premium economy flights revert to Economy on code share (non-SAS) legs.

Moreover, you are cramped into something that best can be compared to a vise. Its terribly a horrifying experience for 9 hours. Of course, to add insult to injury, SAS transatlantic service is not comparable to a regular airline when it comes to anything else either: food, beverages, IFE selection. It's much closer resembling RyanAir than, say, KLM or Lufthansa. But when you are stuck in the type of seating I was, that really doesn't matter. All you will want is to get out of there. A truly horrifying experience. SAS product is so poor that the advantage of having a direct flight across the Atlantic from Scandinavian airports is entirely wasted.

132,P Lanson,United States,2022-04-25,2,"We originally booked our SAS flights back in 2021, with our plan to fly to Copenhagen in December 2021. We had to reschedule our flights due to Omicron and a lockdown in Denmark. SAS would not allow us to cancel our flights or even get a credit for a later flight, we had to rebook and pick a new date immediately - during the pandemic.  Check in at CPH was a nightmare. We had our CDC approved BiomaxNOW test results (NEG). But when we went to the counter. The agent told us SAS did not accept them. (Their StarAlliance partner UNITED does). Agent also asked for our vaccine cards? (Not a US requirement). We raced to get an airport COVID test at significant additional cost and inconvenience. We went to the checkin line and got a different agent who barely even reviewed our test status and never asked for our vaccine cards, much to our dismay. On board experience is fine, the A350 is an amazing jet. We left a few minutes late (no explanation) and took off. The meal in SAS Go was fine, but SAS makes sure to inform passengers several times you get one free drink and must pay for alcohol and snacks. (It's an 8 hour flight). Oh but make sure your USB port is not being used on takeoff.  Our outbound journey was a even bigger disaster. The night before, SAS cancelled our non stop to CPH and routed us on BA thru London, with an airline and terminal change at Heathrow. Not even a thru connection on BA, we were SAS Plus. With a 4 hour layover in LHR we had to retrieve our luggage, exit the UK Border, travel by train to a different terminal and re-checkin with SAS. Ugh.

135,K Dinos,Denmark,2022-04-20,1,"The level of customer mistreatment goes beyond reason with this company. I booked a 12 hour direct flight (CPH to LAX) for myself and my wife a whole 2 months before the trip. For a lengthy flight like this, I purchased specifically selected seats (for almost 80 euros) as an extra to the already overpriced ticket, to have a minimum amount of comfort during the trip. During the check in process, I noticed that the seats I paid for were not respected, as they decided to assign two completely random seats in my boarding pass without any notice. I didn't complain although they were a lot worse than my initial selection. And then, on the trip back, they went a step further and assigned us the worst possible location, exactly in the center of a 4-seat setup, in the middle of the plane. I called the customer service who suggested that I ask about it at the check-in counter at LAX, they in turn said that I should speak to someone at the gate where they asked me to call the customer service! They apparently had a fully booked flight and they couldn't help. Nobody was willing to answer why I paid for seat selection for no apparent reason and why I wasn't at least offered a refund for the non-existing ""service"" I purchased as an extra when they decided to change my booking details without even letting me know. Perhaps it was my mistake for thinking that SAS is a serious airline. Next time, I will know better.

They seemed to say yes, but when I got on board I was cheek by jowl with a ""spreader"" - someone who invaded my space with great abandon. But first - getting onto the plane: I really don't like terminal B at Newark - low ceilings, crowded, often (as again yesterday) the TSA pre-check and priority lanes in security are not in operation, the lounge (gold card) is small and gets very crowded. And then onto the plane which - at least in my section - was completely full. Meal service so-so. But they charge for wine? What international airline ever does that? Warm white wine and you have to pay for it? On a night flight? Which cost $1200 round trip?

142,Randy Cartet,United States,2022-02-22,1,"My wife and started the boarding process in Copenhagen. It got off on a negative position right at the beginning. When time came to board it was delayed. The reason was they forgot a lady needing a wheelchair and left her on board. This set us back fifteen or twenty minutes. Our flight for the next flight was tight’s timing was tight anyway. Not knowing the next airport and trying to navigate it adds time with this unnecessary occurrence makes it even more worrisome. Once we boarded pilot came on intercom and seem to make a joke about it. Assuring us not to worry about it. That did not make us feel too good. At this point we decided to talk tot he flight attendants. They would not answer any questions and appeared to be aggravated we even talk to them. We were ordered to our seats. We complied and settled in. Once flight got off ground and beverage service began request for drinks began. We did not understand them and the attendant refused to discuss. Finally we got drinks requested with them throwing them on our tray. Once we landed the trouble began. We had to run through the airport not knowing if we were going in the right direction or not. It was a nightmare and we were wet from perspiring we we reached our gates. It was just in the Nick of time. We remained optimistic about this one. It was not to be. We received the exact same treatment on this flight too. In ways it was worse with the attendants being down right rude at times. We received the same treatment for beverage and food service and they actually ignored my wife. Had it not been for the person sitting beside her, she would not have been served. I explained to my wife this probably was just for this leg of our trip. Once food service was complete the attendants hide themselves until the last hour and twenty minutes of the flights. This was a long flight, approximately seven hours. They must have found a corner to sleep in, not sure. When plane was ready to land we were told we’re late getting in, but not to worry we would not miss our next flight. That was true but what was not said was we going to have an ordeal getting to our gate. The airport in Copenhagen was very hard to traverse. Nobody to ask how, when and where. We just made our gate in time once again pilot seem to this all was good not to worry. The sad part of all this is nobody seemed to care!

144,A Pedersen ,Norway,2022-02-06,1,"I had booked a flight with SAS OSL-TOS in Plus Pro with departure 17.00 with two segments. SAS canceled the flight and moved me to another flight. That may happen sometimes. Strike 1: SAS moved me to a flight departing 14.30 with 3 segments. This was strange as there was a flight at 15.30 with two segments that was closer to the original booking. Strike 2: I followed the instructions and checked the new flight online and tried to change it there. 14 days after involuntary rescheduling the change should be without fees for all tickets. I was asked for a surplus and a 600 NOK fee. Strike 3: Contacting support I was told that I should not follow the instructions I received and change the ticket online. I should simply call support. Did I not understand that? Strike 4: Later meetings at work made 15.30 impossible. The original 17.00 would still have been OK, but I had to go for 18.50 ruining evening plans. Plus Pro gives change or cancelation without any fees over Plus, but online I got a 600 NOK fee. Strike 5: Contacting support again with estimated wait of 21 minutes, even with EBG priority. That was too long even without priority. The extraordinary situation creating long wait times have lasted for several years with SAS. Strike 6: Callback for support was not working. Understood that after waiting 35 minutes in vain for the callback. Strike 7: Calling in and identifying with my frequent flyer number my 40 minutes wait was ignored and I was but in the back of the line. Strike 8: After over 1 hour I was told that I should  not pay the fee. I should receive a link to pay for the change. I received a link for payment and there the 600 NOK fee was added again. Strike 9: I contacted support again and was explained that even if the difference between Plus and Plus Pro was fees for changes my Pros Pro booking had the fee as there was a promotion when I bought the ticket. So it basically was a Plus and not a Plus Pro ticket even if my booking says something else. Strike 10: With a price difference of 3 NOK between the 15.30 and 18.50 flights I had to pay 1364 NOK for the change. Strike 11: After getting my final booking I checked it online with no seating selected as expected and then selected 5A. Checked in online, boarded after some delay through the gate and thought everything was OK. No word or message from SAS. After being seated someone else also turned up with 5A on his boarding pass. Strike 12: Crew arrived to assist and I was asked if I has changed flight. Yes, I said, but I had selected a seat for this flight and heard nothing from SAS. Well, that is not how it works with SAS I was told. If my original booking is changed selecting a seat on the new flight is of no use as SAS was going to move me again to a random seat anyway. I had to move to 14D in regular economy and that was it. Strike 13: With others complaining they contacted SAS and had the seating corrected during the flight. Got to 5A and the other guy could move back to his girlfriend, which he preferred. I heard no one saying sorry and have not heard from SAS weeks after the event. Strike 14: Food and drink service for Plus was choosing from the snack trolley. Muffins? Chips? A chocolate bar? Strike 15: Same seats in Plus and in Go and 3 persons shoulder to shoulder.

146,W Denten,Norway,2022-01-09,2,"I have used SAS multiple times and always dirty aircrafts and unpolite flight attendants. On December the 21st my experience with SAS was brought to the next level when after landing it seemed that my backpack got stolen with lots of important things inside it. I fell asleep during the flight since I had a short night and woke up after landing. I was not in a rush to get out as I was still waking up, had almost 5h time for connection flight and due new Covid variant I didn´t feel like to get in the crowd. So I read the news on my phone while passengers were stepping out. Than the fun started after finding only empty cabinets. The flight attendants only could say that I had to hurry to get out the aircraft and didn´t give any advise. At the service desk they only said that I had to go to found and lost (missing X) to register my lost item there. Later on I found out that SAS should give me a case number since this incident happened on the aircraft but they are refusing. Customer service is refusing to give me a PIR number and says I need to contact in Oslo the service desk. I did this multiple times and also on my return home I visit them live but they keep on refusing. Customer service is doing the same. I have to consider my backpack as lost since also the police has dropped the case. Flight companies should start to understand that a travel insurance is not always the solution because some things just can´t be replaced. The flight attendants at SAS have a true Scandinavian mentality. If it doesn´t involve them, they really don´t care. I´m a Dutch living in Norway and most people in the Scandinavian countries are raised that you should not interfere with other people business and this applies also on business level. So a good customer service you really can forget with SAS. I have now decided to use only KLM. This companies has its flaws too but the flight attendants do upper most their best that passengers are not sneaking around during the flight.

153,H Lee,United States,2021-12-15,1,"Today, while I was at work, I received a phone call from the airport, asking me whether my family and I will be boarding our flight. I was shocked and confused, as I booked our reservations for a departure on Thursday, December 16 from LAX. Still on the phone with the airport, I went back to double check all of my documents, which all showed our departure date as December 16. Anxious and confused, I spoke to a representative on the phone from SAS. I was shocked when she told me that my flight had been rescheduled, without my permission or confirmation, to two days earlier on December 14. The SAS representative informed me that I should have received an email notifying me of this schedule change. Unfortunately, the email in question was sent directly to my spam folder, and I was never made aware of the major schedule change. She told me that upon receipt of the email, I had only a 15-day window to confirm the new schedule. However, of course, because I was not even aware that I received any sort of email notification, I was unable to consider or confirm the schedule change. Unfortunately, to my utter disappointment in the company, SAS took my silence as approval for the new departure date, which is both ridiculous and deceiving. Moreover, after hours on the phone with two separate representatives from SAS, I was told that because I was not on board the first December 14 flight, all of my money and bookings were completely lost and unrecoverable, including both departure and return flights. It is completely outrageous that I am not even granted the right to my return flights (Zurich to Copenhagen and Copenhagen to LAX), which are not dependent at all on the flights that were rescheduled by the airline, and all of which I have already paid for. Because I have spent over four months planning my two-week stay in Switzerland with family, and because SAS deceptively cancelled my entire air travel itinerary, after I first learned about a schedule change only 2 days before my planned departure, I have been forced to completely rebook all of my flights. Because I had to book new flights on such short notice, and because of limited space this close to my trip, I was given no choice but to pay four times the cost of my original booking with SAS, which has placed my family in a financial burden and has stolen the joy and excitement from our long-awaited holiday trip. I believe the only possible way for SAS to redeem itself in this shrewd and unfair situation is to refund the entire cost of our family's SAS booking, including taxes, fees, and additional baggage, as well as offer some sort of financial compensation for the extremely high prices we were forced to pay for new last-minute flights.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Zurich,December 2021,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Los Angeles,Zurich,,Negative,-0.9753,  today work receive phone call airport ask whether family board shock confused booked reservation departure thursday december 16 lax still phone airport go back double check document show departure date december 16 anxious confuse speak representative phone sa shock reschedule without permission confirmation two day earlier december 14 sa representative inform receive email notifying schedule change unfortunately email question send directly spam folder never make aware major schedule change upon receipt email window confirm new schedule however course aware receive sort email notification unable consider confirm schedule change unfortunately utter disappointment company sas take silence approval new departure date ridiculous deceive moreover hour phone two separate representative sas board first december 14 money booking completely lose unrecoverable include departure return flight completely outrageous grant right return flight zurich copenhagen copenhagen lax dependent flight reschedule already pay spend four month plan stay switzerland family sa deceptively cancel entire air travel itinerary first learn schedule change 2 day plan departure force completely rebook flight book new flight short notice limited space close trip give choice pay four time cost original book sa place family financial burden steal joy excitement holiday trip believe possible way sa redeem shrewd unfair situation refund entire cost family sas book include tax fee additional baggage well offer sort financial compensation extremely high price force pay new flight

173,R Marson,Norway,2021-08-01,1,"I have met nothing but issues these last few years trying to find logic in how they work. Constant delays, every flight I've traveled with this company over the last few years have been delayed one way or another, whether its domestic flight or international. they have been delayed all of them. I understand that things can happen before during or when landing that can cause delay. but when its happened every time i fly with them, I've reached the end of my patience. In the last trip i took with this AL (12th of July - 31th of July (Was suppose to be the 30th) but because of delay i had to spend the night at an airport hotel. Roughly a week before my first flight, my trip's return date got rebooked, and with covid happening and quarantine being a thing i chose the specific return date for the quarantine, and the rebook date was making it so that the last day of quarantine would be the first day of my job. So i was trying to reach the support line several days in a row, spending several hours on hold to get help - I never did get through to them. On my way to the destination with this company just a few weeks ago the flight was delayed to Oslo by over 30 minutes. now these 30 minutes were crucial to make it to the connecting flight which i didn't make and because of that i had to go back out and through to checkin to get help again.  I dashed through the airport in hopes to make it, but to no avail. The airline had no more flights to my destination. the issue for me isn't the direct thing that i missed that flight but the lack of preparation for these situations, whether they hold the flight for just a few minutes for the people on the flight that have connecting flights with the same company or quicker assistance in said situation instead of having to run around the entire airport just to get help. In the end i got transfered to a different airline, and reached my destination eventually. When going to retrieve my baggage from baggage claim my suitcase was nowhere to be found, when talking to baggage assistance by the belt was told it was never loaded onto the plane. I had to wait 2 days getting my baggage back.  Last but not least the return: plane took off 30 minutes past expected departure time. missed my connected flight and had to spend the night.

For example: one is not allowed to change seats at any time, even if it would improve social distancing, if sleeping while your facemask is not covering your nose and mouth you will be woken from sleep and ordered to correct that grievous error, the order in which groups of rows embark or disembark makes no difference at all to overall Covid infection risk, due to no distancing during the flight.

I bought a business class ticket on February 7th for an SAS flight LHR - ORD on May 21st. SAS didn't cancel the flight until the llast minute, (May 17th for a May 21st flight ). I immediately asked for a full refund. From the start of the pandemic SAS had been contacting me about ""uncertainties"" for my flight and offering me a voucher. I always declined. When they finally cancelled the flight, I immediately requested a full refund as per EU law. But instead of a refund, SAS offers for a voucher became much more frequent. I always declined these. Then suddenly SAS went quiet until August. I called once or twice in between to remind them that I was still expecting a refund. They always told me that they were ""working hard"" In August (still no refund), offers of a voucher began again in earnest. I called SAS once again to remind them again that I was still expecting a refund. I finally received notice on September 4th from SAS that the refund is being issued - 6 months after the ticket was issued and 3 months after the flight was cancelled. Why did SAS delay like this? I had similar longhaul bookings on BA, Air France, KLM,Swissair, Lufthansa, and ANA and I had shorthaul bookings on BA and Easyjet. All these were cancelled by the airlines too, but refunds were issued promptly. SAS was shameless with its constant voucher proposals. SAS was shameless in claiming that they were ""working hard"" to manage refunds. SAS has lost the loyalty of this premium passenger for good.

201,J Holton,Germany,2020-09-03,1,SAS is not a good airline. This airline does not care about customers. Their business class service is downgraded to basic economy - no water or food served on a 4 hour flight - front toilets reserved for crew. Lounge closed. no free middle seat. no priority boarding - only 1 pcs of carry on and they do it all because of Corona. ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oslo to Longyearbyen,September 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,1,no,True,Oslo,Longyearbyen,,Positive,0.8555,  sas good care customer business class service downgrade basic economy water food serve 4 hour front toilet reserve crew lounge close free middle seat priority board 1 pc carry corona
202,Antonsen Helge,Norway,2020-09-02,1,In the past years SAS has dramatically reduced ground service and onboard service. Everything that was left has now eliminated - due to COVID-19 as they say. While they eliminated all onboard and ground services and all lounges are closed and all onboard catering is eliminated they are saying this is to reduce interactions between customers and the flight attendants. So far so good. A lady in front of me was carrying a dog which was in a basket in the aisle seat: half of the flight the behinds of two flight attendants who were petting the dog We’re stuck in my face. My visibility: two butts. While everybody had to wear a mask - which I fully support - it turns out that the crew does not wear it while in the galley. They are not good role models. Already before the pandemic SAS downgraded the onboard product. All that was left is now eliminated. On my opinion it is one of the worst airlines a and definitely the worst airline in the star alliance. The only positive thing I have to report is that they did not lose my luggage this time - but if you put it in context that i was traveling only with carry-on this is not too big of an achievement.,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oslo to  ‎Longyearbyen‎,July 2020,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Oslo, ‎Longyearbyen‎,,Neutral,0.4201,  past year sas dramatically reduce ground service onboard service everything leave eliminated due say eliminate onboard ground service lounge close onboard cater eliminate say reduce interaction customer attendant far good lady front carry dog basket aisle seat half behind two attendant pet dog stick face visibility two butt everybody wear mask fully support turn crew wear galley good role model already pandemic sa downgrade onboard product leave eliminated opinion one worst airline definitely worst star alliance positive thing report lose luggage time put context traveling big achievement
203,Marta Xavier,Portugal,2020-08-31,1,"Connecting flights were supposed to have been in April 2019 but were cancelled due to strike. At that time, SAS guaranteed I would be eligible to receive a full refund. I went on with my work related journey by train all the way to the North of Sweden and back. Once returned to Portugal (thank you TAP for making it possible), I applied for a refund, but received no response. Contacted the company that had been responsible for the Lisbon - Stockholm flight (again, TAP) and they redirected me to their eSky agency, who assisted me. Submitted an application for another three times after that and, again, never received a response from SAS. It has been 1 year and four months since that strike. Before this incidence, I did fly SAS twice, service was excellent. Perhaps I should apologize in some way for giving such a bad review for this one round-trip event, but this is all I can give to those who don't keep their word and don't respect their customers.

No bottled water no crisps or other snacks. It was made clear (before the date of traveling) that there would be no fast track and no access to the SAS lounge. What wasn't explained until we were being boarded was that plus passengers were to be boarded last. On boarding we were all handed a sealed hand wipe. And after the safety demonstrations, we were told that only the aft lavatories (2) would be available for the passengers. Thus meaning that the crew (6) would have the exclusive use of the forward lavatory.

Their group department are the most arrogant and non-customer service oriented people I've come across. They don't care at all how your group is seated. It is apparently completely normal to place parents and children 10 rows apart, the same for couples or friends traveling together. Even though the flights are full, they still dare to say ""try to arrange it at the airport"". No possibility to arrange this online, the group department pretends to be deaf for your arguments that such an approach is just welcoming big problems. Then the other advice ""arrange it on the plane itself"". Yeah right, playing musical chairs with 50 people on a single-aisle plane. I just wonder these people see what nonsense they are telling.

245,B Kadsen,Netherlands,2019-09-09,2,"Stavanger to Amsterdam via Copenhagen. On 6th September I was at Stavanger Airport for a flight to Amsterdam via Copenhagen. Unfortunately there was a delay and SAS kept pushing the departure time further back. After we finally boarded SK1877 the second engine of the aeroplane was not serviceble and we had to return to the gate. This gave a huge problem with the amount of passengers being stuck at Stavanger. The biggest problem for me was that I was unable to catch my connecting flight from Copenhagen to Amsterdam. My complaint about the whole situation is that SAS forced all the passengers to stay on Stavanger airport to go with flight SK1877 to Copenhagen (a flight that departed eventually at 00:50) I didnt want to go to Copenhagen in the first place, because I needed to go to Amsterdam and I rather stayed in Stavanger to get booked on a direct flight later that day. (several direct flights leaving stavanger to amsterdam). There was no way of contacting the SAS customer service by phone (tried several times) and no SAS deck at the airport in reach. Now I was forced to go Copenhagen where I was further away from home and in a bigger mess because of the strikes at Copenhagen, well known to SAS. At arrival they gave us no information and no rebooking on next flights. A hotel voucher was offered for a hotel that is 40 minutes away from the airport (in a different city) and a phone number for the SAS customer service to call after 07:00 a.m. I had to book a flight with another airline just to get out of Copenhagen, with my suitcase lost in the pile of other bagage at Copenhagen airport. I'm travelling a lot and have encountered many delays and cancelled flights, but this is the worst service I have ever seen with any airline. Even after the difficult online process of getting refunds for my flights, the official answer of SAS is that their process time is 4 weeks. I feel mistreated.

I checked in online before boarding, and everything looked ok, but when I got to Copenhagen and wanted to check on my flight as I had an almost 7-hour layover, I had to check in again. I went to the SAS customer service desk to get boarding passes and to ask for their lounge as I paid for it.

Took the numbers of my tickets, seen photos of my luggage (thank God I took them before leaving) and she reassured me, they will be on the flight with me.

I called the 800 number, but they were less than helpful, and the guy even hung up on me, when I tried to find a different number on how to contact them. I mean, they have flights on Saturday as well, so if the customer service does not operate in the airport on Saturday, where the people claim their luggage if lost? So, I rather stick with Lufthansa, but for sure I will not fly again with SAS.

Firstly, when purchasing the ticket, I picked this option because it was one of the lowest rates traveling from San Francisco to Greece via Copenhagen. It was unclear that this included no baggage ($80 each way), can't pick seats (until 24 hrs before flight), pay for your drinks (on the 11 hr flight) and pay for food and drinks (on the 4 hr flight). By the time you add this all up (including purchasing seats for all 4 of my flights for fear of being put in the middle), the ticket is now almost $500 extra. Oh, and to avoid milling around the airport for 12 hours in Copenhagen lay over, I stayed at an airport hotel. The seats are tiny, there is no place to stand in the aircraft (except right outside the toilet doors in a passage about 3 ft wide, and hardly any leg room.

268,G Meissen,Germany,2019-06-20,1,"Dusseldorf to Oslo. Avoid SAS at all costs if you're flying economy. SAS does everything to give you the worst possible service on economy - low cost carriers like Ryan Air or easyJet are a blessing in comparison - in order to fleece you with their premium options. We had a cancellation and SAS hugely disappointed. The main issue is that the flight was cancelled at 10PM, and no service and support from the airline at all was provided until calling the hotline the next morning at 9AM. Outside the legally obligated food vouchers delivered via a contractor at the airport. That lack of care and support led to the early morning flight offered by SAS to be fully booked out by normal customers and we with our cancelled flight were left with an afternoon flight which had huge consequential damages in terms of lost connections for us. I find it appalling that an airline cares so little about its customers that new paying customers still have priority over your cancelled trip and also from a legal perspective the airline definitely failed its duty to try and get you from A to B in face of cancellation as fast as possible. Needless to say the options for remedy with support proved completely inflexible. Almost fraudulently, I also found out SAS uses different booking codes and Airlines to get out of legal responsibilities, apparently our other trip in the journey was booked with Scandinavian which is a different airline than SAS and therefore SAS refused a refund for this part of the journey. While I certainly agreed to conditions on ticket and have no legal recourse this sort of skulduggery is clearly set up by the airline to make your life as miserable as possible and force you to book their premium priced options if you want proper service.

It was busy and I eventually got through to a customer agent who told me that they didn't have other flights than the one I got rebooked on and that he had to check if I can get booked on another airline and that I had to wait on the line. I was left waiting for half an hour. This is unacceptable. I eventually had trips (on other airlines) from Oslo Gardermoen airport, and each time I was there, I asked the ticket desk staff if they could help me.

The seat has plenty of leg room (go with the even numbers to get a seat with no gap to the window).

Overall consistently negative experience on 3 flights during winter holidays: 1) all 3 flights were delayed by at least an hour. Surprisingly in none of the cases the delay caused any reaction from the airline staff, nobody even tried to move quicker, everybody acted as if this is business-as-usual which made it so frustrating. When you have a 45min flight, and it becomes a 2,5 hour struggle, you expect people to do something about it except say on the speaker “yes, we are late, but we’re flying already and there is nothing we can do”. You have to pay for everything during the flight (even on a 2-hour flight between Tromso and Oslo), although the airline doesn’t position itself as a low-cost carrier.

304,Kathleen Ellis,United States,2018-11-22,1,"This week, I have already been on SAS flights 3 times, and will be on a 4th Saturday. My first two flights were quite enjoyable. Friendly, attentive staff and a clean plane. However, on my flight today (11/21), from Athens to Copenhagen, I experienced the worst customer service of my life. I was waiting very patiently for the restroom, when a flight attendant, who at this point had not noticed me, went to check to see if the bathroom was open. Upon realizing it was not, she glanced back, saw me waiting and pulled the curtain shut, hitting my face with it (no apology or acknowledgement of wrongdoing). (I also feel that it’s necessary to include that the same flight attendant pulled the curtain in my mother face in a very rude fashion as well.) When the gentleman in front of me left the restroom, she opened the curtain for him to return to his seat. I started towards the bathroom, at this point more confused than upset. The flight attendant proceeded to put her hand in my face, getting within an inch of me, and said “no, wait” and proceeded to go to the restroom herself. I can understand needing to use the restroom. I can understand needing to go before a paying customer if it was time to prepare for landing (which it was not, we were roughly 2 hours into a 3 hour flight). I can understand wanting the curtain shut to maintain privacy for the flight attendants. What I can not understand is the blatant rudeness and mistreatment of a passenger, especially without any signs of remorse. I am nothing short of appalled, I have never seen or experienced such horrific customer service.

311,Kyle Johnson,Sweden,2018-10-03,2,"Stockholm to Frankfurt. Unfortunately SAS and its hub Arlanda airport get only worse. Regarding check-in, long a problem spot for SAS/Star Alliance at Arlanda Terminal 5, it is clear that throughput far exceeds the capacity of the staff/facilities to move customers through. For Star Alliance flights the presence of the self-drop counters continues to serve no function, as they cannot be used for transfers conducted by partner airlines. (Why? A mystery). This yields a situation where 7-8 counters are backed up with a 30 minutes+ queue, bag drop off queues are blended with check-in queues, and self drop off queues stand essentially empty as the system itself precludes their use. This combination provides a tremendous delay. A 5 minute process becomes 40+ owing to poor management and poor implementation of SAS resources, yielding great frustration with SAS and Star Alliance, particularly ironic given how utterly smoothly SAS-partner Lufthansa’s hubs are run. SAS/Arlanda have some serious benchmarking and reorganization to do. How can it be, after so many years, that the situation seems only to get worse, rather than better?",,Business,Business Class,Stockholm to Frankfurt,October 2018,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,2,no,True,Stockholm,Frankfurt,,Negative,-0.9652,  stockholm frankfurt unfortunately sas hub arlanda airport get bad regard long problem spot alliance arlanda terminal 5 clear throughput far exceed capacity move customer star alliance flight presence counter continue serve function use transfer conduct partner airline mystery yield situation counter back 30 queue bag drop queue blend queue self drop queue stand essentially empty system precludes use combination provide tremendous delay 5 minute process become owe poor management poor implementation sa resource yield great frustration sa star alliance particularly ironic give utterly smoothly lufthansa hub run serious benchmarking reorganization many year situation seem get bad rather well

We purchased 4 SAS Plus tickets but when we boarded the plane, we were shocked to learn that 3 of us were assigned to one row while other SAS Plus passengers in front of us, beside us and for several rows behind us received an empty seat in between two seats. The seating reassignment was essentially a downgrade because of overbooking without any compensation. When we checked-in, we were asked by the staff at the check-in counter whether or not we wanted to take the earlier flight. Since we made arrangements to meet our tour guide later, we did not agree and politely refused. The staff was then on the phone for several minutes before being able to print our boarding passes. We were not told of the change in seating arrangement and only found out on the plane. Being the only family onboard the plane that received this treatment, it felt as though we were treated unfairly because we were travelling as a family and was a traumatic experience for us.

321,Jacob Kollar,Netherlands,2018-08-18,5,"Amsterdam to Klaipeda via Copenhagen. In 2001 I took took a flight with SAS from Amsterdam to Stockholm and enjoyed one of the best short haul flights I had experienced. Great food, great service, great comfort. But, that was 17 years ago. As traditional airlines have cut costs in relation to competition from budget alternatives, I would have to say, of the airlines I've used, SAS have compromised their product the most. The only way they differentiate themselves from budget airlines when flying short-haul, is you get a little bit of extra leg room—and free coffee and tea on flights over 80 minutes. The boarding situation was fairly chaotic, full flights on both AMS to CPH and on the return leg. On this occasion I travelled with my physically disabled child who requires extra assistance. Despite communicating this this ahead of time, outbound, they were completely unprepared, and we had to wrestle a bit to have our needs met. They also had us board last, which was extremely awkward and difficult for the passengers that had already boarded. On the return leg however, they were excellent. Airport staff were ready to meet us and transport us to the connecting flight. With regard to this, and in general, the cabin staff were friendly and helpful. The A320's on both legs were not well cleaned. Slightly grimy throughout the cabin. The plane used for the CPH to AMS flight was particularly bad. During taxiing, the cabin was bombarded with what could best be described as horrible low pitched squeal. In contrast however, the CRJ900's were both very well maintained (operated by City Jet). In summary, as previously alluded to, it seems this airline is barely above budget status these days. At times, that little bit extra shone through, but for the most part, it was functional, it got us where we needed to go, but it is not worth the extra few €'s that you usually have to pay to fly with them.

But no, it turns out they cancelled my reservation a few days after making it. I didnt have time to argue there, so i said, ""please re activate the reservation."" ""No, we cant do that, it is cancelled"". ""But are there seats left?""

325,M Garnecka,Norway,2018-07-29,1,"Split to Oslo via Stockholm. Friday, July 20, 2018, I received at. 19.20 a sms from SAS that the plane the following day will be delayed 2 hours. The departure should originally be from Split at. 10.10, 21 July 2018. Intermediate in Stockholm, and so on to Oslo. Arrival 14.35. It goes without saying that costumer service at SAS closes at. 19, and does not open until 9 days after. Split airport is one of the worst in the world. No doubt. I'm promised that if I want, I'll have to get a baggage in Stockholm. The departure will be moved to 12.15. It's over 2 hours of waiting without seating. I'm sitting on the floor for 2 hours. The plane is coming. On board we meet with happy and satisfied people. We are informed that the delay is due to crewet's rest. There is no stand by crew. For it is now everyone is settling their vacation. It is nice. We land and I rush to find a transfer service center. Arlanda has unfortunately no signs. I have gone wrong twice. There is absolutely no one who has been waiting for us or given us any information, it takes a long time before we understand we have to draw a number. But what should you press? The lady in the counter is alone and gets very angry that we are wrong. I get a new boarding card and a message that I will have to stay overnight. Now I have to go to the luggage hall and talk to the costumer service there. There is no costumer service there, just baggage help. The lady still giving me a sticker with reference to the hotel - 3 course dinner she says. I would like my baggage. Neeeej, I can not get that. I get totally desperate. Not even a tan brush. She gives me a bag. It will help. No, I do not want to scold out, she just says yes. Yes. Yes. I'm coming to the hotel, I'm told that dinner we can not get before 20.30. The hotel has more important guests. Kl. is 16.00. What's the matter with these people !! There I belong in addition to other passengers that they could get their luggage out without any problems. The following day we arrive in Oslo. I'm 20 hours late. When we leave the plane there is a friendly young man with a sign - transfer. They can do that enough in Oslo. I also notice the signs. Clear. All the way. The feeling that this was a well-organized demonstration is becoming increasingly evident. I understand. They want us to complain. We will do that of what I understood on my fellow passengers. But it will also have an opposite effect, I will not fly with SAS again. Only if I absolutely have no other choice. And that means fewer and fewer customers for the company, and that means there may be no job complaining to SAS employees. Fredag den 20 juli 2018 modtog jeg kl. 19.20 en sms fra SAS om at flyet dagen efter vil være 2 timer forsinket. Afgangen oprindeligt skulle være fra Split kl. 10.10, 21 juli 2018. Mellemlanding i Stockholm, så videre til Oslo. Ankomst 14.35. Det viser sig selvfølgelig at costumer service ved SAS lukker kl. 19, og åbner ikke før 9 dagen efter. Split lufthavn er en af de værste i verden. Ingen tvivl. Jeg bliver lovet at hvis jeg vil, så skal jeg få baggage ud i Stockholm. Afgangen bliver flyttet til 12.15. Det er over 2 timer med ventetid uden siddepladser. Jeg sidder på gulvet i 2 timer. Flyet kommer. Ombord mødes vi af glade og fornøjede folk. Vi bliver informeret at forsinkelsen skyldes at crewet skulle have sin hvile. Der findes ingen stand by crew. For det er nu alle afvikler sine ferie. Det er flot. Vi lander, og jeg skynder mig for at finde transfer service center. Arlanda har desværre ingen skilte. Jeg har gået forkert to gange. Der er absolut ingen som har ventet på os eller givet os nogen information, det tager lang tid før vi forstå vi skal trække et nummer. Men hvad skal man trykke på? Damen i skranken er alene, og bliver rigtig sur over at vi trykker forkert. Jeg får et nyt boarding kort og besked om at jeg bliver nødt til at overnatte. Nu skal jeg gå ned i baggagehallen og snakke med costumer service der. Der findes ikke nogen costumer service der, bare baggage hjælp. Damen der giver mig alligevel et klistermærke med henvisning til hotellet - 3-retters middag siger hun. Jeg vil gerne have min baggage. Neeeej det kan jeg slet ikke få. Jeg bliver helt desperat. Ikke engang en tanbørste. Hun giver mig en pose. Det vil hjælpe. Nej, det vil det ikke, jeg skælder ud, hun siger bare Ja. Ja. Ja. Jeg kommer til hotellet, der får jeg at vide at middagen kan vi ikke få før 20.30. Hotellet har vigtigere gæster. Kl. er 16.00. Hvad er der i vejen med de her folk!! Der hører jeg i tillæg fra andre passagerer at de kunne få sin baggage ud uden problemer. Dagen efter kommer vi til Oslo. Jeg er 20 timer forsinket. Når vi går ud af flyet står der en venlig ung mand med skilt - transfer. De kan det vist nok i Oslo. Jeg lægger også mærke til skiltene. Tydelige. Hele vejen. Følelsen af at dette var en velorganiseret demonstration bliver mere og mere tydelig. Jeg forstår det godt. De vil have os til at klage. Det kommer vi til at gøre, af det jeg forstod på mine medpassagerer. Men det vil også have modsat virkning, jeg kommer ikke til at flyve med SAS igen. Kun hvis jeg absolut ikke har noget andet valg. Og det betyder færre og færre kunder for selskabet, og det betyder at der måske ikke vil være noget job at klage over for de ansatte ved SAS.

Our flight from Stavanger to Bergen 4 days ago was delayed twice. When we finally arrived in Bergen, our luggage had not made it. The next day we left e-mail messages, no reply. We phoned and were kept on hold for 45 minutes, so we gave up. We tried the tracking system - it showed no activity. We finally decided go to the Bergen airport ourselves, and there, on the floor, was our luggage. Only 1 person was working at the desk, and she was unable alone to cope with the lost luggage complaints. Today, our flight from Stavanger to Oslo has been delayed twice. Other conference acquaintances of ours who were flying to Amsterdam said their flight was also delayed. We've been hearing stories of other SAS delays, leading us to wonder if punctual flights are the exception with SAS.

327,P Dawe,Hong Kong,2018-07-27,1,"London to Hong Kong via Stockholm. This is the second time we have flown this route in the past 3 years, overall the flight is actually pleasant. Minor complaints regarding the inability for families traveling with an infant to check in online and the terminal malfunctions in terminal 2 that where not really their fault, aside. The plane is comfortable, the route well planned out though very tight for any delays coming out of London and the seats very comfortable. The food is basic but good and the in-flight entertainment limited but sufficient for a single flight. I would love to leave the story here, unfortunately the experience fell apart following our arrival in Hong Kong. One of our baby car seats did not make either flight and was still in London. With no SAS representative in Hong Kong we were forced to deal with the baggage handler Jardine. When we asked how we are supposed to get home with no car seat the brisk reply was they don't know or care. Getting no where we proceeded onto the main desk to be told that the airline will not provide a spare car seat due to the potential liability if there was an accident the airline could be at fault. The solution provided was to hold our child in the car and take our chance. I am horrified to hear a representative of the airline suggest that the company cares more about possible liability than the safety of a child. This lack of any option forced us to take a very long and expensive train journey home with two very tired children at 8am on a Monday (otherwise known as rush hour). I understand that bags go missing (BA also lost a bag of ours on this same journey). however i expect the airline to take responsibility and provide a solution when you lose a safety device such as a car seat. To rub salt in the wound 4 days later we have still not received the car seat. Last we heard it missed the following days connecting flight to HK from arlanda and is currently still in Stockholm.

329,D Gassing,Norway,2018-07-23,2,"Oslo to Faro via Stockholm. Travelled in SAS Plus (European Business Class). The check in and priority boarding was great at Oslo Airport. However the lounges at both Oslo and Stockholm are overcrowded, and the food selection is at the best average. Too many big tables, too few toilets as there was a line the whole time inside the lounge to go. The only good thing is enough power outlets. The flight from Oslo to Stockholm was on a very cramped CRJ 900 - almost non existent leg room, and very poor roll with cream cheese. The flight was one hour late - no explanation or apology for this. The next 4 hour flight to Faro started boarding 10 minutes before departure, and hence got a delay of 30 minutes - again no explanation. On board they had a few selections for the economy passengers to choose from to buy, but in «business» class the only option was salmon salad. Even though it is in the same square boxes. Why dont they let business class decide between rhe options themselves first, and then sell the rest to economy. To the coffee they served some chocolate in some nice boxes. However when we took one of them and bit in we noticed mould on it. The mould was hidden under a hard chocolate shell, so impossible to notice on the outside. We told the crew and got one more box and same here.

331,Daniel Conway,United Kingdom,2018-07-14,2,"London to Tokyo via Copenhagen. What a nightmare this airline was! There was absolute chaos with them at Heathrow after they cancelled the flight to Copenhagen just one hour before it was due to depart (lack of crew and we actually saw the plane depart the airport with no passengers on!). Of course, this can happen with airlines but what was really the problem was the lack of knowledge and bad attitude of their staff ground and call centre staff. I received an SMS telling me the flight was cancelled and immediately went to the SAS transfer desk - a queue had already formed so I called the SAS call centre while waiting in the queue. To cut a long story short I had to make two phone calls and argue with three different SAS employees throughout the day in order to get onto a flight to Tokyo. SAS seems to have a very dysfunctional computer system and very little slack. In the end, I got onto an ANA flight 8 hours later. The return from Tokyo was late and I very nearly missed the connection back to London. And I am still waiting for my luggage to be returned 48 hours later! On board is OK - fairly basic food and no choice of food, but it was the chaotic scenes at Heathrow that would put me off flying with SAS again.

My route was TXL to TLL via ARN. Besides the fact that all four segments were late, I was mostly miffed about the idiotic way SAS now handles something as simple as serving a cup of water inflight. On three of the four segments water was served to every passenger who wanted some along with tea and coffee for no cost. Because SAS aspires to be a budget carrier they cater ALL flights with small bottles of water. However, flights less than 80 minutes are deemed too short to sell water at exorbitant prices so they serve it for free. The problem is they use many more plastic bottles than an airline would use if they had the normally-used big bottles. So much for SAS’ supposed concern for the environment, or for their passengers. Those who were served this “precious” water were given a ration of less than a small cup full and no refills. On the final segment I was told that the only way I could get some water at no charge would be if I stated that I needed it for taking medicine.

334,S Rasmussen,Macedonia,2018-07-10,1,"Vilnius to Copenhagen. The expected departure time for this flight was 15:00, however at 14:55 there was no evidence that this was going to happen. The monitor at the departure gate wrote ""New information at 15:00. Expected departure 15:00"". I don't know what this means in English, but fact is there was no SAS flight. No information was given. At 15:35 someone came up and annouced (only in Lithuanian) that the flight was delayed. I don't understand Lithuanian, so had no idea. I then asked a security worker in the airport about where the Information desk or Service Desk was located, only to be told that no such thing exists in Vilnius Airport. I would have to leave the departure zone, then come back. I decided to do just that, left departure zone and went straight to the SAS / Star Alliance office to ask what was going on about my flight to Copenhagen. The woman behind the desk then told me the flight was delayed, but that was all she knew. What an impressing service. I then tried to call SAS in Copenhagen only to learn that SAS customer service have no information about current flight operations. However, travelling on SAS Plus, I anticipated that I would have access to the business lounge in Vilnius Airport. This turned out to be untrue. As the only carrier in Star Alliance, only SAS business customers are not entitled entry to the business lounge even if SAS sell their business tickets with the understanding that you can access the business lounges. Finally boarded the flight two hours and 15 minutes after planned departure and got my seat in row 3 in the extremely cramped CRJ900 aircraft. Food served was actually OK, only later to see that deserts were one month over expiry date! Bottom line is that I fly SAS around 28-30 times per year, and even if they leased out the Vilnius-Copenhagen route to Air Nostrum and CityJet, it still states SAS on the airline ticket. Fact is, that I have had 6 cancellations and 5 major delays the past 7 months. SAS used to be a quality airline, and had a world known brand for service and punctuality, but how times have changed. To me SAS is now no better than low-cost airlines, and the quality and punctuality is long gone in the race towards being cheap which SAS is not. Other airlines in the Star Alliance are way better than SAS. Even flying SAS Plus is like flying cattle class.

337,Fredrik Westerdahl,Sweden,2018-07-02,7,"Stockholm to Newark via Copenhagen. I did not use the WIFI on this flight. There are mostly two things that set SAS down, Cabin crew and the IFE. Although on the flight down to CPH had amazing cabin crew, the one to EWR was less impressive.  The IFE was good/decent. It will probably keep you entertained for a flight this long. The IFE offers some movies (around 58 if i remember correct) and some TV shows (Around 1-5 episodes for each one) That and the non-interactive route map. Although it might keep you entertained for just over the atlantic, maybe not a super long haul flight like from Scandinavia to LAX. SAS offers the In flight magazine and the menu digitally. Now this is a part with takes the IFE on this flight down. The games. There was only Chess under the ""Games"" category but there is some more under ""Kids"" and ""Games"" like tetris or something.  The food selection for the cold part was good but a little bit overpriced although I do like that you can pay with Eurobounus Points on SAS so if you are a frequent flyer with them you can pay around (I think it was) 1,100 Eurobounus points. Although the cold food was food hot food can get a little bit bigger in selection in my opinion. You get a free meal and breakfast/pre-landing meal for free.

338,H Dansten,Germany,2018-06-30,2,"Stuttgart to Reykjavik via Copenhagen. The flight between Stuttgart and Copenhagen and return was on a small jet as expected and of a duration of slightly more than an hour. No problems with either flight. The primary flight from Copenhagen to Iceland was the problem. - both outbound and the return. Having never flown SAS, I'd previously thought of them as a reasonably good national carrier. My assumption was mistaken. My experience with SAS ranks them as a cut-rate discount airline, but one that doesn't advertise themselves as such or acknowledge they are. I know what to expect if flying a discount airline so I'd have no rights to complain for lack of services/amenities, it would be expected - but this does NOT apply to SAS, nor their pricing!  The 3 hour flight on the A320 to Keflavik had zero entertainment options, closely spaced rows, very narrow seats, and no more than a few degrees of ""recline"" - so the word really doesn't apply to these seats. No-charge amenities equaled exactly coffee, tea, and water. On the return flight we asked for a second cup of water (was give a max. of 200 ml in the first cup), but were informed we were ""allowed"" one cup and we'd need to pay €3 if we wanted more. Outward flight: aircrew arrived at gate 23 minutes prior to scheduled departure. The broadcast delay was blamed on ""lots of baggage"" which is a bogus explanation; the passenger and bag information is a ""known"" well before the flight.  They were simply late and must think all passengers are mindless cattle. In the future if this airline's rates are competitive with other ""discount"" airlines, now that I know what to expect, I might use them again. But if that is not the case and unless hundreds of $ are saved per ticket we will never fly SAS again!

That made me missing my connecting flight to La Réunion. No food /drink vouchers had been given even though the delay was more than 4 hours. Even the later flight left almost more than an hour late, also they had to reboot the wi-fi service to make it work. I had to look for an accommodation in urgency in Paris and on my own budget as I missed my connecting flight. I had to ask how can I have some reimbursement according to EU law, the only thing they could give me is a brochure about my rights.  And the top of the top : arriving to Paris, no luggage. It has stayed in Stockholm. And, of course, no ground staff at the moment given to handle customer complaints either. Nor any shops open to at least buy myself an exchange underwear until tomorrow (I will now arrive to my destination only two days after I left).

I was flying economy and was able to get an update at the gate for premium economy for a really good deal. The downside was that i have paid for my seat in economy and I didn't get any compensation for that. I have flown SAS before, in premium economy as well and I must say, the overall impression is the same. They don't excel in anything, I don't remember a part of the journey that made me say ""wow"" but also they aren't bad in anything. You get a relatively okayish experience for an okayish amount of money. The new things in premium economy this time were: free Wifi on board and the possibility of using the lounge at ARN. About the lounge in review separately. The inconvenience here was that making the upgrade at the gate, I had to go back through passport control, walk some good steps and then go back through passport and security control to get back to the gate. I ended up 15 minutes in the lounge. And also, I had to ask them at the gate if I was able to use the lounge, they didn't tell me when I did the upgrade. Because it was new, I had to see it. The seat I got was indeed huge, although not as comfortable as expected. I was alone on the whole row and the cabin, even with so many upgrades was still empty. The food was average, not what you would expect from a premium cabin and the service was in the same line. I couldn't log in automatically with my e-ticket number so I had to ask the crew to provide me a voucher in order to access the Wifi. It was unlimited, but I couldn't browse the internet, it worked just for social apps, so it was a nice plus, anyway. The seats had plugs for charging devices.

357,W Pearce,Netherlands,2018-05-12,10,"After reading several critical reviews I feared the worse. As a regular global business traveller I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly. Now for this trip I flew with my family in Economy cattle class, so expectations were not too high. Check-in was fine, paying for seats of choice should not be necessary, but overall was acceptable. Boarding was well organized, although I am still amazed by the chaotic management of the Newark Airport. Due to a technical failure with a previous El Al airplane at our gate, the SAS aircraft could not get to the gate. The Airport authorities misreported the delay was caused due late arrival of the SAS airplane, however we saw it landing 2 hours in advance, so no blame to SAS here. Then the flight itself, it was a very good stable journey, hardly any turbulence and when there was the pilot did his best to fly around. The seats were fine, I have seen much worse.

366,S Rasmussen,Lithuania,2018-03-05,1,"Copenhagen to Vilnius via Riga. SAS has delegated operation of the route between Copenhagen and Vilnius to Air Nostrum. Ever since that happened, there have never been so many delays and cancellations on this route, much to the irritation of frequent flyers like myself. This Friday was no exception. 5 minutes after boarding, the flight to Vilnius was cancelled, and all passengers were told to go to the Transfer Center in Copenhagen airport. I was then told I had been re-routed to Vilnius with AIr Baltic via Riga. I thought this was no big deal, however SAS refused me to get a Business Class seat with Air Baltic claiming ""the product you bought doesn't exist"". I then argued and asked how the product cannot exist when it clearly stated on my boarding card I was in business. I even provided the invoice stating my purchase in business. Bottom line is that SAS couldn't care less, and with their normal arrogant attitude I was sent onto Air Baltics old propeller machines in Economy Class, and eventually got to Vilnius with a 4 hour delay. All this is just not good enough. SAS has really turned into a low-cost airline, and at this time I have no confidence in this cheap airline. They sold me a product, and claimed it doesn't exist? Sorry, that is downright dumb. If SAS wants returning customers, they should really sharpen the pencil regarding customer service - in the airport as well as on board.

380,A Berner,Sweden,2017-12-28,6,"Stockholm to Manchester. Check in with SAS at Stockholm Terminal-5 was smooth and convenient  as well as the following security check. The fast-track access (available to Star Alliance gold and diamond members) is a very convenient and time saving benefit during the crowded afternoons. Boarding was taking place a bit late with the stressed cabin crew rushing and almost pushing everyone to take their assigned seat ASAP so we could depart on time. This kind of reception made you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome as a passenger. After all, it was not our fault that the boarding (and take-off) was behind schedule. The inflight menu is a bit limited and have very few options regarding warm meals/items but one things that annoys me a bit is the fact that all information on-board is printed in English only and not any of the Scandinavian languages (Swedish, Norwegian, Danish) as well. Although most Swedes and Scandinavians speak and understand good English there are always children and some senior citizens (like my grandparents) who don't speak, read, or understand it quite well wherefore bilingual information to all passengers would be a good idea. After all, this is supposed to be Scandinavian Airlines, not British Airways, United Airlines or that the airline carrier of any other English native speaking country. The positive thing is that the A320-neo is much more comfortable (and quieter) to travel in as a passenger than the aged B-737's that are slowly being phased out in SAS' current fleet. So overall, the flight was decent (but nothing special) as I arrived in Manchester a little later than scheduled. Punctuality is unfortunately not SAS' strong side these days as almost every single flight I take with them these days arrived a little late.

384,Peter Holford,United Kingdom,2017-11-28,3,"SAS appears to be devoid of any customer service skills. There is a very off-hand attitude that is rare even among some budget airlines that have a bad press. We arrived for our flight at Manchester Airport. We were informed the flight was delayed, the plane changed and our seat allocation unilaterally changed. We had booked seats with extra legroom at £17 extra per person. No apology given - just a shrug. We endured a cramped flight (we are all tall) with one of our party a fairly claustrophobic traveller - three hours of misery for her! On our return a letter to head office was totally ignored. A subsequent email elicited an automatic acknowledgement. Eighteen days later I received two emails stating that two tickets would be refunded £17 each. It also included the delightful sentence: ""System generated e-mail, please do not respond."" The email was impersonal - nobody named to respond to. I emailed (to the original address) about the third ticket - no response again. Two weeks later on checking my bank statement I found the third ticket had been credited. Utterly impersonal to the point of rudeness. No apology or explanation, no compensation beyond the minimum legal refund. An email then arrived with the heading ""Help us Improve"" and a link to a survey.

The transfer flight from Stockholm to Hong Kong was delayed from 2.30 to 5, then 5 to 7.40, then got cancelled altogether. The initial delay was informed through SMS, however, the subsequent delays and cancellation were not notified through any channel including SMS or email. Passengers were not updated until the very last min at the gate when they were actually lining up for boarding! 2We were told that the delay was caused by a lightning struck on the wing, and they were doing everything they can to get it back on the air within a couple hours. Unrealistic expectation! We saw nobody working on the plane which was parked right at the gate. If they were welding the hole as what we were told, shouldn’t that be performed in a hanger? It’s a Sunday, do you expect any Swede to work at all? Since we had access to the Lounge, we were told by the staff at gate to head to SAS Lounge located at the other end of the terminal; not only it’s incredibly far, we also had to go back out through passport control and security check again. Other passengers without lounge access were told to wait near the gate.  After sitting in the lounge for an hour or so, we went to the service centre (right below the lounge) to get an update. We took a ’fast’ ticket for Plus/Business and still waited 45 mins for anyone to assist us. There were no seats available nearby so everyone waiting were standing in front of the counter with luggages. At counter, staff told us that the flight was cancelled altogether.

397,Una Celma,Latvia,2017-08-31,2,"✅ Verified Review   This is a review of a non-flight and lying by SAS on August 30 that led to me, my husband and our son losing a day of our travel to the New York area. We were to fly with SAS from Riga to Stockholm and then on with SAS to Newark. As we arrived to drop our baggage, it was clear that the SAS flight scheduled for 11.10 had been pushed back to 1200 and we would not make the connection. We asked what could be done and the ground staff in Riga said that SAS was working on re-booking us. Then the flight was pushed back to 13.00. My husband called SAS and they said that if we flew with the delayed flight, something would be rebooked for us in Stockholm, possibly on a different airline and that if we had to stay overnight, SAS would either provide accommodation or reimburse us. They said if they rebooked us to JFK and we submitted a taxi receipt for transport to Newark where we had a rental car waiting, they would reimburse the cost. After a while, the gate agent where the delayed flight was supposed to depart said that we would be rerouted with Air Baltic to Rekyavik and then on with Icelandair to Newark arriving at 19.00, a reasonable time. As some of the passangers started getting their new boarding passes, the gate agent said that my husband and our son and I would be routed from Riga to Rekyavik then to Minneapolis then to Newark arriving after midnight. As we have to drive about an hour to our hotel, this was unacceptable and we were rebooked to a United Airlines flight the next day. The gate agent, speaking for SAS, said that we would not be offered accommodation by SAS or reimbursement for such since we had declined to take their ""USA by night"" tour through Minneapolis. I think that this offer was, in fact, part of a lie by SAS, since they led us to believe we would get to Newark direct from Rekyavik and should not have been surprised that we declined.

399,J Fox,Ireland,2017-08-24,6,"✅ Verified Review   Dublin via Stockholm-Arlanda to Helsinki and return as it was a cheaper option by €70 than the direct route out of DUB. First sector was beset by problems and delays. Firstly, upon an inspection of the aircraft there was a technical issue with the emergency lighting and passengers waited almost 30 Minutes on a staircase before information was relayed to them and were requested to return and wait at the gate seating area. Secondly, after boarding the captain informed us that due to the earlier issue we'd missed our slot and that there would be ATC restrictions. He also added that there was a computer malfunction at Dublin Airport and we had to wait until this was resolved. Eventually, we departed at 13:30 (scheduled departure time of 11:50). This gave us an exceedingly tight transfer time at ARN for the flight to HEL. Originally, we should have had two hours to make the transfer; this being significantly reduced. However, upon approach to Stockholm after the captain had informed us we'd be landing in 10 minutes, I noticed this timeframe had elapsed and were now circulating over the airport and city for a time. It turned out that the airport was temporarily shut due to a drone in the area. We eventually landed at 17:00 - 1.5 hours behind schedule. Fortunately, due to the drone incident our Helsinki flight was delayed to 18:30 which gave us ample time to make the connection. All other flights were uneventful and flights on the return sector left and arrived on time. I've flown with SAS on 6 flights in the last year and have found their attendants and pilots to be professional, welcoming and competent but their aircraft worn, dated and tired. All four flights were on Boeing 737-600/700 series aircraft which were 17, 13, 19 & 15 years in the fleet. Time for modernisation.

402,Herwig Lejsek,Iceland,2017-08-15,10,"✅ Verified Review   I booked a flight between Reykjavik and HongKong via Oslo and Stockholm and Shanghai to Gothenburg via Copenhagen. I was satisfied in my experience with SAS. The intra-nordic flights were all good experience. The new food concept of SAS PLUS is an improvement over the food that was before. Also the service with additional drink and snack offering has improved. Stockholm to HongKong suffered a 80 minute delay which almost made me to lose my onward connection to Singapore. Luckily I had already checked my luggage through, so the Singapore airline ground crew was aware and booked me on the next available flight.

409,P Larssen,Sweden,2017-07-12,6,"✅ Verified Review   What is the use of ""SAS Plus"" on European routes? Flew Stockholm to Lisbon and back in SAS Plus (former business). On SAS website there are a list of benefits when traveling in Plus. But what do you really get? On board: Seating: no difference at all from economy, except for being seated in the first rows. One benefit is supposed to be chosing your preferred seat when booking, but be prepared that they try to give you a another (worse) seat at the gate - happened to me on both legs. Food: a cold meal is included, OK quality when departing from Stockholm, worse on return leg. Drinks for free. Power outlet: should be available according to SAS website, but was not. At the airport Fast Track should be included - works brilliant in Stockholm but in Lisbon there was no sign of a fast track at all. Lounge access should be included - good lounge in Stockholm but in Lisbon there was no lounge at all admitting SAS Plus passengers. No information of the lack of fast track/lounge was given in advance. Check-in in advance: works fine in Stockholm, but not possible in Lisbon, only manual check in. (Separate SAS Plus check in counter, though.) Strange and confusing is that the booking is not possible to retrieve from the SAS App several hours before check in. What remains of the benefits of Plus is the possibility to rebook and cancel your ticket, more luggage and more eurobonus points.

412,Mia Susanna Krizo,United States,2017-07-04,1,"✅ Verified Review   Chicago to Stockholm. I flew to Stockholm from Chicago with my two children on July 02. At check-in we were given stand-by seats, and were told that we would be assigned seats at the gate, (which is something that has never happened in the 20+ years that I've flown with various airlines). I was concerned and asked if we would be seated together. The answer - ""I'm sure you will be."" We reached the gate and waited in another line (I wonder why SAS is stuck creating lines in the twenty-first century when there is no need for them) and were finally given our seats. I took a look at them, and noticed that one of my children was placed in another row. I asked to be seated next to both of my children, and was told that I had been given great seats, seats that I would normally have to have paid for. I said I didn't want better seats, I wanted to be seated next to my children. The person behind the desk said, ""I'll page you later."" He never did. On the plane I told the flight attendant that I really wanted and needed to be seated next to both of my children. Her answer - ""You have to pay extra if you want to be guaranteed a seat next to someone."" You read that right. In a SAS flight you have to pay extra to be seated next to your child. They appear to think it's acceptable for a child to spend 9 hours without being able to see or talk to his parent, a child who gets anxious during turbulence, and needs assistance with opening items during meals, and who wants to be close to his parent in an unfamiliar environment to feel safe. Luckily for us, a concerned passenger (who was appalled by the callous disregard of the flight attendant) switched seats with my son. Imagine that: a passenger has to do what the airline should have done without being asked. We provide the children's ages when booking the flight. The airline knows which passengers are children. This shouldn't be a problem. Another related problem was the quality of food. I was glad that I had packed food for my children, for it took the flight attendants nearly 2,5 hours to bring the evening meal and when it arrived, my children looked at the soggy, slimy vegetables and the overcooked meat and refused to eat it (so did I, btw). My advice to people is to think twice before booking a flight with SAS if they have children with them as nowhere do they mention that you have to pay to be seated next to your children, and as no sensible, feeling person would ever think that an airline would separate children from their parents it is something that parents can't prepare for. The eagerness of SAS to make money has reached a level of callousness that I believe is completely unmatched in the world of flying. As a native Swede, I find SAS to be an embarrassment and a disgrace. You can go after our money, but you can't go after our children to make that money.

413,I Pearson,United States,2017-07-04,7,"✅ Verified Review   Flew Chicago to Brussels via Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS did a solid job overall on this trip in both directions. The long-haul planes were clean and spacious, the short-haul ones, clean and cramped. Check in at O'Hare was fast and easy, check in at Brussels-Zaventem was chaotic. The crews were efficient and friendly (if not exactly engaged and charming, like those on, say, Aer Lingus). The seats were fine, and the entertainment system offered an interesting range of new and classic movies and shows. It was very nice to have some local offerings (subtitled). As for the food and beverages, they were so-so. There was only one meal option. And it did seem miserly and even a little embarrassing to offer only one complimentary non-alcoholic drink-and to repeat that fact several times over the intercom. Should we take up a collection to help the company stave off bankruptcy? Water, coffee, and tea were available free the entire flight, at least. All in all, SAS seems to be doing a halfway decent job of splitting the difference between its former higher-quality self and its cheapo, barbones Nordic rivals like WOW and Norwegian. I would definitely fly SAS economy to Copenhagen or Stockholm again if either were my final destination. I am not sure that I would do so on a connecting flight: the huge, slow lines facing transiting passengers for security and then again for immigration in both Copenhagen and Stockholm (jostling with masses of people for an hour just to *leave* the Schengen zone?) frustrated me to no end. If you are connecting through either of those airports, make sure that you have multiple hours (3+) in between your flights. Don't listen to the lucky people who landed when things were calm and breezed through the obstacle course. You never know how many flights will have landed the same time as yours. These airports are simply not equipped to deal with any more than a few passengers at a time.

I like SAS and that it feels like home when traveling, but this was not good. Firstly, the service onboard was great. All of the cabin crew was just as should be. However, the problem was the aircraft! One of the reasons I chose SAS was their new upgraded cabin in economy (wifi etc.), but the first aircraft from CPH-EWR was their spare aircraft because of technical difficulties on the original. It is annoying, but I would prefer to fly a plane that works even though having to give up on comfort. But one week after, on the return flight, I was once again (within one week) put on another spare aircraft. This seems very suspicious and completely unacceptable. For an 8-hour flight in a worn-down, old and grubby plane, this is far from the initial reason in choosing SAS. We did get Ipads, which was great, but it lacked the inflight information etc. that I love watching. I will use SAS on european flights, but I would not use them again on long-haul economy class.

422,S Rasmussen,Lithuania,2017-06-03,2,"✅ Verified Review  Today (2/6/2017) I flew what I thought was an SAS flight from Copenhagen to Vilnius. It turned out that the flight was operated by Air Nostrum. Before take-off, no safety instructions were given by the attendants. It was a recorded safety instruction in English language only. This is a Scandinavian airline, and while many people do understand English, some do not - especially elderly passengers. In my opinion it's just not good enough only to announce safety instructions in English only, well knowing that some passengers may not understand. After this, the cabin purser came on the PA with her introduction about the services provided through the flight, but in such bad English that I didn't understand anything they were talking about. Before take-off, none of the cabin staff checked through the aircraft if passengers had their seatbelts on. Before landing this was repeated. No attention was made to whether passengers had fastened seatbelts and/or put trays up. Bottom line in my opinion is that this airline simply don't care about safety. While this airline operates on behalf of SAS, they should begin taking safety seriously, and their cabin attendants just need to be able to talk better English.

One thing they don't do like other budget airlines is enforce cabin baggage limits - I saw people getting on with 2 or 3 decent sized bags and the compartments filled up quickly, leading to arguments between late passengers and the disinterested staff.

First I was upgraded for free from economy ""Go"" class to SAS Business, which really pleasantly surprised me. I have to state at this point that I am a Eurobonus Gold member, nevertheless it is uncommon to be upgraded two tiers at once. On board SAS Business I really appreciated the treatment by SAS flight attendants. They did an excellent job. Despite severe turbulence on the first half of the flight they managed to serve all passengers in a very welcoming way. They gave good recommendations and were very straight forward with me as a passenger. Of course Business class hard product is top-notch, so nothing to complain here as well.

433,L Tang,Hong Kong,2017-03-23,1,"✅ Verified Review   Hong Kong to Stockholm return. We flew SAS for 7 legs in March. Generally, the inland flights and short international flights (ARN-OSL) are fine. But Hong Kong to Stockholm was delayed for 3.5 hours, so that all connecting flights are re-routed and still we barely made it. The baggage didn't make it and was delayed for 16 hours. When we checked with ground staff in Tromso, they seemed to know nothing regarding the whereabouts of our baggage. They said we can wait 2 hours for the next flight and we did. Our baggage was not on the carousel and we checked with them again. Then after some walking around they said it will be on the plane the next day morning, but the delivery people won't pick it up before 4:30 pm the next day and we were given the choice of coming back to pick it up at our own cost. We ended up getting our baggage sent to our hotel at 6 pm. First off, the ground staff should allow more transfer time when re-routing our connecting flights. Second, I can't see, in this age how those people at Tromso not know where our baggage is and when it will arrive. Then on the inbound flight SK963 ARN-HKG, the captain said the cargo cabin door was broken after boarding is completed. Then for 3 hours, we were stuck on the plane with no food provided and no heat. Every 30 minutes, the captain updated with something like the technicians were still checking and he had no further info. At last, the damage needed to be fixed by someone from Airbus HQ in Toulouse and SAS is not attempting to switch us to another aircraft or re-route us at all. The flight was delayed for 24 hours. And if you have anything important to do, too bad, because you shouldn't have chosen SAS at all. The funny thing is, even though the flight was delayed for 24 hours, we still had to wait for them to load the containers after all passengers were boarded. About 30 minutes after the flight's scheduled time, the captain made an announcement again, saying the containers were loaded in the wrong order and had to be re-loaded again. All in all, SAS sounds like a joke. On SK963 and SK964, only 1 non-alcoholic drink is provided for free throughout the 10-hour flight. On shorter flights, only coffee, tea or water is provided for free. You may want to stock up on snacks before boarding.

436,J Musner,United States,2017-03-18,1,"✅ Verified Review   Stockholm to Zurich. Terrible experience checking into SAS today at Arlanda. I fly internationally often, many times through Stockholm. I have NEVER had an experience in ANY airport like I did today. Because I am flying from Stockholm, via Zurich (staying overnight) and into Washington DC, I was not able to check in on-line. I knew I needed to see a counter agent before I even got to the airport. I followed the signs to the correct check-in and presented my confirmation and Star Alliance gold card to the SAS agent who was at a mobile counter outside of the lines to see an agent. He immediately and very rudely told me I had to check in at the kiosks. I tried to tell him that I wouldn't be able to check in at the kiosks, but he was uninterested in my response and told me, ""that's what we do here."" Sure enough, I was not able to check in at the kiosk and went back asking to see his supervisor. He kept saying that he was a supervisor. In the meantime, I was so flustered, I thought I had lost my passport. I told him I wanted to speak to someone who was his supervisor or boss, but the person I finally talked to said he was at the same level as the person with whom I had the problems. The second supervisor I spoke with was someone nicer, but never apologized for the way in which I was treated.

There was an onboard menu, however I did not purchase anything as I felt the food and snacks were over priced. The flight time was around 3 hours 45 mins and there was no seatback or over-head entertainment screens. The flight landed in Copenhagen on time. One thing I really liked about SAS was that they knew if there were passengers who were connecting, before we arrived at the gate the FA’s announced gates for passengers who were connecting through Copenhagen. They informed us that our onward flight was at the gate and boarding would start in an hour. We proceeded through the terminal towards our gate. When we arrived at the gate there was a new system in place. Our boarding passes were scanned before going into an area of seating which was just for our flight. I was seated in 22B. The flight was full. On this flight there was only one tea and coffee service due to turbulence. We arrived on time and our baggage all made it in one piece.

I arrived to the airport in Zurich and I wanted to add a ski bag. They charged me 70 euros. I paid it and I asked if I can reserve in advance a ski bag for my flight back and pay 30 euros instead of 70 euros. They told me I have to do it online. I went online and it was not possible. So I called the customer service to reserve an additional bag 1 week before my flight. The customer service couldn't reserve because they told me there is a problem in the system and I have to do it in the airport.

(Although the TV msg failed to state that blankets cannot be used during take-off) then the dinner was bought with the wrong selection of meals (perhaps it was my English- but salad and scallops certainly do not sound the same!). Then the head purser brings milk instead of cappuccino (as requested twice), after all of these seemingly poor judgements is customer service the lady drives her cart into my feet knowing well that I was stood by the aisle seat on my way to the loo.

We left 10 minutes ahead of schedule thanks to the small size of the airport (only one flight at this time). The staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Our arrival was not delayed by any traffic congestion at OSL. What was not ok was the seating in the ex-business, now premium economy class, called SAS-Plus. The cabin had no curtain divider. The seats were the same in the whole cabin, which is not unusual in Europe, but the fact that they do not leave the middle one of the three seats on each side free as do other (better-rated) European national carriers led one to believe it might have been a waste to go SAS-Plus. The only difference in service is that you get your cold snack and drinks for free up front, but they are the same as in the back.

485,D Johnson,United Kingdom,2016-08-08,8,"✅ Verified Review   Oslo to Edinburgh booked in SAS Plus, or premier economy. Perhaps it is worth noting that SAS do not offer or sell Business class on Nordic, or international European flights. This was an early morning departure after a night-stop in OSL from an earlier TOS/OSL flight. Check-in was done using a machine the evening before. This was fine. Having no hold baggage there was no contact with SAS ground staff. The Fast Track security is offered as part of the SAS Plus deal. This eased the way through a very busy OSL departures area on a summer Monday morning. The flight departed from the F gates. To access the F gates you need to pass though the E gates and Passport Control. Travellers in SAS Plus have access to the SAS Lounge. Unfortunately there is no Lounge at the F gates and having gone though Passport Control there was no right of return to the Lounge in the E gates area. Boarding appeared efficient, announcements were made in Norwegian followed by English. SAS Plus offered 9 seats in total at the front of the B737-600. All other seating was for SAS Go. There is no seat difference at all except the bulkhead row did offer more leg room, this based on experience from an earlier flight in SAS Go. After an on time departure a light continental breakfast was served. Heated bread rolls, yogurt, a very small packet of muesli, juice and the usual coffee and tea. The tea/coffee cups used are really too small and flimsy. The Flight Attendants did however offer refills as they passed through the cabin. The aircraft arrival at the gate in EDI was 5 minutes ahead of schedule. That said the process for leaving the plane was subject to about a 10 minute delay cased by the lack of ground staff. SAS appear to contract Swissport as their EDI agents. From observation and the experience, there was not enough staff in attendance.

488,M Churchill,United States,2016-07-26,4,"✅ Verified Review   Split, Croatia to Washington, DC via Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark. SAS Arrival Services in Stockholm gave me the rudest treatment I've ever received by an airline. The flights were not bad, but the customer service experience in Stockholm was bad enough to make me think twice before flying this airline again. I did not know where to go when I arrived in Stockholm. I had a layover there overnight, and the signs were very confusing. I went to Arrival Services for help. When I got there, two people were receiving help at the counter, so I took the next number and stepped back to wait in line. As I waited, a large group of unhappy passengers missing baggage started to show up there, except they ignored the numbers and the line and went straight to the counter. I was upset, but I figured that the customer service folks would ask them to wait. Rather than tell them to take a number, however, they simply started serving the rude passengers. Trying to be polite, I waited, and waited and waited. After about 30 minutes had passed and roughly 30 other passengers had walked around me, I decided to be more assertive and approach the representative directly, who had stepped out from behind the counter. When she finished with her previous passenger, I looked her right in the eye and said hello, and started to ask for help. At that moment, another passenger (presumably Swedish, from the way she spoke) stepped around me and started speaking to the same representative. The rep turned to her and started helping her instead. Finally fed up, I interrupted them and asked for help. I stated that I had been next in line for 30 minutes, and I just had a simple question to ask. She said ""I'm working right now"", in a tone that indicated I was not worthy of her assistance. Not sure what I had done wrong (other than wait in the line they had askede to wait in), I interrupted again. I said ""My problem is simple, I don't have any lost baggage"". She replied ""I am speaking to this person right now"", indicating the girl that had stepped in front of me. Now completely annoyed for having been repeatedly ignored, I said ""she just stepped right in front of me!"", to which I received the response of a disgusted sigh and a dismissive wave of the hand. She turned away and helped the order passenger. I was floored by the rudeness. I walked away for 15 minutes, and came back. The other passengers were now gone. I walked directly to her and asked if it was finally a good time to offer me some help. She smiled at me as if we'd never met before, no apology, but it was one of those smiles that indicated she was really just hoping I would leave.

I was ignored, so I asked the second stewardess that I was not offered a sandwich (note I was watching when my fellow passengers were served). She gets me the sandwich without an apology and says, that will be SEK 35! I said to her; why do I have to pay when my two fellow passengers do not have to pay? She looks at me in a very arrogant way without a word and walks to her colleague. Apparently her colleague made a mistake by serving my fellow passengers in economy go class without charging it. Everybody can make a mistake but the arrogant attitude of the young lady working onboard is not acceptable.

539,John Safaev,Denmark,2016-02-08,1,"Copenhagen to Riga, and SAS Scandinavian is simply terrible. It says something about the airline when one can say that even Aeroflot is better at looking after their customers. SAS charged me extra for an overweight bag, which they didn't even deliver to the final location. While I was trying to locate any person to speak with who could help, the inhumane and terrible attitude of the employees to whom I had to speak to was out of this world. I never was spoken to so rudely by people to whom I'm paying money. Ultimately, the airline never refunded the overweight charge for the bag which they never delivered to the final destination - even after almost an hour an a half I spent sending someone to Kastrup so they could find anyone who could answer my questions and find where the bag was. I've never had a good experience flying SAS, but after this brazen and immoral act of theirs, I am sure I will never fly SAS.

It started off a bit weak as boarding was roughly 30 minutes delayed, and take off delayed by another 30 minutes. This, however, was because of some checked bags having to be off loaded due to the passengers never showing up, so I don't blame SAS for this. I was welcomed onboard by a friendly flight attendant who took my jacket and offered me a glass of champagne. I had the pleasure of flying on one of Scandinavians new A330 Enhanced and the seat was incredibly spacious and comfortable. Since I lack business experience I can't compare to anything but it was certainly satisfactory to me. We were offered a 3 course meal after take off and it was really good. The in-flight personal entertainment was excellent with a large screen and a good amount of movies and series to choose from. The seat could be made into a fully lie flat bed which was incredibly welcome as I have a hard time sleeping on normal flights. It also featured a massage function, which was nice. About two hours before we landed, we were offered breakfast, which was really good. There was a large assortment of included wares and although I did not really ask for much, it was still nice to see. My only real complaint is that I failed to connect to the wifi, even after numerous tries. But I had no pressing need for it and there was much else to do instead. All in all, it was definately the most comfortable flight I have had, complimented with a very friendly and professional staff.

Old plane, business class seat is the same as an economy seat and there was even a middle seat as well. Food and services were no better than Asian low cost airlines. I was on business in Zurich and on my return trip, I had to fly back to Vietnam from Zurich via Stockholm with SAS and then Thai Airways to Bangkok and Saigon. My reservation was with Thai Airways and the first problem - I found with SAS was that I could not check-in online even though I found my reservation on SAS website. I was shocked when I board the plane, I was assigned a middle seat in a row of 3 (B737), sitting next to me was two tall and broad build gentlemen. It was extremely tight and uncomfortable and the hot ambient temperature did not help. During take off, I was told (in a rude manner) to wear my jacket and could not even hold it in my laps. The crew did not offer to hang it for me. It was a two and half hour flight, and we were given food in a paper box - it was too uncomfortable to sit still leaving alone trying to eat a meal. One of the crew appeared to be quite pleasant which helped a bit but the rest were very unfriendly. This was the worst business class flight that I had ever flown in my 27 years of flying history.

587,K Vainionpaa,Finland,2015-08-07,9,"I flew this route twice during one month in SAS Plus. I have to say that for a traveller SAS makes flying as comfortable and seamless as possible it can get. Check-in using SAS app on iPhone was fast, got boarding passes with fast track (where available) and lounge access. Possibility to download digital magazines before flight is an innovative way. Priority boarding for both SAS/Star Alliance diamond and gold members and SAS Plus passengers. Welcoming and smiling crew at front door, clean cabin and comfortable economy seat. Overall service was very good, both purser and flight attendant took good care of us frequently serving drinks and snacks which are included. Crew was friendly and talked with every passenger in Plus. Cockpit crew announcements during flight were prompt and informative. Flights were on time. This is the way flying should be.

I had a middle seat in economy, which is normally a nightmare, but I could amazingly stretch my legs due to lots of legroom (I'm 1.85) and the inflight entertainment was top notch with large and sharp screens and a goid selection. Wifi available for a small sum and it worked really well throughout the flight. It was odd to be chatting with friends in the air but time passed quickly this way.

590,T Sahlen,Sweden,2015-07-26,4,"GOT-NCE and return. Chose SAS only for the nonstop flight. Overall, the flight was nothing to write home about. SAS charge you like a full-service carrier but offer low cost service. To me there is really no difference between SAS and Ryanair appart from the fact that SAS let's you check a bag for ""free"". Water, snacks, beverages (except coffee and tea) are priced rather heavily . Would advise anyone to buy it at the airport and bring it onboard. Flight attendants pleasant from GOT-NCE. On the return flight the crew consisted of the typical disinterested older ladies, one of which was downright rude. They hid in the galley for most of the trip. Seats were comfortable for a 2,5 hrs flight and the online check-in with mobile boaring passes worked really well. Both flights arrived on time. Due to previous experiences with SAS, I haven't flown them for quite some time. And I won't be for the near future either. Spend your money elsewhere.

The space was on par with most airlines, and I enjoyed having the selection of movies. However, I couldn't believe that they were charging for water and other beverages, snacks, etc. This was a Transatlantic flight and I was completely horrified when the flight attendant told me that only coffee or tea was ""free."" These two beverages are very dehydrating, and every flight I've ever been on always provides the flyer with water free of charge. The flight attendants were very unfriendly as well.

I am handicapped and it was a very difficult climb. My husband went to the baggage handler to retrieve my electric scooter. I asked another baggage handler where the lift/elevator to the airport was located. His reply was ""you are not handicapped"", I explained that I was, indeed, handicapped and unable to walk a distance. He refused to assist my husband to carry the electric scooter up the steep stairs into the Copenhagen airport! My husband had to lift it by himself and I had to slowly climb the steps in to the airport before I could drive my scooter.

593,Jeff Robinson,United States,2015-07-20,2,"We flew round trip coach from San Francisco to Copenhagen and bought our tickets 7 months in advance for $1,450 each. There were 12 of us flying under 3 separate reservations. Customer service over the phone was marginal depending on who you got, sometimes they were friendly, other times either too busy to care or rude. Check in was fast, friendly and efficient. Mechanical issues prevented us from boarding the plane and we were four hours delayed from departure. There was a mild apology given by the captain but not any discounts nor free drinks on the flight. Our plane seemed dated but was clean. Individual entertainment systems on the back of each seat are the worst I’ve experienced. Only a third of the published opportunities worked and the movies are on a loop with no pause nor start. Audio was terrible. Food quality was far less than average. The flight was smooth and we arrived at our destination safely. Return: Pre-flight online check-in was easier for our group. At the Copenhagen terminal once inside, it was not easy to understand what line to enter to begin your process as their signage could be improved. Boarding was efficient and on time. This plane appeared to be even older than the first one. I believe it was an Airbus A340? Entertainment systems and screen illumination were even worse than our first flight! Food was awful. But on the other side the service was good (if that even helps). A very long flight of almost 11 hours, all during daylight.

Well it certainly felt like it when travelling 'Plus' class with SAS from Heathrow T2 to Copenhagen T3 on a Thursday afternoon. Although the passenger enjoys certain advantages in 'Plus' this is lost during the actual journey.

597,Lira Lugay,United States,2015-07-01,1,"The service for wheelchair assisted passengers is horrible. After checking in, they had us wait for hours. They kept saying they had called for assistance but nobody came. We decided to start walking slowly to our gate. We saw an airport employee who had a wheelchair so we begged her to let my mother use the wheelchair. She was kind enough to assist. Another issue was choosing a seat. I made sure I purchased our seat from the Scandinavian Airlines website. Upon booking, there was no option to choose a seat even with an additional fee which we were willing to pay. I went ahead and booked our flight and called the airline. They advised me to check in early and request the seat upon check-in. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 11.30pm and as early as 5pm we had checked in our baggage. At the check in counter, I inquired again about requesting an aisle seat, but they told me they could not do it and I had to request it at the gate. We were sitting at the gate hours before they opened and when I spoke to two SAS employees, they told me I could not change seats. It's is ridiculous that there is no way to make this simple request.
