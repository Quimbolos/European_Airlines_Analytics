0,C Marten,United Arab Emirates,2023-11-15,1,"Horrible service, I wouldn’t repeat to take this airline even if it is free. 2 days before our flight they moved it 14 hours later. Our hotel and tours were already set up and we have to cancel the tour and get charged by the hotel for a day. In order to check in early, you need to purchase seats so we did because as per their website it says that they will not accept mobile boarding form. Boarding is not organized, no zones, no priorities so anyone can just go which makes it also difficult to board. Some of the staff are rude and they treat people like they are on the streets and not in the customer service industry. I understood that this is a budget airline but treating people like this is not acceptable. One of the flight attendants on our flight during boarding we reached our seat and were putting up our luggage so some of the passengers were waiting behind us instead of helping us at least to put up the luggage he was shouting and swerving us with his hand to the side telling us “let them pass!, let them pass!”, no manners at all, like really!?. It is not my first time to fly with budget airlines but this by far the most horrible I have experienced! So before taking this airline think first about it. It is cheap yes, but there are extra fees and weird requirements like printing the boarding card to be shown at the airport instead of flight ticket and mind you if you choose airport check-in there is payment also.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Bishkek,November 2023,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,2,no,True,Abu Dhabi,Bishkek,,Positive,0.9337,  horrible service repeat take free 2 day move 14 hour later hotel tour already set cancel tour get charge hotel day order check early need purchase seat per website say accept mobile board form board organize zone priority anyone go make difficult board staff rude treat people like street customer service industry understand budget treat people like acceptable one attendant board reach seat put luggage passenger wait behind us instead help us least put luggage shout swerve us hand side tell us let pass let pas manner like really first time fly budget airline far horrible experienced take think first cheap yes extra fee weird requirement like print board card show airport instead ticket mind choose airport payment

Their answer was ""They have air priority"", despite them knowing these passengers were coming in from the same line I came in, not the Priority lane.

6,Katja Horstmann,Germany,2023-11-06,1,"This airline is an absolute fraud! We had booked a flight with them last summer, only to have our flights cancelled last minute. We were already travelling in another country and were in Venice in summer - not a cheap place to be stranded. We called their Customer Support and were told that we'd be put on the next available flight IN 4 DAYS. We were told that ALL expenses would be paid (as they have to by law) - we clarified several times on this phone call if there was a limit and she said no, as long as not 5* accommodation. Fair enough, so we paid everything out of pocket for 4 days and send the receipts to Wizz Air afterwards. This company has been refusing to pay up and only reimbursed us about 20% of our costs - they deem 336 EUR for 2 people for 4,5 extra days in Venice reasonable. That is 42 EUR per person, per day. In Venice. In summer. For accommodation, food and transportation. We have reached out multiple times requesting to be paid the remaining expenses we incurred due to their flight cancellation AND HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER. They say to go through the ODR, which we did - they had 3 months to respond and never did. Please listen to the original call that was made with your customer support and pay up as you had said you would.

7,Philip Kennington,Australia,2023-11-01,1,"I flew Wizz Air from Suceava to Luton three months ago. My baggage, along with around 20 other passengers was not loaded onto the plane. We arrived in Luton and mobbed the arrivals carousel and eventually a wizzair person arrived and said that the pilot was supposed to tell us that our baggage wasn't here. Obviously, he hadn't done that. The poor ground handler did not explain the importance of a PIR (Property Irregularity Form) and that it had to be filled out at the airport terminal. The website does not explain that properly. Of course, that form is not available online and has to be filled out at the airport of arrival. i had to stay two extra days in London (with all of the costs incurred) and I live in Australia and of course Wizz Air does not fly to here. Two days later, I went in a taxi back to Luton Airport to collect my delayed baggage. The ground handlers did not explain the need for a PIR and I flew back to Australia.

9,P Garten,United Kingdom,2023-10-25,6,"The flight and check in went well. I paid for the auto check in service and was given seat 15a at the window. If I had known that the seat would have a painful lack of cushioning and that my knees would be pressed into the seat in front I would have paid the £26 for an extra legroom seat. I didn't have that issue with the seat inbound so I suspect it is the window seat plus a broken seat that caused my difficult journey. The flight was full so there was no opportunity to swap seats so I didn't complain about the seat to the flight attendants. As the two people on the outer seats fell asleep almost immediately (and I didn't want to wake them up) I put up with it. I wonder what if anything the FA would do. The service was friendly and helpful from what I have seen. For example, one woman had a large rolling bag that was too wide for the overhead, he assisted her to reduce its shape by using the zipper.

11,P Deane,United Kingdom,2023-10-21,9,"My first encounter with wizzair was with the iPhone app. It is solid, provides many services ancillary to the flight - such as history of flight landing - and allows you to book extra service after the booking. The booking process via the iPhone app was smooth. The charges are transparent, though I don't like how high the bag cost is, so I can compare it with the competition. I generally go with an underseat bag now, whether Ryanair or Wizzair; Aer Lingus alone gives you checked bag included in the low cost seat. Wizzair advised me to turn up 3 hours before departure due to security queue, and I am glad I did as it was a slow process of handling thousands with only 60% x-ray machine operating. We boarded 40 minutes before departure, but took off an hour later. The seats are the most limited in knee room of any of the LCC and this early boarding accentuated this - can you tell I am 6ft? The £10 charge for keeping the booking seats together leads to friends reuniting in the interval before takeoff. I was asked to swap by an attendant to a worse seat which I refused, later I was offered free extra legroom seat. The teens who had paid for these seats weren't allowed to occupy them.

The flight was delayed by a whopping 5 hours, departing at 2:15 am instead of the scheduled 9:15 pm, with a pitiful EUR 4 compensation offered. When all the shops closed at 11:00pm no Wizz Air staff were in sight to provide any food or water. What's worse, there was zero communication from Wizz Air throughout this ordeal. The staff, from check-in to the gate, were not only unhelpful but also incredibly rude when passengers sought information about the delays. No updates were provided about the reasons for the delays or when the flight would actually take off. Wizz Air's treatment of passengers during this experience was shameful.

70,S Daylin,Bulgaria,2023-07-30,1,"I am deeply disappointed and concerned about the way I was treated by Wizz Air in regard to flight W64326, 27th July 2023, Eindhoven to Sofia. I have confirmed booking Wizz Go, with pre-paid and reserved seat, priority check-in at the airport and free airport check-in – 50’ before departure at Eindhoven Airport. I was not informed that the flight is overbooked, not asked if I would volunteer, no that I would be denied boarding by any means. The online check-in app was not working for whatever reason. I was at the check-in desk at 2 hours before departure, I got a boarding pass and dropped off my baggage. I was at the gate 30' before departure, it was obvious that the flight would be delayed, but there was no information in any way about new departure time and overbooking. The gate service did not asked me if I would volunteer, nor that I would be denied boarding. The flight was delayed more than 1 hour, when I was at the gate checking my boarding pass for boarding I was just ordered to step away and not allowed boarding without any explanation. When I insisted for information what was happening, the ground service girl just told me that Wizz Air had overbooked the flight and somebody else had taken my seat. I was ordered leave the gate and go to complain to Wizz Air. I was given no information what I have to do, where to go, what were my rights, just behaving rude and arrogant, ignoring. The way Wizz Air and gate service treated me put me on high emotional and physical stress, messed up my personal and working plans. I do not care about Wizz Air overbooking practice – it is a bad business practice, it is Wizz Air corporate decision, but I will take care about that for myself. I am much concerned and affected by the services not provided, thought paid, the “denied boarding” rules (if any) and the way ground staff gate service treat such cases – unprofessional, no basic skills about customer service - rude and arrogant.

91,R Barkim,United Arab Emirates,2023-07-16,2,"Yesterday, we encountered a distressing situation with Wizz Air. My sister and I were traveling from Abu Dhabi to Antalya on an early Saturday morning. We each had one free carry-on bag, which we placed under our seats. After checking in, we proceeded to gate 17 for departure. However at the departure gate, we were informed that the flight's cabin baggage capacity was full, and they asked us to leave our carry-on bags there. They gave us tags and assured us we could collect our bags from the airport belt later. Since we only had our carry-on bags with us, my sister and I had packed everything essential, including clothes, undergarments, makeup, toiletries, footwear, and my tablet in those bags. Upon arriving at Antalya Airport, we were dismayed to find that our bags were not on the belt. We immediately filed a complaint, but the response from the complain center was that our bags were still in Abu Dhabi; they hadn't been loaded onto the plane. Now, my sister and I are left with only our small cross bags, containing just our passports and money. We have nothing else to wear or use. Our plan was to continue from Antalya to Trabzon, but without our bags, that seem to be impossible.

They offered to “negotiate” the cancellation cost of the ticket if we can provide doctor’s records resulting that my wife cannot travel, this is outrageous as medical records are confidential.

111,R Mears,United Kingdom,2023-06-19,1,"As a frequent traveler who has experienced countless flights with various airlines, I feel compelled to share my recent nightmarish encounter with Wizz Air. This scathing review serves as a warning to fellow travelers who value their time, money, and overall peace of mind. Brace yourself for a tale of incompetence, broken promises, and an utter lack of customer care. Let's begin with the initial offense: the cancellation of our flight without any plausible reason. We got an email the morning of our departure so we rushed to the airport to get some clarity only to be informed that your flight has been abruptly scrapped. Shockingly, Wizz Air failed to provide any legitimate explanation for this cancellation, leaving passengers bewildered and stranded without any clue as to what transpired behind the scenes. Additionally, they didn't have an option for both me and my partner to fly out until 3 days later which wouldn't work because of our work schedules. In a desperate bid for assistance, I reached out to Wizz Air's customer service while at the Palma airport. Little did I know that I was about to embark on an infuriating journey of unhelpful agents and contradictory statements. Despite assuring us that we would be reimbursed if we chose to book an alternative flight outside their company, this turned out to be nothing more than a hollow promise. They had no intention of honoring their commitment, leaving us in a state of financial uncertainty and deep disappointment. Refusing to give up, we sought professional help from an external company, hoping they could navigate the treacherous waters of Wizz Air's reimbursement process. Unfortunately, this only added insult to injury. Nine long and arduous months later, we are still fighting for the reimbursement we rightfully deserve. It is inconceivable that an airline, claiming to value its customers, could display such a blatant disregard for their responsibilities. Wizz Air's inability to provide a backup flight for three days highlights their lack of contingency planning and their disregard for the inconvenience caused to their passengers. Furthermore, their callousness in denying our rightful claim and subsequent inability to fulfill their obligations demonstrates a disturbing level of unprofessionalism and an alarming lack of transparency. Traveling should be an enjoyable and stress-free experience, yet Wizz Air has turned it into a nightmare. Their cancellation without reason, broken promises, and refusal to reimburse the amount we paid for an alternative flight have left us feeling betrayed and disillusioned. It is my sincere hope that this review will serve as a cautionary tale to potential passengers considering Wizz Air, urging them to explore alternative options and spare themselves the agony we endured. In conclusion, I strongly advise against choosing Wizz Air for your travel needs. Their lack of accountability, unreliable service, and poor customer care make them an airline that should be avoided at all costs.

112,S Hauten,United Kingdom,2023-06-19,1,"So, upon arriving 3 hours prior to my flight, it was already delayed by 2 hours.  But it was then moved again another hour, then cancelled. We were told to go to the flight desk, with many other wizz air flights. But at the flight help desk, there was no-one there. No member of staff knew what was going on. We then got told to go to gate 12. So did other flights to different locations.  Not blaming the staff, they had no idea what was going on just like us. No customer service, no information as to why it was all cancelled. As flights to Spain from Wizz still went ahead but Portugal and other Spain flights (from other customers) were cancelled? So what was it? I still don't know.

114,S Gieler,Israel,2023-06-17,3,"I think it's misleading to call this a low-fare. It was nothing but. The first indication of a campy ticket was when booking the tickets for two families I added one large (20kg) suitcase to each family. to my surprise, the cost of adding the luggage was per leg and stood at a whopping $130 per leg, per suitcase. In total, I paid $270 for the suitcase. For comparison, the ticket was $162. Additionally, the advertised ticket price changed while I was in the middle of the booking process and jumped by $20 per passenger. So a projected $140 ticket (already pricey for a 37min. flight!) actually climbed to $252 (in a family of 3). This didn't include advanced check in cost, seat selection cost, and other money grabbing options. But the real shocker was upon return. We got to the ticket counter and expected to drop our luggage and get our boarding passes when we were informed unceremoniously that we needed to pay another 50 Euro per person to be checked in. This happened despite the fact that no such fees were asked for on the way from TLV to Larnaca. The ground team threatened to deny our boarding unless we paid. The confirmation email btw only mentioned that ""If possible, always check in online before leaving for the airport. Otherwise, you might have to pay a fee at the airport."" - no clear language there whatsoever. Nothing in red, no advanced warning via email or sms. only an automated response from the check in rep. The supervisor wasn't offering any help either. We had to run to the other side of the terminal, pay the fees, then run all the way to the gate (threatened with a closed gate) only to be left waiting for the bus to the plane another 20 minutes in a small hall with no AC. Finally, a 20min. delay while on the plane is almost always complementary. The final ticket price then jumped to a little over $300, a truly low-low-fare experience for the price of a full-fare flight. I'd say that unless you're traveling alone, with a small backpack, and have all the time in the world, avoid this company at all cost.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TeAviv to Larnaca,June 2023,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,,2,no,True,TeAviv,Larnaca,,Negative,-0.8472,  think mislead call nothing first indication campy ticket book ticket two family add one large 20kg suitcase family surprise cost add luggage per leg stand whop 130 per leg per suitcase total pay 270 suitcase comparison ticket 162 additionally advertised ticket price change middle booking process jump 20 per passenger project 140 ticket already pricey 37min actually climb 252 family 3 include advance check cost seat selection cost money grab option real shocker upon return get ticket counter expect drop luggage get boarding pass inform unceremoniously need pay another 50 euro per person check happen despite fact fee ask way tlv larnaca ground team threaten deny boarding unless pay confirmation email btw mention possible always check online leave airport otherwise might pay fee airport clear language whatsoever nothing red advance warn via email sm automate response check rep supervisor offering help either run side terminal pay fee run way gate threaten closed gate leave wait bus another 20 minute small hall ac finally 20min delay almost always complementary final ticket price jump little 300 truly experience price say unless travel alone small backpack time world avoid company cost

Which meant the rest of us with priority were left wondering if we should do the same? Chances are half of us had priority and it would feel fair to cut in line because of that. When I asked about where priority was supposed to have been as I was boarding, the lady just shrugged with an exasperated look. It was the most clown show boarding I’ve ever seen.

During the flight it was very uncomfortable and very hot, no air-conditioning inside the plane. The second time, I checked in early online and bought a seat beside the window but when I got in the plane the crew said I can seat in any free seat.

145,W Hawkins,Australia,2023-04-24,1,"This is the single worst experience with an airline I have ever had. Everything about this was just insane. Promises of 'budget Friendly' were just the start. Me and my partner flew from Athens to Gatwick, £300 with cabin overhead baggage not included? (We are from Australia where this is standard for all airlines) If the tickets were actually budget I would understand. We arrived at Athens airport to find our flight delayed 2 hours. Ok, it's bad having your flight delayed but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since this happens to a lot of airlines. We looked up the aircraft info to find that there was no previous flight. As we waited at the airport we had 5 or 6 different times given to us by Wizz. Once the gate finally opened we made our way. We sat on the ground since seating was not available. Once we were ok to board we were put onto a bus to go to the plane. Once we arrived the driver opened the doors, told us ""don't exit yet"" and so we were left on the bus (packed in very tightly, there are no seats) for 15-20 minutes as we watched the cabin crew cleaning the plane through the windows. Why drive us out if the aircraft is not ready? And the plane has not had a previous flight AND was delayed 2 hours, the plane should have been prepared already? Once we finally got off the bus we were met by what I would find out to be some of the rudest hosts on a plane I have ever met. Every 5 seconds over the PA ""please do not block the aisles to avoid further delays"" to me seemed a bit rich after our experience so far. Also people are boarding, we aren't going to be seated in 3 seconds? When we sat, the aircraft was in a disgustingly awful state. Crumbs are everywhere, rubbish was left in the seat pockets. This aircraft was sitting here at the airport for a long time and the crew had done an abysmal job at preparing for passengers. The flight itself, once we got into the air was ok. Nothing special (they like to push their 'duty free' items on you for purchase, however I found that I could buy most of this stuff at Tesco for half the price). We landed at Gatwick and this is where the true torture began. Passengers stood to collect their luggage. As we were departing, the host grabbed the PA, stared directly into passengers eyes with the most disgusting look I have ever seen from flight crew ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" this was met with passengers fuming, how are we meant to get our luggage down then? He repeated it as I walked towards the front door of the aircraft ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" he proceeded to put down the microphone then step in front of me, put his finger to my face and said ""WAIT"" passengers piled behind me after this man had just told us not to block the aisles. He put his finger down ""ok go"". Me and my partner were livid.

So we had to run to another terminal to pay - at which time there was 5 minutes left before the flight. When we asked how to get to the terminal, it was listed at the other terminal (3) (which was a good distance away) but the Wizz Air employee told us it was terminal 4. There were other customers from all over the world (Irish, Portuguese) who had the same problem. At this stage in the game I insisted they show us where we should go. But of course, we had to go through security - where they (temporarily) lost our passports! Honestly, I was afraid of having a heart attack.

187,Mihaea Grigore,Spain,2023-01-12,1,"The experience with this Wizz Flex option is like walking on the street in broad daylight, someone sneaks up on your from behind, extracts 200 Eur from your pocket and walks away. Now the long story: I specifically bought a return flight with Wizz Flex option, in total amount of 260 Eur (212 Eur the actual flight fare and the rest in fees). So I would expect (after reading the Terms & Conditions of Wizz Flex), in the eventuality of asking for refund, to be entitled to 212 Eur back. I postponed the flight once. During this process, the Wizz Air website shows you available dates and after you select the new dates, it computes the price for the new flight and shows you only if there is a difference in price in their favour (if you have to pay something extra or not). I did this, nothing extra to pay, all good here. Later it became clear I will not be able to travel at all, so I went for the second benefit of the Wizz Flex, cancelling and getting a full refund. Surprise: Wizz Air congratulates me for being eligible for a full refund: 40 Eur! At this point I spend more money to call them (the only way to contact is by phone, charge with 1.2 Eur per min), to find out that when I postponed the flight, my refund value was automatically changed to the value of the flight from those new dates. A value which was not even displayed to me during this process. Again, during flight change, Wizz Air computes the value of the new flight and only shows you if you have to pay more for the new dates. It purposely does not warn you that not only you don't have to pay more, but that you are exchanging tickets worth 260 Eur to tickets worth 40 Eur and that this will affect your refund value too. Besides this practice being so obviously mean to trick you, is this even legal? To make a parallel, it is not legal to run an online shop that shows products you can buy, to charge your customers and to not show them the price they will be charged with.

Great we had about 2hours to sort this either rescheduling or finding another flight as our airport is about 2hours away. We ended up using Ryanair from Stansted which is 2 1/2 hours away. They got us there almost on time, on way home we were delayed over 4 hrs but Ryanair gave us compensation and it was handled very quickly can't complain so for that thanks Ryanair will use you again in the future. So we submitted our claim with Wizz on the 4-10-2022 we got a response on the 29-10-2022 to say they are looking into the claim. On the 29-11 they said that our claim has gone through and we will receive our monies 14 - 20 work days as we opted to have the money instead of the Wizz credits. We still have not received our refund well over the 20 workdays have emailed them still waiting to here back 8 days have passed.

190,K Shah,United Kingdom,2022-12-23,1,"Appalling customer service, or non-existent customer service should I say!! My friend and I have had problem after problem since we booked flights with them back in Sep 2022. They cancelled our outbound flight to Reykjavik without explanation, and there was no alternative with Wizz Air for the same day we wanted so we cancelled that flight with them and ended up paying more for another airline to fly on same date! They still haven't acknowledged or responded to our requests, let alone refunded the flight fare yet! It’s been 3 months. On a separate return flight with Wizz Air (that shockingly wasn’t cancelled), online check-in did not work - with a message of internal error appearing on the online portal. 3 times I tried to check in online with the same issue recurring, so I had no choice but to leave it there. At the airport, the desk staff made us pay airport check-in fees of 45Euros per person, which is outrageous in itself, despite us explaining the online error we faced, and then said you can contact Wizz Air customer service later to claim this back/ask them to waive fee. Absolutely ridiculous. There is not a Wizz Air representative present at the airport, as all their desk staff is outsourced so trying to have any matters sorted on the day is futile as these staff members have no authority to make decisions. To make matters worse, one of the in-flight crew members were also extremely rude. I was travelling with a friend who became injured during our trip and needed accessibility assistance; the crew member failed to communicate how she would be supported upon landing to get off the aircraft, and became very rude and impatient in her responses, when we asked legitimate questions after landing. We waited until all passengers had left the aircraft, and only then approached them to find out what was going on but we were just sharply told to “Wait!” without any clarification about what help will be offered. It is disgusting that they would treat a vulnerable customer with so much disrespect, and do so little to reassure them. We have been contacting them for months since our initial booking, but have not had any response or any positive action taken to resolve matters via email and through their contact form online. It is almost impossible to get hold of them. They simply don't care, and just want people's money. It seems it is not only their customers they treat so poorly since I spoke to a crew member on the flight, who also moaned that they have received many complaints and even as a staff member, she wasn’t even offered a flight with them to visit her family members who were unwell or easily given time off. It’s clear they are stone cold as a company, and care about nothing but profits. There are so many negative and worrying articles about them in the media. Still, they don’t act on customer complaints in a timely manner. I rarely waste my time and energy on writing bad reviews, but Wizz Air have been so poor with their customer service and strike me as a very unethical company given the countless bad reviews and comments I see online everywhere, that I feel compelled to write my experience also. I would not even give them a single Star but unfortunately you have to click on one to post a review!! I am fuming and will never be using this airline again.

220,P Jackson,United Kingdom,2022-10-14,1,"Booking was fairly easy and seemed a reasonable price. We only took hand luggage which worked well. Outbound flight to Podgorica went ok with a small delay and staff seemed fairly friendly. However, on our return flight we got delayed 5 times at the airport before being completely cancelled with no reason given. I had no mobile service and the airport had no wifi available for public use. I therefore asked airport staff for help who said they were unable to help and to contact Wizz directly. I eventually managed to get Wizz on the phone who offered me a refund for my cancelled flight but no further assistance. I therefore had to go around asking people to hotspot their mobile data so I could organise alternate flights, hotels etc. Because Podgorica is a small airport we had to travel to Dubrovnik, Croatia to get home. I have since sent a claim to Wizz, the claim was sent over 30 days ago and their website clearly states ""normally dealt within 7 days, certainly within 30 days"" - well that obviously is not true. I have tried contacting Wizz in other ways but they literally make it impossible with every member of staff saying they are unable to assist and unsure what to do.

Which I did and the reply was that ""I should have read your terms and conditions and have completed the online check in, as per your terms and conditions"".

Almost all the flights which I’ve been on were delayed, sometimes up to 3 hours. The personnel were not helpful at all, every time lying about the time. Or if you ask questions, about complaining they avoid to answer. I start feeling that they fly between the serious companies, which really respect their customers and do everything for their flights to be on time. Last experience was the last one for me choosing this unprofessional company, which have interest only for taking your money, after that you don’t matter for them. Because a redirected flight, I lost my connection to my final destination, I lost my rental car, and my hotel and I had to book a hotel in the new destination and a new flight for the next day for my final destination and another rental car. Besides that they kept us waiting in the new destination airport (which was not the plan)like sheep, while everyone asked questions about what’s happening. No one knew anything, so I get frustrated. All this coming after another flight with Wizz Air where my flight was delayed 3 hours just the day before. And the last one was when I come back after the long story.

249,A Marsha,Norway,2022-08-27,1,"My journey as a family of 2 adults and 2 children was to travel from Bergen to Tenerife through Wizzair and LOT airlines in this sequence. As I didn’t find any available direct flights to Tenerife by the time of booking the tickets in April 2022. First, I booked a flight for 4 passengers from Bergen to Gdansk  with WizzAi, which is canceled by Wizzair after the planned departure time). I have booked one night in a hotel in Gdansk on 25/06/2022. Bought 4 tickets for the whole family with LOT Airlines from Gdansk to Warsaw in order to take another aircraft to Tenerife. Booked another 4 tickets from Warsaw to Tenerife through Wizz Air at the end. On the planned day we went to Bergen Airport. The departure time was at 14.05. We received a sms from Wizz Air  the flight is delayed and the estimated departure will be: 14.40, then another sms at 14.27 that the flight was delayed again and the new departure will be at 16.00, then another sms about a new delay to 16.30. At 14.47 they sent sms that the flight was canceled without mentioning the reason for cancellation. No one from WizzAir was in the airport to inform us what to do and no one called us. We went home with our kids again and tried to contact Wizz Air. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone with a paid phone call, they said that there are no other available flights, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried on my own to find another solution, and I found a flight at 22.40 to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car and drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife on the second day. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured me that everything is OK. I got the same confirmation number, I rented a car and paid online from Katowice Airport to drive with my family over the night to Warsaw as we did not find a hotel to accommodate us. We went to Bergen Airport again with our kids. The new boarding was at 22.40 on Saturday 25/06/2022, but they told us that the flight was delayed and then was also canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport, the same as for the first time. Just those from Bergen airport gave us a paper stating our rights and they said that Wizzair will contact us, but no one has contacted us. I called WizzAir again. They couldn't find any other alternative flights, and asked me to send them a claim to get a refund and any other expense that I lost due to the two cancellations. I received a SMS at 06.00 am that the flight was canceled. (7 hours after the scheduled departure time). As a result of that , we could not travel to Poland and we missed the hotel accommodation, the flight from Gdansk to Warsaw, the car rental fee in Katowice and on top of that we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I searched again and again and I found another route with another airline and of course the price was doubled. The original price was around 9000 Norwegian krone. The only available tickets that I found cost over 20000 NOK. I had to book it.

255,Alicia Martinez,United Kingdom,2022-08-21,1,"I don't usually leave reviews, however I think it may help other passengers predict and plan their own trips, and it would have been helpful had I been better prepared. We chose to fly with Wizz Air primarily because of the flight times that suited our schedule. Checking in was fine, there were hidden costs that can be expected from budget airlines. I downloaded the App which was not helpful as I had to constantly find the email with my code to access any part of the app. Finding the email was also a challenge as Wizz Air had sent me tons of promotional junk emails. Anyway, all that aside, we were on our merry way. On both flights the luggage check in queue was enormous. We arrived 3 hours before our flight which was not international and were almost late because of the queue. We only queued to tag our pram as we were travelling light, but there was no one to ask and it was not clear on the site. Both flights there was only one staff member for premium and one staff member for economy so either way the queue was ridiculous. Fine, we thought we had the time as Wizz Air (on both trips) had texted to say the flight was delayed. However none of the airport gate signs indicated the flight was delayed so after rushing through, skipping any sort of food with a baby we made it to the gate to leave. The airport sign actually said 'gate closing' but when we arrived there was just a lot of people sitting on the floor wondering what was going on. Eventually after about an hour an announcement that the cabin crew were in the airport was made, but no indication of how long was given. On our outbound flight we waited for an hour and half and ransacked the vending machine to feed our family and on the return flight we must have waited over 2 hours, again in a waiting area with very little seating, I had to stand for almost 2 hours with a 2 year old whilst being almost 7 months pregnant.

266,S Hakeen,United Kingdom,2022-08-03,1,"We never actually flew because Wizz Air cancelled our flight a couple of hours before. This route had been cancelled around 30% of the time and rest landed late. Trying to rebook or get a refund online is impossible and doesn't work despite them keeping on directing you to do that. Contacting Wizz Air is also impossible and made extremely difficult, they encourage you to call their premium rate number but don't make clear you can call their ""special assistance"" number for free when delays or cancellation are involved. You then have to wait hours to finally speak to someone. They offered us a flight a week later which would have meant missing most of our holiday - we stupidly accepted as we were put on the spot. We tried calling back to get a refund when we realised our mistake but they wouldn't allow us to get a refund. We are due compensation under EU law regardless for the delay, but they don't care about the law and get away with it because civil aviation authorities don't do anything despite them breaching the law all the time. They also refused to tell us the reason for the delay.

I told her there was no issues in Dubai airport and they said it's ok they just adjust her date of birth with nothing more. Then she asked about her vaccination report I told her I'm going home and they don't request vaccination report or even PCR test. She was looking for anything just to make it more difficult for us. After that she told me to wait few minutes for the Hungarian airline reply. Few minutes she left her desk so I went to other guy working in special assistance desk I gave him the passport and the booking number.

We arrived in Santorini too late for the (latest) 11.00 p.m. car pick up. This meant we spent 40 Euros (taxi fare) to travel to our accommodation.

288,David Yates,United Kingdom,2022-07-16,1,"The flight was due to take off at 16:20, everything was loaded and ready to go before a security team had to come on board to remove a rowdy customer which delayed the departure till 16:50. We were in Dubrovnik airspace when the captain informed us that the weather conditions were bad and we circled the airport for 45 minutes before being diverted to Zagreb. We were informed by the captain that there would be a coach to take us to Dubrovnik airport which is a 600km drive (between 6-9hours!) Once we finally disembarked at Dubrovnik at around 10:30pm we were met by nobody, there wasn’t a representative from Wizz Air or anyone else, we were left for 75 minutes not knowing where to go or what to do. At 11:45pm a bunch of coaches arrived at which point mayhem ensued! People scrabbling it get on, and we could only hope that it was for Dubrovnik as the driver spoke no English. We arrived in Dubrovnik at 10:15am, over 14 hours later than it was due to arrive. What should have been a 2:45 minute flight turned into a nearly 18 hours of hell. 10th July 2022 flight number W95174. We were informed in good time that our outbound flight from the original departure time of 20:50 to 21:50. But it was then delayed further to 22:34 and again to 23:29 and yet again to 00:39! And then after an hour of waiting we were informed that the flight had been cancelled and to come forward for 4 euro voucher. Yes 4 euros for waiting 4 hours, one euro per hour!

289,Ashraf Aly,Norway,2022-07-15,1,"I booked with Wizz Air 4 tickets from Bergen to Gdansk. In order to travel to Warsaw with (another airline) on the second day, then to travel with Wizz Air from Warsaw to Tenerife in Canary Islands (Spain). When we were in Bergen Airport and just 1 hour before boarding, they announced that the flight will be delayed for 40 minutes and after a while it was delayed again for 2 hours. 1 hour again after the new date, they announced that the flight is canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport to inform us what to do. We went home and tried to contact them. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone, they said that there's no other flights available, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried with my own to find out another solution, and I found a flight after 8 hours to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car to drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured that everything is OK. We went to the Bergen Airport again with our kids, and 5 minutes before the new boarding, they told us that the flight is delayed and then is canceled also without giving any reason. I called them again, they couldn't find any other alternative flights. We couldn't of course travel to Warsaw and we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I searched again and again and I found another route with another airlines and of course the price was tripled. I sent them a claim and they replied that the cancelation was because of extraordinary circumstances without mentioning what was the circumstances! Thus they can't offer a refund or compensation!

296,Mildred Dowdswell Dowdswell,United States,2022-07-05,1,"My party and I are very disappointed with Wizz Air. We had just flown into Milan from New York and we were connecting to Cagliari, Sardinia in April 2022. We were sure to have our bags the allotted and accepted sizes. When we went to the Check-in Desk, the woman at the check-in in Milan said that we needed to purchase our boarding passes. She further stated that two of our bags were not compliant when indeed there were others identical that went through without being charged an extra hundred dollars. The folks traveling with us are 80 years old, one with a cane, and this woman showed no compassion. Because my phone was in airplane mode on the flight right before this, I was unable to check in within 3 hours prior to this flight. I had my tickets and barcode on my phone. She gave us two little pieces of paper and we had to go to this kiosk and wait 15 minutes in line to purchase two more boarding passes. We had purchased these tickets through e-Dreams where each time I purchased a ticket, the price went up. I paid an extra $125 for two more boarding passes. I was about to pay for my personal ticket but then I thought, I am going to go straight to the line and not go through that woman because I have my ticket. That worked for me, but the elderly couple were extremely distraught and upset over this experience. I ended up ordering two new tickets for them for the return trip. I double-ordered because I did not want to get saddled with another boarding pass fee. I did not use e-Dreams either this time and that helped. I contacted Customer Support a I do not like to write negative reviews, but they kept giving me the run-around. Incidentally, we got through with our bags on the return trip as we refused to go to the check-in desk and our bags were fine sidewise.

311,A Rowens,United Kingdom,2022-06-19,1,"This is not an airline. The delay takes so much of your time – almost as long as the actual flight. Before you arrive to the airport, you’ll have an email saying that the plane is delayed for around 1 hour. By the time you walk inside the airport lounge, there will be another delay for 35 minutes. When you are queuing for the gate and passport clearance, another 30 minutes. Then, just when you think you’ve finally made it inside the plane and ready to take off, they slap you with an additional 45 minutes delay. You get an almost 3 hours delay in what is supposed to be a 3.5 hours flight. You’d think by then at least they’ll give you free peanuts for compensation.  If they could legally monetise your complaints and suffering, I bet they would. Yet I still consider myself getting a comparatively better flight experience, compared to what other reviewers are saying here. If you’re using online check-in, make sure you pay for the £2 option for “online check in”, even if they stated that online check in will be available “for free” 48 hours before flight. If you don’t pay, the website/app will display an error on the last step of your check in. Changing browser, clearing cache, or calling the customer service won’t help you.

314,Andrew McDougall,United Kingdom,2022-06-14,10,"I found Wizz Air to be an excellent airline. From booking on the website to check in and service. I flew with my mother who needed assistance and she was looked after at London Gatwick and in Athens. The website is easy to navigate and I found the prices to be reasonable. I would not hesitate to fly Wizz Air again. The check in crew and the cabin crew were fantastic and I did witness how the check in crew in Athens were insulted and sworn at when all they were doing was their job. I also witnessed how some people blatantly lied to try and get what they wanted, such as the woman who had 3 cases but only paid for one and then refused to pay for the other 2 and blamed the very patient and polite man at the check in desk. Its amazing how people want to pay less but expect and demand more and then blame the staff for their incompetence.

These passengers could decide not to travel or follow up the missing bags later. We then boarded to be held on the ground for 2 hours while they attempted to resolve what transpired to me a wildcat strike by ground staff.

Then upon emailing their customer service about the situation, with photos of receipts and boarding pass, they denied me a reimbursement, citing it was my responsibility to do the check-in before, whereas it was theirs to provide me access to the check-in.

371,William Critchlow,United Kingdom,2021-11-25,3,"Wizz Air is a cheap airline and like all cheap airlines they seem to pile on the money by charging for your seat after you have purchased a ticket. So the fee you see is just to get you through the door - any bag larger than a shoe box you pay for - check in at the airport £35 per person. Seats - The price you see is for a ticket. I am yet to find a way to book without being charged £20 on top for a seat. Regardless of whether I choose the seats or allow them to. If there is a way, it’s hidden or not obvious. Inflight - Usual small selection of expensive snacks - anything goes wrong expect to be quoted terms and conditions stating they can’t help and you should have known this. Refunds - if you actually manage to get one it is to a Wizz Air account to use with Wizz Air. So not actually a refund at all. It cost me €70+ euros for checking in 2 people at the airport which I was forced to do as their app is unreliable. It always seems to crash when trying to use it to check in so you need to check in from a computer. I was one of many dozen at the airport on both recent occasions when I travelled with the same issue and same huge additional bill to pay before we could travel. They don’t care, they say pay or don’t travel and lose all the money as our refund policy prevents you refunding under such circumstances unless you bay x 10 for a flexible refundable ticket.

374,S Weare,Canada,2021-10-29,2,"There is a new model of airline that desperately wants to undercut the prices of other airlines to get your business, and that is Wizz Air. They present a low priced ticket to snipe your attention and your money, then once you’ve committed your purchase, they add on all of the extras. Do you  want to sit with your young child? They’ll charge you for that. Do you want to carry a bag with you larger than a computer case? They’ll charge you for that. Did you want to check in for your flight somehow? They’ll charge you for that (they even charge for online check in). You get a cheap price up front until they secure your business, but once they have it, the stack on the extra fees until your ticket price becomes comparable to an actual reputable airline. You will not be able to fly without paying extra fees. Because I didn’t check in online the day before (because you know, I have things to do before I go on vacation) they charged me an extra $150 dollars just to do a regular check in. Then, because I had a cabin-sized bag and a camera bag, they charged me an extra $25 for that. Then because I didn’t pay for assigned seats they actually sat my four year old child away from us. They had it on record that he was four years old and their seating arrangement came up with that! Can you believe it? Sure we could switch it around so he wasn’t unaccompanied, but they were perfectly fine with separating the child from his family because a fee wasn’t paid. That’s a pretty gross business practice and I almost wonder if it was intentional because a fee wasn’t paid. For real. This becomes a moral and ethical issue when they will make a child sit alone unless you pay an extra fee for seating. It’s actually a disgusting business model and I will never fly this deceptive airline again. Just pay the extra money for a more reputable airline instead of this sneaky nonsense that Wizz Air pulls on its clients. So what is Wizz Air prioritizing? Cheap shot fees over customer service and satisfaction. DO NOT book this airline because it looks like a deal. It is not a good deal. They will loot you in one way or another by the time you get on that plane, and if you don’t pay the extra fees, they’ll show you why you better pay them in advance next time. Go with a more reputable airline that doesn’t hide fees and carry on such underhanded business. Somewhere a board of directors is congratulating itself for this business model. So much for ethics and customer service. Cleary a thing of the past.

382,Jean Kallenburg,Czech Republic,2021-09-26,1,"I had an extremely negative experience with Wizz Air yesterday while attempting to fly to Reykjavik. First, I received my boarding pass on my phone prior to arrival at the airport and didn't need to check any baggage, so I went straight through security and into the airport. Budapest airport doesn't announce the gate for your flight until about 30 minutes prior to check-in closing, so I waited around for a while. Finally, my gate information appears and I went straight to my gate to check in (almost the first one in line). Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. ""Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers – regardless of origin – are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection."" - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return. No matter the suggestion I made, the Wizz Air authorities were disrespectful and adamant that I do not board the plane. And I believe its also relevant to add that I'm a 19 year old solo female traveler, for which the thought of missing my flight and being stranded in a foreign country is not particularly pleasant, however I was met with no sympathy from anyone during this experience.

419,Andrei Roibu,United Kingdom,2021-06-11,1,"I would like to make a formal complaint about the crew on the Wizz Air morning flight from Luton to Cluj from the 11th of June, regarding their lack of action towards enforcing Covid safety rules and regulations. Many of the passengers on the flight were either not wearing masks at all, or wearing them in such a way that it was neither covering their mouth nor their nose. I initially kindly asked some of the infringing passengers to properly wear the mask, to which they first ignored me and then they started making insulting comments towards me in Romanian (I speak the language so I understood what they said). When I raised this issue with members of the crew, they shrugged me off and told me that there is nothing they can do about it and that I should sort this issue. I do not believe that it is the job of passengers to enforce basic covid safety rules, and I also believe that the airline has a duty of care towards all its passengers. The incident made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe during the entire duration of the flight. Moreover, I noticed that during the entire duration of the flight, no member of the flight crew took any measure or said anything towards other rule infringing passengers, not even when passengers without masks were passing by them on the corridor. I find this to be unacceptable, for a member of the flight crew to pass multiple infringing passengers on the corridor and not do even as much as ask them to follow international guidelines and regulations regarding safety during the Covid Pandemic.

420,E Tannel,United Kingdom,2021-06-11,2,"Used Wizzair pre pandemic happily and successfully. I used to like them and used often for flights to many countries. But alas, the airline has changed! Now it feels that they are solving their cash flow problems by allowing new booking only to cancel them later, often “at the last minute” (a few hours before the flight). My flights to Moscow in June 2021 were cancelled twice, second time I was already in a hotel near the airport as the flight was very early morning, so had to come in the ending. So I lost money on transport, COVID test and hotel. My friends flight to St Petersburg was also cancelled, she opted for a refund which is promised in 30 days… Good luck with that. When they cancel the flight, they offer refund or re-book, but refund only for “new” money, not if your used credit accumulated with them during pandemic for the past cancelled flights… so I had to re-book. And since then my booking was cancelled or amended three more times within 2 days. Dates get pushed further and further away from originally booked flights, like a month and a half later. I checked availability on site prior rebooking and noticed that tickets price is 3-4 times higher than mine… so my guess is that my booking is being bumped off as they sell tickets for much higher price! Or may be they don’t intend to fly at all, just collect new payments anyway to save themselves…. In addition some add-on services are NOT refundable as it turned out, specifically “provided by partners”. Once after cancellation and request to add credit to the account I discovered that around £18 “disappeared” without explanation. I’m not sure what “service” was deducted. I only had “priority” added, I wouldn’t have thought it was a partner service.

Note that the Wizz Air online check-in closes 3 hours before departure! 2) To not pay for the check-in, according to the Wizz Air website, is possible at the airport by using the self-service check-in, and if those are not available at the traditional check-in desk. 3) However, this is not the case. At Milan Malpensa Terminal 1 on Friday, and at Vienna Terminal 3 on Sunday (today), there was no self-service check-in available (I confirmed this with the available check-in staff), and the traditional check-in counter would only check us in if we paid €15/person. 4) This is not all, at MXP the payment is handled by another desk which charges a €5/person commission and at VIE the commission is €5/transaction. So when you book with Wizz Air you need on paying at least €7-8 for the check-in online, or €15 if you do so at the airport plus €5 commission. This is not an optional extra service! By the way, the check-in staff cannot help you because they ""do not work for Wizz Air"" (they told me this in both MXP as well as VIE).

From Italian airport we were going with slightly heavier suitcase. And we know by experience that on almost empty flights it’s not a problem. They checked us in without charging. But in Romanian airport coming back they charged us 60€ for 7 kg overweight. Can you imagine that we paid 51€ for 20kg both ways and now they charge us for 60€ in PLUS for 7kg. And the problem is that I would gladly pay adequate sum of money for those 7kg but they prefer to lose clients for one time profit.

456,Malcolm Conlan,United Kingdom,2020-08-07,6,"Only my second time to fly with Wizz air.  I got a ticket for £25 return. Then you pay for various extras. I paid for 10KG luggage I didn’t actually need. I thought I was signing up for priority but to be honest I did the booking quickly and didn’t read everything. Trick is to read very carefully regarding the numerous add on options. I only had a really small bag so didn’t need that add on at all. What I should have done was chose my seating at the time of booking. I waited till after and it ended up costing me more. No doubt about it, their software will stick you in a middle seat, probably far away form anyone else in the booking. Trick is to select your seat at the time of Booking. I am 6 ft so needed an aisle seat. I got this. The flight was manageable for me, even though my other leg was pressing against the seat but it wasn’t uncomfortable. With my other leg in the aisle as much as possible. Was an hour and a half late on the outbound and 30 min late inbound. On the outbound this was an airport issue. New plane. Good take off and landing. On the return MXP to LTN would like to give a special shout out to Marta who was very nice, polite and friendly. Good experience all round. My flight came to £95 with the extras but still cheaper than other airlines. The days of mega cheap fares are still there as long as you have no luggage and take it as it comes. Again £25 for a return to Italy isn’t bad. They handed Covid measures well. They constantly reminded people to wear a mask which was good. But obviously the plane was full.

459,Roland Koops-Vytopil,Austria,2020-07-12,7,"First experience with Wizz out of Vienna did not start nicely since after booking my trip to Bremen I received an email informing me that my outgoing flight was changed to the following day. Since it was planned to be a 10 days trip I accepted it, soon after that I received another email with the information that my inbound flight was moved forward one day because of ""operational reasons"". So accepting this again finally meant that my entire trip was cut down from 10 to 8 days. The next point on the downside was that after these changes I got the information that my flights were unable for online check-in. However my partner could check-in online without problems although I was the one with the so called ""priority"" status. Because of that I ended up with center seats on both sectors. I have to mention that check-in on both airports was smooth and done within 2 minutes. I also have to say that for short flights the Wizz Airseat configuration is acceptable but definitely not what you would get on premium airlines (230 instead of 200 allows an idea how tight everything is). The crew was nice and seemed to be motivated and drinks from the onboard bistro service were sold at reasonable prices. Both flights landed ahead of time and WIZZ managed the new COVID procedures very well and distributed the necessery health declarations during boarding. Would I recommend WIZZ for short flights?

461,G KIaridos,Greece,2020-07-10,1,"I bought the expensive (FLEX or something) ticket for 1 July from Luton to Thessaloniki for 26th July. The Greek Government  said that direct flights from the UK to Greece would continue to not be permitted from 1 July (they were not permitted during June, and they were thinking of allowing them from 1st July onwards, but changed their minds, and first announced that on 26th June). He also said that the official announcement was going to come out on 29th June. I didn't want to wait till 1 day before my flight for WizzAir to cancel it (and I found out from others that they ended up cancelling it on the 30th and a mere 14 hours before the actual flight), thus I tried to book another flight. In that effort, I ended up cancelling my ticket which led to the first ridiculous policy they have - it takes 72 hours for them to put the ""refunded"" money into a ""Wizz Air account"", why 72 hours? The second ridiculous policy is that after they added it I would only have 3 months to book another flight with them, otherwise they keep the money, which is ridiculously short even for pre-COVID times, it should be 12 months at least, and probably 24 or 36 now that COVID is around. I would have found that reasonable. But regardless, I couldn't wait 72 hours to book another flight with them, so I ended up booking with another company for my actual flight. Once the 72 hours passed, my money was added to the ""Wizz Air Account"", after which I proceeded to try to get a refund to one of my actual bank accounts. In that process, they ask for the reason for the refund, and they have two new options ""Cancellation initiated by Wizz Air due to COVID"" and ""Cancellation initiated by customer due to COVID"" - I picked the second option, assuming that there is a difference from a similar cancellation pre-COVID times, and thus that I would actually get a refund (otherwise what's the point of having such an option). Apparently, cancelling my flight due to COVID (a flight which was gonna get cancelled for sure by them eventually) and having bought the more expensive ticket wasn't enough to get a refund.

I contacted Wizz Air on 15/06/20 at regarding my booking to enquire what my cash refund would be if I were to cancel my flights. The agent I was speaking to confirmed that an amount of £1221.00 would be refunded back to my credit card. The difference between what I actually paid £1609 is what they are charging as a cancelation charge. The agent further clarified that the amount of £1221.00  would be credited to my credit card account within 2/3 weeks. Upon being given this information and only because this information was given to me I agreed to cancel my booking.  Shortly after cancelling the aforementioned booking I made an entirely new booking for the same flight & date for only £670.00.   I called Wizz Air again just to re-confirm that I should expect the refund to my credit card no later that within 2/3 weeks only to be told that the agent I spoke to on 15/06/20 with whom based on the information they had given me & proceeded to cancel my original flights with had in fact given me incorrect information & that I would not be receiving a refund to my credit card but instead the amount of £1221 would be credited to a Wizz Account and that I would need to use this credit within 3 months!!  This agent proceeded to advise me that Wizz Air cannot be held responsible for a colleagues error which is an absolute ridiculous & totally unacceptable statement to be made.

And if on my original booking I had a package with priority boarding and large trolley on board, they only gave me back the priority boarding (useless by the way) so I had to pay another £30 on top of my original booking for nothing. The only way to contact them is through a call centre which charges a fortune (so stay away from it). This company used to be a lot better some years ago but it got worse and worse, year after year. I remember when I used to get £60 flights with return from UK to Romania and with £25 extra for a membership you would get benefits like priority boarding, free seat selection and extra large trolley.

476,L Bale,United Kingdom,2020-05-02,1,"I bought return tickets for my entire family (5 persons, one of which 3 years old) for the above mentioned flights in October 2019. The flight was scheduled for 19 May 2020. Given the worldwide pandemic crisis, lockdown restrictions were set in place by the government of Romania and UK. As such, I called WizzAir customer service at the beginning of April 2020 to enquire about the flight status. I was advised that the flight was still going ahead as planned and that passengers will be informed about cancellations due to Covid19 via email (when applicable). When I asked about the notice period I was informed there is not a set notice period and it could vary from 2 weeks to next-day cancellation notice. WizzAir personnel advised me not to cancel my booking as yet and wait for further communication closer to the flight date, and that if I still wanted to cancel the flights due to the Covid19 pandemic and further restrictions inposed by government then I should do so 14 days prior to flight date to ensure I am not charged additional cancellation fees. I called customer service again on the 1st of May 2020 and I was advised the flight is still going ahead as scheduled and if I wanted to cancel the flights WizzAir will charge 60 Euros/person/flight. This is unacceptable considering the current worldwide situation, and more specifically the restrictions imposed by the government. The UK is under lockdown with no end date in sight (at the point of this complaint), which means all non-essential travel is not permitted. Additionally, social distancing restrictions are further imposed by the Romanian Government and the UK government, including 2 meters distance between people. These measures were not respected. As such, the flight should have been cancelled, in line with government guidelines. It is not acceptable for a company not to adhere to Government guidelines and put customers at risk. I find it appalling that flights are not cancelled in advance by WizzAir (given specific lockdown instructions set by the government) and that passengers are required to cancel the flights more than 14 days prior to the flight so that the cancellation fees are not increased. It is absurd to charge the cancellation fee per person per flight and not per booking, meaning that the customer receives a 10th of the price paid. Based on the information I received from the WizzAir staff, the flight cancellation period varies from 2 weeks to 1 day. This means WizzAir deliberately does not adhere to WHO and Government (country specific) guidelines and restrictions, so that they can retain most of the price paid by customers when booking flights. Aside from this blatant disregard for pandemic restrictions, the customer service personnel was rude and dismissive over the phone, with no willingness to discuss the options available for customers. When I was given the information relating to the cost of cancellation, the call handler was abrupt and repeatedly asked me ""Should I cancel this or not?"" without allowing me the time to process the information received and to calculate/ understand how much will all this cost.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,February 2020,,,,,,,1,no,True,,,,Negative,-0.9821,  buy return ticket entire family 5 person one 3 year old mention flight october 2019 schedule 19 may 2020 give worldwide pandemic crisis lockdown restriction set place government romania uk call customer service begin april 2020 enquire status advise still go ahead plan passenger inform cancellation due covid19 via email applicable asked notice period inform set notice period vary 2 week cancellation notice personnel advise cancel booking yet wait communication closer date still want cancel flight due covid19 pandemic restriction inposed government 14 day prior date ensure charge additional cancellation fee call customer service 1st may 2020 advise still go ahead schedule want cancel flight charge 60 unacceptable consider current worldwide situation specifically restriction imposed government uk lockdown end date sight point complaint mean travel permit additionally social distancing restriction impose romanian government uk government include 2 meter distance people measure respect cancelled line government guideline acceptable company adhere government guideline put customer risk find appalling flight cancel advance give specific lockdown instruction set government passenger require cancel flight 14 day prior cancellation fee increase absurd charge cancellation fee per person per per book mean customer receive 10th price pay base information receive staff cancellation period vary 2 week 1 day mean deliberately adhere government country specific guideline restriction retain price paid customer book flight aside blatant disregard pandemic restriction customer service personnel rude dismissive phone willingness discus option available customer give information relate cost cancellation call handler abrupt repeatedly ask cancel without allow time process information receive understand much cost

I use wizzair every year to go to Sofia to see my family and every time I get fucked up. If it is too big a bag, a problem of online check-in I find myself paying up to 70€ more. Sometimes to pass online check-in you have to select seats on the plane, but you have to pay 35 € / person. This time, because the plane was advanced one day, there were problems with online check-in. My husband and I decided to go to the airport earlier to avoid paying the fees. But there again we had to pay € 70 to print our tickets! A shame ""We understand but there is nothing we can do the service is blocked"". In addition to uncomfortable planes, barbaric schedules, absent customer service, there are delays and cancellations every time. And in the end we pay as much as a normal first class plane. Wizzair is the worst experience every time. They make every trip painful.  Wizz Air est à chaque fois la pire expérience! Leurs prix compétitifs vous attirent mais une fois à l’aéroport vous payez parfois le double du prix de votre billet d’avion. J’utilise chaque année wizzair pour aller à Sofia voir ma famille et à chaque fois je me fais avoir. Si c’est un sac trop grand, un problème de check-in online je me retrouve à payer jusqu’à 70€ en plus. Parfois pour réussir le check-in online il faut sélectionner des places dans l’avion, mais il faut payer 35€/personne. Cette fois, parce que l’avion a été avancé d’un jour, il y a avait des soucis de check-in online. Mon mari et moi avons décidé d’aller plus tôt à l’aéroport afin de ne pas payer les frais. Mais là à nouveau on a dû payer 70€ pour imprimer nos tickets! Une honte « Nous comprenons mais on ne peut rien faire le service est bloqué ». En plus des avions qui sont inconfortables, des horaires barbares, un service client absent, on a, à chaque fois des retards ou des annulations. Et au final on paye aussi cher qu’un avion normal en première classe. Wizzair est la pire expérience à chaque fois. Ils rendent chaque voyage pénible.

492,Mennatullah Hendawy,Germany,2020-03-10,1,"Berlin to Budapest. Unfortunately, I see myself forced to write a negative review for my first and only experience with Wizz Air. If you are a traveller or enjoy visiting new cities please take 2 mins to read this: I had a flight from Berlin to Budapest on 6.12.2019, it was overbooked so I was denied boarding. I contacted the airlines in the next day and until today I didn’t receive the compensation as per the EU regulations. I was accused of not showing up at the counter to take the denied boarding form. This is not true because I showed up in the counter and was given back the check-in money in cash. In addition, I was granted a one night stay at the airport’s hotel and the officers clarified to me to claim the compensation online. So how can I not show up in the counter and take these? I understand that an overbooked flight can just happen but what is not accepted is to spend 40+ days sending several emails to get the compensation. At the moment I am not sure if this review will move something yet I think that when someone reads this will definitely think twice before booking with Wizzair.

When we explained that we didn't and attempted to show both old tickets as well as information on commonwealth territories, they ignored us and rudely spoke over us.

499,M Kielen,United Kingdom,2020-02-24,2,"Wizz Air never seems to stop surprising with its tendency of maximising their profit and reducing their service quality at the same time. This time we flew from Luton to Sofia  and back. And despite doing everything in the same way as before each time I failed to have all my family sitting together when opting for the automatically allocated seats. And I’m not talking about being split by isle or next row but 5-6 rows apart. So now the only way to have all of us sit together is by paying a premium of 17 Euros per person each way which adds nearly 140€ to our already high fares (half term craze)! I could be listing all minor issues with Wizzair for hours but another major one is the ridiculously low luggage allowance they call “free on-board baggage” which really only allows you to have a small backpack or ladies purse. The only way around it is guess what (?) paying around £50 extra to have a 20kg checked-in bag or purchase priority service which then gives you the same allowance you’d get with every other airline in the world. Finally just to show how bad their service is, when we were being transferred back to Sofia airport and been asked which terminal we’d be flying from, there was no way of getting this information from neither the Wizzair emails, their ticket or even their website. Instead we had to google it and verify from a 3rd party website which is just a joke!

508,M Simpson,United Kingdom,2020-02-07,1,"London Luton to Tirana. I would give 0/10 but that is not an option. The size of the hand luggage is ludicrously small for one piece. When booking I bought the extra size. I was then annoyed to see at the check in those who had larger than the allowed size were being let through without having to pay more, some had two or three bags. The staff were mentioning it was too big to some but letting them through anyway, some they were charging. If the policy is to allow bigger bags fair enough but what is really unfair is my bag was only slightly bigger than the allowed size, so why did others not have to pay for bigger and I did? (I took pictures to prove it). I complained about this via the form on the website and the response had nothing to do with the complaint. I replied saying this and they said it was too late now.

I kept on leaving messages on twitter, eventually they told me to call the number I originally, although that was a battle to get it from them. I called and was told no one on that number could help and as for the lack of service he wouldn’t apologise “as it was nothing to do with him”.

514,W Darner,Qatar,2020-01-26,1,"Vienna to Malaga. They separated the whole Family.  We have booked 4 tickets 2 Adults 2 Kids (7 ,8). Online checkin did not work for us, so we arrived at the airport and had to pay 125 Euros to checkin. We had to run to another terminal to pay this fee, and come back to show the receipt, otherwise no boarding passes??  According to ticket we were allowed to take 4 small bags. We have bought 4 small bags specifically for this trip with a maximum of 6 kg as described (same size as a backpack, but very small trollies). Nevertheless the weight and size didn't matter to checkin staff and they made us pay another 65 euros, since they were not a backpack and looked like trollies. For what reason does Wizzair have weight and size restrictions if they don't stick to . Arriving at the Gate, without any seats assigned we went to the lady at the gate, who told us that the flight is overbooked and we will have to wait until the end with our 2 little kids to see if they can take us. The screen at the gate showed families with children have priority boarding (didn't look like). At the end only my wife was able to board the plane, and I was left behind with my two kids.

Then we travelled back 3 days later and found that the flight was on time and it was almost as though we were flying with a different Airline. Exactly the same situation occurred, many empty seats. We asked the same question to the Stewardess ""Flora"". She was so rude that I was shocked at how someone could be so rude in public whilst working for a company that prides itself on having repeat customers and giving good service. She offered the wide leg space seats for 15 Euros per seat. She said she just follows Wizz Air policy. We asked ""How can Wizz Air policy be valid in one direction but not the other?. She didnt answer our question. She then said we can sit next to each other but not with the extra leg room. Then we started searching for other seats and she made no attempt to offer us any help at all. Others customers who were embarrassed by her behaviour offered us their help. Has this woman never heard of Customer Service. I had thought this was a service business. The seats could not have been sold as we were already in the air. This Stewardess was an embarrassment to Wizz Air. She attempted to publicly embarrass us both for asking the question and so many other customers could see this and offered us help themselves.

585,Kevin Brown,United States,2019-10-18,2,"Porto to Luton. I paid an extra for fee for services that Wizz Air calls ""Wizz Priority"" and which they state includes: ""PRIORITY CHECK-IN, dedicated check-in desk to drop your luggage faster"" and ""precedence when boarding the aircraft - you will also be called first for boarding."" I paid for those services for 4 tickets: myself, my wife, my two daughters. We did not receive that service. On check-in the ""PRIORITY CHECK-IN"" line did not get priority. It was actually 3 times longer than the check in line for passengers that did not pay for Wizz Priority. We got lowered priority. This was because Wizz had twice as many check-in staff attending to non-priority customers as priority customers, even though there were more priority customers in line. At the gate, there was no priority in boarding. Everyone was called to board at the same time. We were not called first for boarding and received no precedence. I complained in person, and in writing.

591,M Noémie ,Canada,2019-10-09,1,"Otopeni to Bergamo. I got denied boarding, without even scanning my ticket! I was about to board the plane when an employee stops me and tells that I will have to pay my carry-on 25€. I answer that I’ve already paid for this luggage as proved on my ticket. She refuses to listen to me and tells me that my luggage doesn’t fit into the hand luggage measures that goes under the seat. Of course, I paid for my carry-on that goes in the overhead compartment and it fully corresponds to the measures and weight of Wizz Air policy and which was previously accepted on my inbound flight. I am told since I did not leave my luggage at check-in, the supplement is inevitable, so I agree to pay. I am directed to a second employee and now she is ordering me to put my purse in my carry on otherwise she will charge me 60€! I am shocked because this second extra is totally unjustified. I then ask for explanations for these fees, her rude answer: If you refuse to pay, a stand-by will be happy to take your place! I say a second time that I do not refuse to pay the 60€, but I wish explanations why I should 1) Pay my carry-on a 2nd time 2) Pay my little purse which is clearly indicated as free on your website. To this question, the employee impolitely responds: You will not board the plane, I give your ticket to someone else. Without raising the tone on my part, I beg her to let me in, I was ready to pay 60€ and look for explanations later but it was too late, and the employee had let the stand by take my place and closed the gate on me and another customer without any valid explanation.

592,G Duncan,United Kingdom,2019-10-07,1,"Truly shocked by how horrible and stressful the Wizz Air experience was. 1) Check-in queue was 1 hour long and chaotic because they were inefficient and disorganised. 2) After we queued for 1 hour, they told us we had to pay a €35 fine because we ""should have checked in online"". Nowhere in the online booking process or emails was this made clear. In fact the opposite. It appears to be an intentional extortion technique. 3) We were told to leave the queue, pay the fine, and then queue all over again, even if it meant missing our flight. And that there was no other option. 4) The young girl on the check-in counter was incredibly rude and obnoxious, treating us like petty criminals. 5) When we finally got back to a check-in counter after paying the fine and re-queuing, another young girl forgot to print out our boarding passes before sending us on our way. ""Oh yeah, I forgot"" she said, when we asked ""shouldn't we have boarding passes?"". Pathetic. Even if you argue that we should have checked in online (we didn't because we'd already paid extra for our seats so assumed we could simply check in at the airport, as standard, since it absolutely was not made clear), the size of the penalty (€35 each) is extortionate, it was vindictive and cruel to make us queue all over again after a 1 hour wait, their spiteful attitude was horrible, and they displayed incompetence and disorganisation at every stage.

Boarding was efficient and good to see that Wizz Air staff ensure that priority passengers are actually given priority in boarding. Cabin crew were business-like and pleasant. Announcements from the flight deck were audible and informative. Wizz Air sent useful SMS the day prior to the flight home advising of possible air-traffic delays (which did not materialise). Most of the low marks awarded to Wizz Air on Skytrax appear to be attributable to the fact that customers do not (or can not) read the terms and conditions (T&C) attaching to the tickets.

618,J Narlon,United Kingdom,2019-08-26,7,"Bucharest to Luton. The overall onboard experience was pleasant. My WIZZ Flex ticket allowed me to choose an emergency exit row seat (26F) with ample legroom.

The cabin crew were very friendly and welcoming throughout the flight. There was a good selection of food and beverages available onboard and they were reasonably priced. When I arrived at the gate for this flight we were informed that the flight was delayed but unfortunately no passenger announcement was made to explain why. When I asked the employee at the gate they told me that the expected delay would be an hour. An hour later, we were told that our flight would depart from a different gate and we made our way to the alternate gate. We then waited another hour with no announcements made before the boarding process commenced and we were able to get on the buses. It was only once we had boarded our aircraft that we were told that the delay had been caused by a maintenance issue and that the pilot's windscreen had now been repaired.

Their computer gave me and my wife two separate places on opposite ends of the plane on both flights, so we couldn't sit together. Many other people on the plane were in the same situation.

They could have given people seats together in random places and charge for the option to choose the seats location.

We had to pay 100 Euro to fly with our small luggage cases on both flights. And we gave up the option to travel with a big luggage case like we always do because it was too expensive to add this option.

627,V Ward,United Kingdom,2019-08-09,7,"Flying with Wizz air from Luton at the end of July was a bit of a shambles - this was due to people making their own queues and then people pushing in. Also we had to put our suitcases which were under 20kg in the oversized baggage area which we have never had to do before and we have had the vases for 10 years, which we had to queue for again. Also when you were boarding they left you in a tunnel for a good 20 minutes in the heat before allowing you on the flight. But the staff were friendly and the flight wasn’t to bad apart from the nearly two hour delay. Although the floor did look like it needed a good hoover.

628,P Bardam,United Kingdom,2019-08-08,1,I’ve just returned from Ohrid to Luton having been charged 35euro each for my family of 5 because I checked in at the airport.

Having spent £2400 on the flights for a 3 hr journey – getting hit for another 175euros – this adds to the generally poor Wizz Air experience – an absolute rip off. I fly 12 or 13 times a year for work to various countries and have never seen this.

No communication to passenger about the delay. Then the boarding happened at a very slow pace.

When it was time to check in we followed their instructions and downloaded the app and put our details in (we almost always check in for all our flight) and tried to check in. It wouldn't allow us and told us to go to their website. We then went to the website and tried to check in and we had issues again. Got a message saying that there was a disruption to the flight. So we printed out all our documents and went to the airport and told them we had issues checking in online using their app and website they told us we had to pay 35 euros to check in at the airport. We told them there was an issue with their system and it wasn't our fault. They forced us to pay the additional 70 euros. Ended up being the most expensive flight for us.

I had the Light “plan” selected with Wizz Priority added. I had no issues or whatsoever regarding my cabin luggage (did not have any checked-in baggage), the process at the gate went smoothly and very quickly (might be worth mentioning that on both outbound and return flights, the gate opened with a delay but regardless, everything went pretty fast afterwards). You only get priority when boarding the bus and at the gate, when they do the check-in, not when boarding the aeroplane like one may think. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful, the outbound flight was extremely smooth, no turbulences at all, the returning one had a few moments where it was slightly shaky. Yet, it was all good. The online check-in process was very easy. Be aware that if you do not check-in online, you pay a fee for the airport check-in. As for the luggage again, they even let this woman with a bag that clearly exceeded their dimensions limit in the cabin. Maybe she got lucky. Overall, I would fly Wizz again and I will in December, the same route. Absolutely love it. No “hidden” or “extra” fees as long as you read their rules carefully.

651,R Bayne,Australia,2019-07-05,1,"Budapest to Luton. We arrived to check in to see a mass of people not in structured queues as there were more than double the amount of people for the standard queue barricades they had set up. It was a funnel effect of a large mass of people trying to jam in to one small entry line with no direction from surrounding staff who were simply standing there. Nobody was taking initiative. I asked a staff member where exactly we should be queuing for our flight and she directed us to 3 counters further down. We waited in the queue for half an hour. Then a different staff member asked if I was priority. I said no. She said I need to move to the next line. Turns out two lines are standard and one is priority however we weren’t told that and the priority line was written in small writing at the front counter at the bottom of the screen. After this staff member turned several people to the correct queue I suggested to her she could go through the very large line and check with people before they spend half hour in the line only to get to her and be told it’s the wrong line. She did this and subsequently 80% of the line had to move as they were also told the wrong thing. There were a lot of angry people. We then queued for another half hour in the right line only to get to the counter and the boy behind the counter to say he could not check me in. Because I hadn’t checked in online. When in actual fact my partner who booked my ticket with his on the same booking could not book me in online. He tried several times but the website seemed to not allow it. This was an IT issue not our fault however we were being penalised by being made to now pay for a ticket to be issued. We were sent to a different desk. The guy changed some things in the system. He said due to booking through an external booking provider it causes glitches in the system and I was not in my partners booking despite having a confirmation email and having paid for my ticket. He said next time to book direct. If external booking systems don’t work, then don’t allow people to buy a ticket through them?!we then had to go back to the same counter, explain to other customers why we were pushing in and then explain to the original boy that we were permitted to continue. Of which he questioned.we then only just make it to boarding and stand inline for 20 mins before another staff member who had been looking at everyone’s bags pulled me aside to say my carry on was too big.

Mine was literally 5cm over the bar: after 20 something flights this is the first time I have been stopped.my bag fit under the seat!!!

652,Paul Carey,United Kingdom,2019-07-03,1,"Luton to Lisbon. Over the last few weeks I have taken several flights between London and Lisbon on Wizz Air. Every flight I have taken has been delayed to some extent: the shortest delay I can recall was of 20 minutes; the longest was of about 2.5 hours. My flight on 2nd July was delayed by 1.5 hours. Wizz Air has used a variety of excuses when apologising in the aircraft for the delay in taking-off and arrival so it's not even worth repeating them. There is no point passengers and potential passengers trying to identify the reasons why this company seems incapable of taking-off and landing at the correct time, particularly on certain routes and particularly from Luton. The cabin crew on all my flights have been polite and professional but they too have seemed jaded and worn-down by the lack of on-time performance; after all, a flight that lands at 2.30am (instead of at the scheduled midnight) means a very late arrival home for the crew as well. The standard crew comment that ""this is aviation and you have to expect such things"" is now becoming the company's mantra. I don't care that Wizz Air charges for all types of luggage after the first small personal item; I don't care that I have to pay for seat selection as well as for food and drink; nor do I care much about the cleanliness of the exterior and interior of the aircraft. At the end of the day, I want what most people want: I want to arrive at my destination safely and at the time shown on the timetable. I regard Wizz Air as safe but, in my experience, the chances of arriving on time at a destination are, sadly, not very high.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Luton to Lisbon,July 2019,3.0,2.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Luton,Lisbon,,Positive,0.92,  luton lisbon last week take several flight london lisbon air every take delay extent short delay recall 20 minute longest hour 2nd july delayed hour air use variety excuse apologise delay arrival worth repeat point passenger potential passenger try identify reason company seem incapable land correct time particularly certain route particularly luton cabin crew flight polite professional seemed jade lack performance land instead schedule midnight mean late arrival home crew well standard crew comment aviation expect thing become company mantra care air charge type luggage first small personal item care pay seat selection well food drink care much cleanliness exterior interior end day want people want want arrive destination safely time show timetable regard air safe experience chance arrive time destination sadly high

684,E Cipa,United Kingdom,2019-05-11,1,"Tirana to Luton. Very dissatisfied and angry with this airline. They like to rip people off. My wife and I were on our way back to Luton. We tried to check in online however their website was not working properly. Even though when we tried to do this on a laptop, phone and on different browsers and site still was not working. When I went for help to Tirana Airport they charged us €35 euros each for check in and €20 for a carry on which was within allowance (and the same carry on we had from Luton to Tirana (only one piece as we went away for less than 48 hrs)). On the same flight, half of the passengers who had to board had the same problem as us because the website was not working. As they did not want to miss their flight they were obliged to pay. As soon as we landed I complained to Wizzair online. Next day, I received a reply just copying and pasting their terms and conditions. They did not even bother to investigate this matter, no apologies no nothing. Also no refund she wrote. I replied back saying that I do not want copying and pasting paragraphs, I want a reply from the highest manager as her email was not addressing all my points and she showed no remorse. I received a second reply next day and again it was from her (they seem to not have a manager at all). At the end she wrote the following: "" I would like to inform you that Wizz Air has exhausted its internal complaint handling process"" which shows that I should not bother them anymore and as she mentioned in her previous email again ""no refund"". This airline makes sure that the online check in does not work all the time so they can cheat the passengers at the airport. At this point, I don't care about the money but I am annoyed how this airline treats the passengers.

685,L Maletina,Italy,2019-05-08,3,"Budapest to Rome. While I have nothing special to say about the onboard staff (they were neither nice nor rude, almost non-existent, I would say), I was appalled about the attitude of the Wizzair staff at the airport. First of all, the boarding gate did not appear on the display for long time (even though we were very close to the departure time). When it finally did, the number was accompanied already by a flashing ""BOARDING"" sign which put pressure on us. The gate was A17 so we followed the signs and at one point the signs indicated a direction for gates A12 - A19. Here it's when I noticed, on the side, a Wizzair staff screaming something which I could not understand so I went to her asking what is that she was saying and she was extremely rude and basically shoved us (not indicated) to another Wizzair staff (would have not been easier to put a sign akin to ""A12 to A19 except Wizzair passengers"" rather than having that rude woman screaming?"". So we went to this other person, this time a man who was checking the boarding passes and the size of the backbags without ever lifting his head and with the utmost scary expression. He sent me on one queue while my friends to another. When I asked him why, even though we were on the same flight, he sent us on two different queues, his brusque reply was: ""There is a difference, just go"". Is this a normal reply to someone who is asking you something? To a customer? I fully understood that it deeply bothers them when someone ask them a question, silly or clever that it may be, they just don't want question. I wonder why they chose this job and why there are allowed to treat people this way.

711,B Lakatera,United Kingdom,2019-03-27,1,"Athens to  Luton. I don't mind flying low-cost airlines for short flights in Europe but I am so disappointed with this airline's ground staff and online customer service, I will never use them again. I am a frequent flyer from London to Athens on low cost and upmarket airlines as well. On my return with a Wizz Air flight to LTN I discovered my suitcase wheel completely torn off leaving a gaping hole on my case (for which I paid £22 for checked luggage fyi). I went straight to the Wizz Air customer services counter and explained what just happened, I showed the damage to the ground staff and they advised me that I should just email Wizz with photos. I specifically asked if I need proof from the airport for this complaint and she simply said no, which I did find odd but that has never happened to me before so I did not know the procedure. Naturally, when I emailed Wizz from home, they demand a number of paperwork including a Property Irregularity Report, which is obtained from the airport right there and then. Even though I have explained numerous times that I do not have the PIR form due to no neglect of mine, but because their staff failed to inform me correctly at their own counter, all I get is copy-paste robotic replies that they want the PIR form in order to process my complaint. When I called and I explained once more the issue, I was told that my case would be escalated to a senior department and I will hear back in 4-6 weeks. 3 months have passed with no reply, so I contact them again to check the process of my complaint. Guess what reply I get? A copy-paste robotic request of my PIR form. I am exasperated with their handling of my case both at the airport, online and over the phone, so far this has cost me £22 for checked-in baggage fees + £100 for a new suitcase as I was travelling again a week later + £20 on the phone bill for calling their expensive customer service line!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to  Luton,November 2018,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Athens, Luton,,Negative,-0.9621,  athens luton mind fly airline short flight europe disappoint ground staff online customer service never use frequent flyer london athens low cost upmarket airline well return air ltn discover suitcase wheel completely torn leave gaping hole case pay check luggage fyi go straight air customer service counter explain happen showed damage ground staff advise email photo specifically ask need proof airport complaint simply say find odd never happen know procedure naturally email home demand number paperwork include property irregularity report obtain airport right though explained numerous time pir form due neglect mine staff fail inform correctly counter get robotic reply want pir form order process complaint call explain issue case escalate senior department hear back week 3 month pass reply contact check process complaint guess reply get robotic request pir form exasperate handle case airport online phone far cost baggage fee new suitcase travel week later phone bill call expensive customer service line

The flight to Krakow left on time and the boarding process was very straightforward and pleasant.

Despite the delay we managed to get to London on time without any problems.

He explained multiple times that he had wine in his luggage and couldn't take it through security. They were adamant for him to take it, and of course security stopped him. Then we waited an absurd amount of time to board. The employees were stopping people with a purse and luggage carry on and making them go back to the check in gate and through security.

741,L Borden,Singapore,2018-12-26,1,"Athens to Budapest. Wizz Air wasn't the cheapest but they had the flight with the most appropriate timing for my group on that day. After booking and receiving the itinerary, we received many emails from them, ranging from flash sale offers to baggage allowance changes (this detail is important for later). We got to the check-in counter more than 2 hours before our flight but were told that we had to pay 35 Eur per person because we didn't do our check-in online. Our tickets were only 55 Eur per person, which means the check-in fee is more than half the price of the tickets. Right after being told that I had to do my check-in online or via the app at least 2 hours prior to the flight, I quickly downloaded the app and tried to do my check-in. All I got was an error message saying that due to baggage allowance changes, check-in via the app was no longer possible. While waiting in line to pay for the ridiculous fees, I went through every single email sent to me by Wizz Air; I read every word of the fine prints. There was not a single mention of the fee. When I got back to the hotel, I went through the emails 3 more times, still didn't find anything. I emailed Wizz Air (which btw was a long shot because their website says that they will take up to a month to respond any email and that phone calls to their centers would cost ridiculous amounts, even if you call from within the same country). They responded by saying that I should have read their T&Cs. Here's the thing, their T&Cs is 29 pages long with 16,000 words.

We waited, and when we checked in, we could not choose seats. The three of us were placed in seat a and c in one row and the last person somewhere else. When we boarded the plane, of course they have placed a person in the b seat. The same happened on the return flight, even if the plane was far from full. I do not like their way of getting more money out of every ticket. The flight is short 1.5 hours, so it is no problem to sit in a narrow seat with your knees in the seat in front of you.

743,P Kristians,Netherlands,2018-12-18,1,"Eindhoven to Varna. I have been travelling with Wizz Air for long time, and have experienced two cancelled flights already. In occasions like this, the airline does not provide the necessary service to support passengers reach the desired destination as soon as possible. In principle, if a flight has been cancelled, the airline should provide the same flight to passenger at the soonest possibility. But  this is not the case with Wizz Air! My flight was cancelled and each passenger had to rebook him/herself the flight for another, already existing one, for which there are any free seats left. This means, some passengers may get to the desired destination in a couple of days, which is ridiculous! Also, for the time until the new flight, the passengers are not offered a full compensation for the accommodation expenses that occurred. In case WIZZ AIR is unable to perform the cancelled flight due to their lack of spare machines and makes people look for which flight there are any free seats left (limitation of their aircraft and service), they should take over all days the passengers are forced to book a hotel for!

We have been charged additional 35 euros per passenger, at the airport because we didn't check in online. When you book the ticket (and I have booked so many times flight tickets with different companies), there is not any message saying that the self check in online is mandatory. The way of wording for the online check in, is similar to the rest companies as usual saying that :the online check is available two or some days before the flight and if you like you can check in online by yourself to avoid the waiting time at the airport, but nowhere is clearly stating that you must check in by yourself. This is too obvious, that the company is just trying to find ways to earn additional money. It would be way better, to just increase your fares and include the implicit services within the fare. This is the most ridiculous charge I have ever paid to an air company. Other than that, we have been advised that our cabin luggage couldn't been carried onboard the plane to the normal cabin storage place, because we didn't book our ticket with priority boarding and there should be an extra charge if we wanted to take our luggage with us.

765,M Baker,United Kingdom,2018-11-01,2,"Today, I had THE worst experience of my life on Wizz Air. I arrived early for boarding so that I could find room for my backpack in the overhead compartment - which I did. I then took my row 'C' aisle seat. After boarding was completed, I was made to remove my backpack by the stewardess and force it under the seat in front of me. My backpack is large, flexible and within Wizz Air's size limits, but placing it there meant that there was no room left for my feet. (See photos). I could not place my feet outside in the corridor area, either as it would have tripped other passengers who were walking and blocked the food trolleys. I had no choice but to place my feet under the metal braces in the seat in front, meaning that every time the passenger in front moved in his seat, my foot would get crushed. By the end of the flight my foot was bruised, and I was in pain, simply because my bag was too large to fit under the seat, and it should have been left in the over head compartment. Upon pointing this to the stewardess who instigated this episode without any consideration of the consequences, she told me to write to Wizz Air and complain, and that there was nothing she could do. It may be that Wizz Air will read this and decide to reply, stating that shortly larger bags, such as the one which I had to remove mine for will not be allowed without an extra fee. However, that is not the point. At the time of my journey, this was allowed, and. Wizz Air provided zero safe foot space. My bag was also too large to fit under the seat in front, and should have stayed in the overhead locker. Additionally, as my bag was too large to fit the seat in front, it was blocking the emergency escape route of the passengers sitting in the window and middle rows. This is dangerous, and I believe against passenger air transport safety rules. There were also a couple of other, issues regarding hygiene. I noticed that the toilets were cleaned by cabin crew, without wearing gloves, using paper towels from inside of the toilets. First the seat was wiped, then the sink and finally the same towel was dropped on the floor and the floor was wiped using the shoes. The stewardess then pick up the papers from the floor using her hands and flushed them down the toilet. After this, and without washing her hand, she walked to the food trolley and started serving food to passengers, touching coffee cups, water bottles, serviettes and sandwich wrappers. This has to be the worst case of hygiene which I have ever come across, and I would not trust any food served on this airline. I also noticed that the headrests on the seats had grease marks on them, as the paper headrests were missing. The Velcro exists to hang the headrests from, but in order to save costs, it seems like Wizz Air have decided not to care about this item either. I have travelled on Wizz Air on numerous occasions in the last 10 years or so (about 10 times this year alone), however the service has reduced dramatically, the prices have any rocketed (they are often more expensive than national carrier National carriers) and the staff's attitude to customers is simply atrocious - possibly due to their fast expansion.

767,G Huang,France,2018-10-23,1,"Budapest to Nice. We arrived to the Budapest airport with one checked bag that I had paid online together with the ticket reservation. Upon arriving at the checkin counter, they asked for our boarding passes which I didn’t have since I planned to do it at the counter with the baggage drop-off. They directed me to another counter which turned out to be a counter for extra fees. The guy there mentioned that I was supposed to do the online checkin beforehand so I had to pay 194€ extra fee to the 4 of us.  Once we approached the boarding gate, one woman stopped me and asked me to put my hand luggage inside the measurement box. It turned out to be bigger and didn’t fit inside. She then asked me to pay a fee of 75€ extra. I also had a small backpack for my laptop and camera which she said was too much. I said that I would give it to my mom since there were 4 of us. She then stopped us all and forced us to squeeze all our stuffs (even food, clutches for money/passports/boarding passes) inside 4 hand luggage only (including the one I had already paid 75€ for). 3 out of these 4 luggage were to be put to the side of the cargo separate from us since the plane was full.

777,P Andrews,United Kingdom,2018-10-03,1,"Wizz Air used to be a small airline with nice fares and helpful and friendly staff. They have recently expanded in a short period of time, and I believe this is where the problem lies. I have had 3 errors while making three different bookings in the last 2 months. I travel between university and home approximately every 2 months, and sometimes my family visit so you can imagine, there are a lot of bookings. No benefits whatsoever - no collecting airmiles, no benefits for frequent travellers. You have to buy a membership to get cheaper flights but nothing apart from that. The website is ridiculous. For example, last month (Sept 2018), I used my bank card for a booking and at the end of the transaction, I received an error notification that the bank card did not work and I was instructed to repeat my transaction again. A phone call came and I did not manage to try immediately. 2 minutes later, I receive an email with a summary of my booking because the transaction was actually complete! So luckily, I had not tried a second time. Another example (Sept 2018) is when I tried to add 2 suitcases to an inbound flight. But instead, they were added to the outbound flight! That is 2 suitcases of 20kg, so I am still waiting for my refund of almost £50. No emails from Wizz Air yet.

The flight was delayed with 1 and half hours without any good reason (the weather was good, other flights were on time). The arrival hour should have been at 2am in the night and they landed at 3am. Before boarding, they changed the gate 3 times. Then, also before boarding, they labeled the cabin luggage randomly and by force: I told them that I want to take with me in the cabin and that it was very small luggage, below the maximum limits for cabin luggage. They didn't care and lied that it will not necessary go to drop off, the flight attendant will hold them only if there will be no more space in the cabin. It was a lie because we were among the first to board and they took the luggage to the drop off. The places for luggage in the cabin were almost empty near our seats, so it was only mockery what they did. Besides that we had to wait at 3:30am half an hour for the luggage. Another problem is that the space in the seat is too small. I have 1.7 meters height and I stood with my knees stuck in the front seat. I cannot imagine how taller persons can fly 3 hours in that tiny place. Conclusion: never, ever flight with this joke of company, they have the absolute worst service I ever experienced.

789,Andrew Bradshaw,United Kingdom,2018-09-15,1,Absolutely abysmal service. Travelled with my partner and friend from Luton to Larnaca and return. My friend requires assistance on and off the aircraft. The airport staff were fantastic but the airline insisted that he must sit at the back of the aircraft in a centre seat despite the fact that he had paid priority with an extra leg room seat. The priority boarding at Luton and Larnaca was an absolute insult to intelligence. 5 lanes of check in for standard fare and one lane for priority. The entire flight was checked in before the priority queue had moved. Priority boarding is only priority through the gate and not boarding the aircraft. My friend ended up foregoing any assistance to board the aircraft In order to keep his extra leg room seat as he would have been in a great deal of discomfort over a 4 hour flight. As a business traveller flying around 50 times a year I have never witnessed such poor service.

The next day I went to the airport about 3 hours before departure, queued up at the check-in desk, only to be refused a ticket because “I had not checked in online”. I was told in no uncertain terms that unless I paid 35 EUR I would be denied boarding. The fact that their website did not work and that they had not at any stage advised of the need to check in – unlike Ryanair (who emailed and texted me a day before the flight), did not serve any purpose and I was forced to pay. As Wizz doesn’t do customer service, their pathetic attempt to respond to my complaint was left to customer service whose final attempt to look into my complaint said “We would like to kindly inform you that we have done a thorough investigation and we are delighted to inform you about the reason, why you were requested to pay at the airport”.

What we did not expect is what happened to all of us and needs to be addressed immediately. We checked in only to be told that we had not ""checked in online"" 3 or more hours before, so each of us would have to pay an additional 35 EUROS to get a seat. All 15 of us were charged this.

To date - and two calls later - the airline claims to have paid the refund into my account, but I can find no record of a payment; airline informs me I have to get a statement from my bank that the funds had not been received.

815,Michael Herrera,United States,2018-07-24,1,"Budapest to Madrid. Wizz Air flight 2351 on Wednesday, July 18 left 6 hours 28 minutes late. During that time we were on the plane for four hours, during which time a passenger deplaned for ""family"" reasons, an extensive security check was done on belongings in the plane, more passengers wanted to deplane (apparently scared by the extensive security check) and then everyone had to deplane. We were hardly instructed on where to go on the way back to the terminal, ""go up the stairs"", and given no prior instructions on how re-boarding was to take place. In the commotion, five passengers, including me were left stranded in Budapest. For Wizz Air, we were automatically to be blamed, and had to pay for a new ticket if we wanted to reschedule. Perhaps the smart passengers stayed standing in front of the departure screens, but I was told that the plane was expected to take off at 11 PM. After missing dinner and not drinking for hours, I needed to sit down and try to cancel my Madrid hostel reservation online. Then much earlier than expected I heard an announcement. That was the only boarding announcement although two authorized agents stated that ""many"" were given. It didn't look like any information was given on the screens. The five that took a few minutes more to respond to the announcement could not pass a barrier that was no longer successful in reading boarding passes. There were no agents around that could help. Looking everywhere we asked an orange-clad worker to find someone who after his second call on his cell phone told us we were lucky, that we just had to wait right there at that spot because the airline had to change the crew. But, alas, nobody came for us. Then, to add insult to injury, we were told we had to pay again to reschedule. The other four did that. I refused and tried making all contacts possible to ask them to reconsider. After all, I would have expected that would be the correct thing to do. At this point I have plenty of reason to believe that I will not get my money back, like many before me. If I do, it may only be because I paid with a credit card and my credit card company comes through to protect me. No way I would ever recommend this airline.

822,Tony Wheeler,Australia,2018-07-15,2,"Recently took a Wizz flight from Luton to Bucharest in Romania, not an enjoyable experience.  Paid extra to take a suitcase, paid extra to reserve seats, paid extra to get priority boarding as my wife had a temporary mobility problem. Also checked in on line to ensure a trouble free departure and booked our cab to arrive early so we could get through and enjoy a coffee while we waited for departure.  So you would thing I did everything right? How wrong was I! On arrival at the Wizz Air check in, the queue was several hundred passengers deep, I pointed out to an official that all we needed to do was check in 1 bag ""join the queue"" was the terse reply. 55 minutes later, we finally arrived at the check in to be told that our on line check in did not apply, and we had to go the whole procedure again. Wizz Air did not have have enough staff at the check in counters. While 12 desks were ""open"" only 6 were manned....absolutely pathetic service. The end result was a rush to the departure gate, only to find that everyone was ""herded"" into a departure lounge that had seating for less than 10% of passengers. Priority boarding passengers were lined up outside the terminal and had to wait in the hot sun (it was an unusually warm English day) while the delayed incoming aircraft was refueled, resulting in several having to force their way back through the queue to get some shade. Altogether a complete shambles. What about the flight I hear you say! The cabin crew were awesome, friendly and helpful. The flight itself was what you would expect from a budget airline, skinny back uncomfortable seats, no in flight entertainment despite a 3 hour flight and of course you have to pay extra for all food and drink. All is not lost though!

830,W Jackson,United States,2018-07-05,1,"Vienna to Rome. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. Here are 3 reasons why: 1) They Charge you for everything. I mean everything. If you don’t have checkin completed before you get to the airport it costs $40 to get one there so you can fly (not an exaggeration). Printing the little piece of paper costs literally as much as the airplane ticket. In addition, there website is so sneaky and tricky that they won’t send an email asking you to confirm or anything. They will make it incredible you difficult to do so they can steal some more money. I had 5 different flights on this trip from several airlines and this was the only one I could not figure out how to check in and spend $40 on that. Also expect to get charged extra if you have any extra bags at all: purse, hand bag, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if you got charged for entering the plane with gum in your mouth. 2) Staff will treat you poorly. Aside from being charged for everything and nit pick on everything; there is no management in the building to talk to if you have an issue b/c the company is so small they have to hire an outside source at the airport. The staff treats you like criminals checking everything and looking for any little thing they can charge you with. From there you’ll be driven on a bus shuttle to the plane. Literally they are some stingy that you have to sit in the back of the bus if you are not priority. This doesn’t even matter, but it’s just that type of scroungy feel to the whole experience that makes it misserable. 3) They delayed the flight twice overall. I’ve flown about probably 10 or 15 times to places all over the world. I have had some great ones and some rough ones, but this is by far the worst. I will probably never fly with Wizz Air again and I encourage anyone else reading this review to do the same.

836,C Shumin,United Kingdom,2018-06-06,1,"Luton to Tirana. I want to start off by saying that I am not a picky flyer. If an airline takes me from point a to point b safely, then I am satisfied. With this in mind, I never thought I would have such a dreadful experience with an airline. On the first leg from Tirana to Luton, I tried to check in via the Wizz Air app, however it explicitly said that I could not check in online due to regulations from Tirana's airport. I went to the check in counter the day of the flight and I was harshly told by a Wizz Air employee to pay the charge or leave the airport, even though I was clearly explaining to them that checking in online was purely impossible- they refused to listen. The first absolute scam from this airline. The second leg was an even more dreadful experience. Before boarding a woman started interrogating all passengers like she was a prison warden about the number of carry on bags they had. I was fine, however there were people who were forced to pay cash on the counter, just for carrying a lap top in their hands. Second absolute scam. The flight was supposed to take off at 6 a.m UK time, but it took off at 7:30 a.m. The reason was ""a missing oxygen bottle"" which had to be delivered from Gatwick Airport. To add to the misery, we were left to wait not even inside the terminal, but in the stairs leading to the tarmac, for about an hour. The air was humid and I started having difficulty breathing. Many older people had to lie down on the ground, and many children started getting ill. It seemed like a scene from an apocalyptic movie - at 6 a.m on a Tuesday morning in London! The flight itself was alright. I want to point out that the captain of the flight, an Irish gentleman, fully deserved the title as he apologised profusely on behalf of a ridiculous airline. Nothing but respect for him. Every single other Wizz Air employee, particularly the ground crew needs to take some lessons not just on their jobs, but also on basic human decency.

We tweeted Wizz air asking for an update and they sent us a link to a website that said our planes original take off time? Helpful- I think not.

We landed just before 11.30pm and our check-in for our apartment stops at midnight. So we abandoned our original transfers to get a taxi so that we could arrive with 5 minutes to spare otherwise we'd have had to sleep on the street. We thought this might be a one off. But no.

855,Earl Husted,United States,2018-04-12,1,"Budapest to Bucharest. Our difficulties started long before we went to the airport. I noticed at home when I reviewed our ticketing information was that no seats were assigned. So I went online and discovered that to select seats you had to pay for any seat on the plane. Since it was only a bit over an hour flight we decided to let them randomly select our seats even if the three of us, including our 12 year old daughter, were not seated together. A few days before the flight I again went online and attempted to check in. The first section of check-in covered two items: the need to pay to have even one bag checked in (at the rate of $50 per bag) and their rule that there was no guarantee that you could even take one carry-on unless you were willing to pay $6 Euros per passenger for a pass - which supposedly also allowed you to board early. Since we had three bags to check-in and three bags to carry-on I paid over $170 online in order to avoid paying a higher price (as noted in the online check out info) at the airport. The next section of the online check in asked me to select our seats - again at a price. Already upset at the outrageous check-in bag cost I opted not to select a seat and the web site booted me out. I assumed I would just check-in at the airport counter and find out what seats were assigned to us by the airlines. Imagine our surprise when we were informed by the clerk at the counter that we had failed to complete the check-in process and therefore he could not issue tickets. He directed us to another Wizz Air counter down the hall where we were told that our failure to complete the online check-in process would cost us 40 Euro per passenger (120 Euros total) - we had no other option but to pay the 120 Euros. We then returned to the ticket counter and finished checking in. When we arrived at the gate we discovered that the $6 Euro pass we had purchased for each of us allowed us to board early - ya, right, on the bus which then took us to the plane. We stood in the bus for over 30 minutes waiting to be taken to the plane. Once the bus arrived it was a mad house getting off the bus and trying to board the plane. We noticed that most of the other passengers had brought not one but two carry-ons with them. We could have avoided paying the $50/bag cost of checking in our three bags.

Of course that's not told til you purchase the ticket. They know many people won't have a printer in hand or simply will not know so. Unfortunately for them now they had to offer online checking instead, but they make you regret of it as you have to work feeling endless camps (only left asking where our mothers work for each passenger). I avoided that but then comes the flight. Flight got delayed as when boarding people was unboarded without info and rude manners on some ground personnel. In the end over 2 hours delay due to technical problems (but it could be whatever) When boarding with our baby (9 months) although we carry a Yoyo/Baby Grace babycar and its specifically for flying on cabin (that's why we bought it and even in other lowcost never posed problems) after a long discussion they made us to put it down as usual luggage.  The senior cabin crew didn't have any idea of her job about this. Sits can not be bended even 1cm.

861,C Deazan,United Kingdom,2018-04-02,2,"Budapest to Luton. While on holiday I got an automated text from Wizz Air saying my flight had been changed and I would have got an email with my new flight details. There was no email, and my account showed I was still on the same flight. Looking on Facebook, a lot of people had this issue and Wizz Air admitted (on Facebook, where not many people would check) that the text was sent in error. This is after lots of people (according to their comments on Facebook) spent lots of money calling their premium number to check what happened to their flight (many waiting upwards of half an hour and many not even getting through!). I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane. We waited, standing, on the bus for over half an hour before it took us to the plane. What's worse (not for me, but for the Priority passengers) is the other buses left before us so ours actually got to the plane second last! Priority were the first to the bus and amongst the last on the plane. Aside from being fast-tracked through security at Budapest (which had no queue anyway), I saw no evidence of Priority adding anything. Once on the plane, staff were nice and obliging, and the plane was clean. Food is expensive but you can bring your own from the airport. Tea is 2.5 Euros but you can ask for extra hot water for free. The pilot gave detailed information on the route and weather.

After canceling my flight, it's almost impossible to get a response from them in order to obtain the compensation I am entitled to. At the airport, the flight seemed to be delayed somewhat. At 9:45 am I got a message saying the flight had been canceled and I could rebook another one, with no further information. I tried to get information online but the WiFi had crashed under the increasing amount of people in the airport. After waiting in line at the information desk they told me they had no information at the time, but that the airport was closed and it wasn't due to the weather. When asking why the airport was closed, she simply replied: ""I can't tell you"", hinting that she knew, but I wasn't supposed to. After waiting around around for half an hour or so, they finally announced that we were allowed to leave the airport. I asked what that entailed exactly considering they were saying the flight hadn't been officially canceled, and they said I had to sign in order to receive further information. I asked to read the letter first, but they declined. I signed and received a letter in Hungarian which nobody was able to translate for me. Next they put me on a bus and dropped me off at the departure again. I was told to get in line where I'd paid the exorbitant airport check-in fee of 35 EUR earlier. It was a huge line which was hardly budging. Due to the enormous amount of people, I spent 2.5 hours waiting in line. When I got to the front, the lady told me she had no information. When I asked if there was anyone from Wizz airlines to talk to, she said she didn't know, and I had to queue up at the information desk which had a line of similar length.

904,Sharon Ben Porath,Israel,2017-10-07,2,"✅ Verified Review   Tel Aviv to Bucharest. Not really low cost! Bad service turned it into a very expensive (and frustrating) experience for me and my family! I traveled with my wife and two children to Romania, and we were denied boarding at the gate of the flight back from Bucharest to Israel, because of overbooking. No matter how much we argued and insisted, we were refused. I must emphasized that at any stage there was no call for volunteers to give up boarding, as the EU regulation require in case of overbooked flights, before performing involuntary denial of boarding. The staff member at the gate told us that they are missing one seat, so 3 of us can travel. We explained that we cannot split. Only after we got back to the ticket office at the departure flights counters we were told that we are entitled only for a single denied boarding, as the 3 others had seats and chose not to fly. We had to buy new flight tickets for the next day in a different airline, as Wizz Air had no seats available in the following days. These one way tickets cost us more than the entire round trip with Wizz Air (although it was with another low cost airline). We had to pay for hotel another night, meals, transportation etc. I submitted a complaint and sent copies of all required documents and receipts. It took more than a month for Wizz Air customer service to respond, and their feedback is that they are willing to compensate me for denied boarding of only a single passenger. They provided very limited compensation for the other passengers. The overall compensation Wizz Air agreed for is €984, while my overall expenses caused by this denial of boarding was €2,426. Seriously, Wizz? We know that airlines overbook the flights, but compensate properly your customers when they are harmed by it! At least reimburse the actual extra expenses caused, I am not even talking about compensation for the frustration and trouble. Follow the regulations and ask for volunteers before you perform involuntary denial of boarding! Don’t split up families! If you deny boarding from a member of a family under a single reservation, compensate the entire family! None of us wanted to stay there.

When saving money isn't worth it, we all want a bargain but sometimes it's better to shell out a bit more than save money for an awful service. I booked a getaway on Groupon so if anyone reading this is in the same boat then I urge you to reconsider. Flying to Budapest the flight was delayed an hour and change with nothing resembling an explanation given, luckily the flight wasn't full so I could stretch out some but I could tell it would be uncomfortably cramped if anyone was sitting next to me, and I'm only 5'11 so I shudder to think how anyone over 6ft would fare. Then returning we find out much to out chagrin that we had to check in online, bear in mind no-one saw fit to inform us of this, not Groupon, the airline or the company we booked it through. And to make it worse me and my girlfriend were seated at opposite ends of the plane. The ground staff were of no help, not even attempting to help us find a solution let alone sympathise with our problems. So in summary, this airline may be cheap but if you have even a modicome of care for the pleasantness of your journey then I cannot recommend enough paying slightly more and flying with a reputable airline and I'm including easy jet and Ryanair so that should tell you something.

Since check in is done well in advance, and since I did not check in any luggage, I could pass the long lines and go directly to security. This was very convenient. If you don't want to pay extra you can only carry a small bag at this airline, but they make that very clear even in their advertisement, so it can hardly be a surprise for anyone. What is more annoying is that you cannot choose seats at check in without having to pay extra. Consequently I was placed in a middle seat, even though the aircraft was only half full. But the person next to me moved away quickly so I could move to the aisle seat. Seat comfort was not too bad, the seatbacks could not be reclined, but being tall I find it more annoying if people in front of me recline their seatbacks without looking back. The catering on board was very uniinteresting, and for someone who does not eat gluten there was hardly anything available. But I had brought my own food, so that was not a problem. All in all the flight was pleasant enough, and even though we were a bit delayed at departure we arrived in time.

There we got coupons for a meal, the Ryanair passengers did not receive this.

Ryanair organized buses to the train station. Overall information on the airport was rather minimal, I don't know if this is accountable to Wizz or to the Airport.

Food and drink selection available was also good, if expensive, but that's to be expected. The team on the ground however seemed useless and very unorganised. At the Glasgow end, check in opened late, meaning a massive queue and minimum time to get through security and to the gate. Coming home from the Budapest end the organisation was non-existent. There were about 8 Wizz Air flights all due to leave within a relatively short time. Instead of forming queues for each separate desk, one queue was to be formed for all of them - a total shambles. This led to a bottle neck of people trying to even get into the queue, not a safe situation at all! They were the only company offering a direct flight from Glasgow on the days we needed, and were therefore our choice. For a budget airline the price we paid was way OTT.

In their defence I will say they advise you when you are buying the ticket and days before you arrive to the airport, but it does not avoid people being charged by £60 that are complaining and slows the queue to get into the plane. Once onboard you can easily realise how small the seats are, they are incredibly tiny even in comparison with other low cost like Easyjet or Jet2.com, even Ryanair have bigger seats.

The thing was that if you paid 45 euros per bag you were able to take your hand luggage with you on board, otherwise the option was to pay 65 euros per bag and put them on the hold of the aircraft what it is more than understandable as many airlines advise you to do it online when you buy your ticket if you have luggage to check in, but that it wasn't the case.

967,S Simpson,Denmark,2017-04-16,1,"✅ Verified Review   I've flown with all the low cost carriers - but Wizz Air is by far the worst. To start, the price as advertised was impossible. I'm used to surcharges - but they've even invented a difference between small and large cabin luggage, effectively forcing you to buy some additional luggage, even for weekend trips. Added costs not only for checked-in luggage - for for the usual cabin bag. Next, check-in. I arrive at Billund, there are no check-in machines. Arriving at the check-in counter (where the three couples before me in the queue were all shown off for having too large luggage), I am told that if they are to check me in (I did not do it online, I never do, but I am not late or anything), it will be an extra cost. Nothing had been mentioned about this in emails from Wizz Air. At both the check-in counter and the ticket office, where I am sent, they refuse responsibility in the usual weak agency manner, we're not Wizz Air, we're just airport reps. The final cost for checking in two hours before is DKK 270 (incl 30 in airport fee) - around 25% extra on the ticket price. It will be the same again, if I don't check in on the return leg. The feeling that they will milk you for every surcharge they can is pervasive. Inside the flight, the leg space is the narrowest I've experienced, even on low cost airlines, and the airplane is just generally dirty. The staff service was courteous, although of course food and drinks must be paid for.

I use this route (Eindhoven to Brno) and carrier a lot, and I love it. Both airports are rather small and super convenient. You don't need to be there hours before departure, in Brno 40 minutes is enough, for Eindhoven I suggest 50 minutes when you fly in the morning. Of course, it is a low cost carrier, so there is no inflight entertainment and you have to pay for your drinks. Furthermore, you have to pay for a large hand luggage. But if you are aware of this, it is perfect. I normally take my backpack and its more than enough. When you are expecting to fly more often with Wizz, you can join the Wizz discount club, it will cost you 30 euros a year and it is beneficial when you fly more than twice a year with them. The flight itself was perfect, staff was not extremely over friendly but just friendly. I got empty seats next to me and I was allowed to change to the window seat.

Much worse than Ryanair or easyJet. Unfortunately I'm stuck with being their frequent flyer. I got delayed 10 out of 22 of my trips last year, also the delay information is always communicated last minute so it's almost impossible to plan ahead and not get stuck in the cramped airports. They have a record breaking turnaround time of 30 minutes, during which people have to disembark, the aircraft needs to be cleaned and new passengers have to board. Of course the planes are dirty with food leftovers and stains everywhere. Staff look overworked and disconnected. In winter they like to check the boarding pass and let you stand outside in the cold until they finish chucking away the trash (LTN airport). I really dread flying Wizz and I would alway prefer overpaying at the airport for food, water to not give any extra money to this greedy company.

989,J Vickers,United Kingdom,2017-01-17,2,"✅ Verified Review   We were extremely disappointed with the service on our way back to Glasgow from Budapest in December 2016 with Wizz Air. We purchased extra services - such as priority boarding, which was not provided - we were all squeezed into a bus. The driver was not present, the engine was off, the heating was off - we were left waiting outside for 20 minutes (I am in my mid 20s, I was fine standing, but what about elderly passengers?) on a freezing cold bus. Let me point out, the flight is at 6.20 in the morning, so the outside temperature is below freezing. There were no staff at the bus who we could have raised our concerns with. While boarding the staff did not care about maintaining lines / queues / checking priority boarding details, we paid extra and had to queue behind a whole bunch of people without PB to eventually be squeezed into a cold bus. This wasn't my first time flying Wizz, my overall opinion is that the Staff at the airports are not motivated at all - I would even say that they could not care less about the passengers. The organisation of the boarding process is awful, we were met with a rude attitude - especially from the ground handling staff. Obviously this is a low-cost airline, so you are prepared to have some inconveniences, such as small leg room, extreme departure times, ridiculous baggage policies etc. I have flown with Wizz 5 times in the past 18 months - as it is the only direct flight between Glasgow and Budapest, however after the horrific experience last time we have decided to fly KLM via Amsterdam. Would like to point out, the cost is the same, or even cheaper, considering the same hand luggage allowance and the lay over is just about 2 hours at Schiphol.

Was booked on a Wizz flight from Varna (Bulgaria) to Luton on 29th December. The flight was cancelled. Not the fault of Wizz Air (or so we were told), as it was a weather problem. The problem was that Wizz decided not to tell anyone. We were all booked in and sitting in departures waiting for the flight. The departure board still showed an on time take off. About an hour or so later the departure board suddenly changed to 'Cancelled'. No announcement, no information of any kind and not a single member of Wizz Air staff to be seen. It was just a pathetic shambles and got worse. Now well over a week from the cancelled departure and still waiting for a refund, or at least the common courtesy of a response to my claim. They are keeping my money, paid in good faith for something they did not provide. I tried to contact their so called 'Customer Service' but this was a total waste of time.

Well, that was in theory - skipping the fact of difficulties with communicating in English with the stewardess, she informed a ""service"" like that is not included in the price of cheap flights and if I'm feeling too nervous about the flight, the crew will be forced to make me leave the plane.

In all the years I've travelled this route there was 1 (one) serious delay (over one hour), all other departures were roughly on time and arrivals often well ahead of scheduled time. The bottom line with Wizz is a simple one - you should be well prepared for all aspects of your trip and strictly adhere to their luggage/boarding pass rules (which seem to cause the most confusion but are all readily available to consult on their website in many languages) and you'll have absolutely no hassle. Measure your luggage by dimension and weight and, if in doubt, purchase it online, don't leave it for the airport. Always print your own paper boarding pass. Other than that, the seats are non-reclining, pretty hard and tight, the legroom is very restricted unless you purchase it as an extra but the planes are mostly brand new and reasonably clean. The cabin crew is occasionally a little blasé and aloof but far from unpleasant, and most of the time the service is quite satisfactory.

At this point we had an hour to get to the airport but had to collect other people on the way, we did not start the journey until 17:20.

996,A Dranovich,United Kingdom,2016-11-08,2,"✅ Verified Review   Luton to Bucharest. Flight itself and service inflight were fine. I'm writing to complain about the ridiculous business model of this airline. Our outbound flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, which shifted our plans around which meant we had to cancel one hotel, book another, and meant we paid for an extra day of our car rental that we didn't need. However this delay did not qualify for any compensation from the airline. On the inbound flight, we tried checking in online on our way to the airport, like many reasonable people do - but found out they have created an arbitrary window that if you check in less than 3 hours before your flight, you have to pay 35 euros per person. So in summary, Wizz Air delaying our flight and making us have to re-arrange hotels and our plans for the first day of our trip means they owe us nothing, but if I try to do something as basic as check in for the flight I already paid for, I have to pay an additional 35 Euro (70 Euro for my girlfriend and I together). On top of that, if you want to call them to complain about it, they charge you 1.3 Euros/minutes.

When I got to the airport I was informed that I was in fact not 'fully' checked in because I had not printed out my boarding pass. When I tried to say that I had checked in online and was given a seat, I was informed that this mistake occurred to passengers all the time and that only passengers travelling with Wizz Air frequently, avoided penalties. The fine for not printing out the boarding pass was about 30EUR each. When I asked how someone could support such a scam I was told by the neighboring ticket agent that if I made any more comments I would not be able to board the plane. Finally anyone saying that the seat comfort is ok in their review is lying - at least on the planes between Poland and Norway.

1011,H Sigurdsson,Iceland,2016-09-29,8,"✅ Verified Review  Keflavik to Budapest with Wizz Air. This is a low cost carrier and this review is based upon the understanding that you know what that means and my ratings would be lower if it was a full service airline. Having said that I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Wizz Air again. Their website makes it clear what you get with a barebones ticket. A seat and small cabin luggage. Want anything beyond that and you have to pay for it. We actually went for added check-in luggage and as this was partially a shopping trip, more allowance on the way back from Budapest. You do need to make sure you understand that 30 days in advance you can check-in for your flight. That's when you should as that will give you the best options when picking your seats. We didn't get this so had to make do with somewhat less than optional seating, but it worked out in our favour actually. So this is a late afternoon flight out of Iceland. Check-in was efficient, but when we entered the terminal many food options had closed. As it turned out when flying to Budapest so had most of the food on the plane. The plane felt new and shiny. Seats OK, you can't lean back at all. This is actually somewhat better as I found it easier to get in and out of the seatrow. Cabin staff were lovely, they look like they enjoy what they are doing and apologized for the lack of food options. But the Hungarian beer and red wine are both to be recommended. Now in Budapest check-in was again efficient and the airport is fantastic. Definitely one of the best in Europe with great variety of shopping/food options. However, the check-in to the aircraft made me feel a bit like cattle being led to the barn. But it worked. Flight back to Iceland was smooth. Crew again looking happy to be at work and at the end of the day I would definitely both fly with and recommend Wizz Air as a great low cost carrier option, if not yet on the Norwegian level.",A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,KEF to BUD,September 2016,3.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,,4,yes,False,KEF,BUD,,Positive,0.9953,  verify review keflavik budapest air low cost carrier review base upon understand know mean rating low full service say hesitate fly air website make clear get barebones ticket seat small cabin luggage want anything beyond pay actually go added luggage partially shop trip allowance way back budapest need make sure understand 30 day advance give best option pick seat get make somewhat less optional seating work favour actually late afternoon iceland efficient enter terminal many food option close turned fly budapest food felt new shiny seat ok ca lean back actually somewhat good find easy get seatrow cabin staff lovely look like enjoy apologize lack food option hungarian beer red wine recommend budapest efficient airport fantastic definitely one best europe great variety option however make feel bit like cattle lead barn work back iceland smooth crew look happy work end day definitely fly recommend air great low cost carrier option yet norwegian level
1012,S Robertson,Malta,2016-09-27,1,"✅ Verified Review  Budapest to Malta with Wizz Air. This airline is a total rip-off. And they didn't even bother to hide or disguise their scam. So you arrive at the airport, check-in and then you go to your gate. The gate for Wizz Air was literally 300m away from the terminal building - you have to walk outside on the airport apron (the tarmac) to get to it. Once there you have to wait until they open the 'gate' - a small hangar. Once opened, the queue was very slow and everyone wondered why. Once our turn came, we realised why. The first thing you see is a counter and a guy checking people's hand luggage dimensions - and the dimensions were tiny. So surprise surprise, many people had to pay 14,000HUF (approx $55) to get their luggage on board. I've been travelling with my small luggage for the past 4 years. I've used countless times on all major airlines, as well as on low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, Easy Jet, Vueling, etc. This was the first time that I had to pay for it!

1013,C Mitchell,Spain,2016-09-26,1,"✅ Verified Review  Flight from Budapest to Madrid with Wizz Air. The airport of Budapest seems to be constantly under construction. We were ushered into a hangar where, at the entrance, there was a member of staff checking our tickets. They would look at your suitcase and your boarding pass, and if they didn't like what they saw, they would confiscate your boarding pass and give it to another member of staff. A group of about 5-10 of us were set aside. There, you were asked to measure your bag by putting into the bag size checker. My suitcase would fit perfectly but it was about 5cm too tall. The staff then used a measuring tape (I'm not kidding) to highlight that my bag was 5cm above their 42x32x25cm requirements for a free small cabin bag. I was travelling with my wife. She has a bigger suitcase than me, so I had paid extra for her luggage, but not for mine which is significantly smaller. Despite me telling them repeatedly that I have never paid extra with other low cost airlines such as Ryanair for either my wife's or my suitcase, that this was a daylight robbery, that I had paid for one bag already, that my suitcase did fit into their size checker, that this was very poor customer service on their behalf - they did not budge. I had to pay 45 euros to take my suitcase with me. I was appalled by this. If 5cm is worth more to them than gaining loyal customers I will not choose to fly with them ever again. That aside, I have to say that there was nothing exceptional about the airplane, crammed to capacity, the service or the food/beverages available onboard.

1016,S Rose,Israel,2016-09-11,6,"✅ Verified Review   Flew Tel Aviv - Vilnius and return in early September with Wizz Air. As we boarded in TLV we were shocked to find out that the aircraft had not been cleaned from the previous flight (VNO-TLV), the floor was dirty and so were the bathrooms. Leg room is ok, but seats do not recline so after two hours, it became very uncomfortable. Crew were very low key and did the minimum with not much else. They sell food and duty free. Tried their cheese sandwich which was poor quality. F/A had no clue as to flying time, she said it would be 3h 10 m to VNO, but it was really 3.45. We were happy to get off. Return flight, they boarded us on time, just to find ourselves in a different holding area for another 20 min without seats. Why? Who knows. Why not keep us at the gate seated until AC is ready? Older people, families with children, all cramped together for 20 min in a stairway. I guess not much respect for their guests. Again boarded an Aircraft that was not clean from previous flight. What kind of feeling do Wizz expect you to have boarding a dirty plane? I guess they don't care. You can be low cost and clean btw. Again crew did the minimum, no interaction with passengers, this time no information at all from the pilots, no routing info, flying time etc. This time we stayed away from the food trolley. Tickets were not that cheap either, more than 300 euro RT. All in all Wizz brought us home safe and sound, and that's the main thing. The journey itself and the product were quite poor.

Once they did, they turned everyone around without giving any information, except for the plane not being ready.

This is when we found out that the plane never departed from Wroclaw (it was supposed to fly to Birmingham then back) and the flight is being cancelled. Not from the people that were supposed to help us or give out information. My dad gave them a call in Poland as the flight was long cancelled to find out that the plane has a technical issue.  All of the passengers had to go through a single service desk. 200 people. 1 desk! The Wizz Air customer service representative loudly exclaimed that he is not going to deal with anyone and will go home if people do not stop asking questions without waiting in line. It was around midnight already and many people did not not know what was going on, lots of them had no way to get home at this hour. Customer service was horrible, they just gave out ""your rights"" forms with a grumpy look on their faces without answering questions. We had the right to reschedule a flight to some other airport at the closest possible date. Wizz Air is supposed to provide shelter, food and transport in these cases. Do you think they did any of that? They don't care about their customers. When I asked them about it they told me to file a complain online. If it wasn't for kind people passing on information between each other, lots of them would not know what was going on. Luckily I came to the airport with my car, so I was able to book a flight at Luton next morning. What about all these people that did not have an option like that? When I got into the car I called the customer service quoting my rights and asking for help regarding my car park and dealing with the cancellation. The guy I called had no clue what to do in situations like these, he was no help at all. I hang up in anger as they charge ridiculous amounts for the calls.  I left the car park, booked another one at Luton and rushed home because the morning flight was at 9am. Thats when I found out that I had a return flight booked back to Birmingham. I called them to get this flight changed as well and they charged me 30 pounds for changing the booking even though I quoted the whole situation. The flight was supposed to take place 3 weeks ago. I still haven't been contacted by Wizz Air to receive my compensation and refund. I called customer support today and they just kept on asking for reference numbers and had no idea which one was correct.

1030,G Landor ,United Kingdom,2016-07-19,1,✅ Verified Review   Vilnius to Luton. Awful. Flew out a few days ago and the flight was over an hour late. My girlfriend took a different flight on the same day and was also delayed. This airline seems to consistently predict flight times that they are aware they cannot meet.

1043,Charlie Rees,United Kingdom,2016-06-01,3,"I am fuming after my trip with Wizz Air. Biggest con and scam of an airline. Not only did they make us pay an extra £30 after booking to sit near (not next to) my partner, (which is okay as sometimes expect this with budget airlines) I experienced the worst customer service on the way home and hope this review helps others avoid the same charges I faced for hand luggage allowance.  On my flight out to Budapest I took my hand luggage on board with no problems.  It was even smaller than my partners shoulder bag in weight and size. On the way back to London, the staff seemed to be stopping every other person to have their bag ""checked"" for measurements. It was here that the staff member took a tape measure and measured my bag to tell me it was 7cm - yes 7cm over their guidelines in height. Despite it fitting in their bag tester stand that most airlines have. They informed me this very specific measurement was in their booking t&c's and that I had to now pay £35 in fees to cover the extra 7cm. Despite the fact that my bag wasnt full and was half the weight of their 15kg allowance, and I flew out with them and no one said anything. I had to pay, and was very polite about it, and then reluctantly got back in the queue to get on the plane - watching about 50 other passengers also having to pay the £35 fee for the same reason. This seemed like the biggest scam and also completely unreasonable, and did not make sense to me.

My problem was when I got to the check in point and was told by the rudest passanger service agent that the name I had on my boarding pass was incorrect and I had to go to the office and change it. The problem is that changing your name will apparently cost you 100€. And my name was in fact right because it was my first and last name and never have I ever been bothered with such a thing. But according to the lady I should also have had my middle name. After further research online and on Wizz Air website I have yet to find any warnings that you are obliged to enter your full name. So I can only say that this is some kind of scamming to get people to pay for yet another fee. I did however manage to pass without changing my name which leads me to believe even more so that it is a scmm.

1052,Joseph Whibley,United Kingdom,2016-04-26,2,"✅ Verified Review   I was unable to do an online check-in due to a glitch with the Wizz Air website. I phoned their free booking query line and was told, yes, there was a problem and that free airport check in had been applied. We flew from Luton with no problem, the check-in was indeed free. On the return, however, no free airport check in had been applied. As I attempted to explain to both airport staff and the Wizzair folk when I phoned them, I couldn't check in for either flight and explained this when I phoned initially. I assumed, wrongly, that free airport check in had been applied to the return flight too. I was told when I phoned that I needed to go through the online complaints department.

1053,S Kavram,Estonia,2016-04-24,1,"✅ Verified Review   Barcelona to Riga. I have flown with numerous airlines and Wizz was the lowest quality one, I ever had. Cabin bag size was strangely small, while booking the ticket and just in case I measured the bag, which was pretty tight between 40-42cm (max, Wizz allows for small bag, is 42cm.) In airport they pulled me over and told to put the luggage in the steel box, they have. So I did and to my great surprise, they insisted, I have to pay, since the wheels are little bit out from the box (not even an inch!) Since I measured the luggage at home with proper measuring line, I insisted they show me the actual length of the box. Of course, now it turns out, this supposedly is not their job, but nonetheless I am forced to pay 40 euros on spot. To make the situation less awkward, they gave me an option, though, which was to leave the bag behind! Lucky for me, I am spot on with the terms and conditions and this was the only thing, I had to pay extra this time, but I saw few people paying ridiculous sums of money just for having online check in and no paper to go with it. Seats on plane couldn't be tilted and the flight attendants go non-stop, selling stuff on isles, so no chance to sleep, unless you are tired to death. No Wifi and media stations, either.

1060,Shane Hosiene,United Kingdom,2016-03-22,1,"I received an email 4 weeks before my travel date to say that my Sofia to Lubeck flight had been cancelled. Initially I was fine with this, but after speaking to their Call Centre I was left very angry and upset with Wizz Air's customer service levels. Firstly, they told me that there were no alternative flights they could offer, which again was not a major problem as I assumed that they would agree to refund my outbound flight from Bristol to Sofia. I was wrong. They refused to offer a refund for the unaffected flight even though I booked both sectors at the same time, and seemed happy for me to fly out to Sofia and leave me stranded there with no way of travelling onwards without paying significantly more money to rebook with a different airline. The call centre agent constantly criticised me for repeating myself which, even if true, is extremely poor service. Ironically, he kept repeating the mantra of 'you will have to complain via the website'. To put this into context, I was refused a refund of just £38 for the unaffected flight which is a very small price to pay to keep a customer happy and to give me the option to rebook alternative flights. As it turned out, the small matter of £38 means that I will never book with Wizz Air again - not because of the flight cancellation (which I can accept) but because of their very poor customer service levels.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SOF to LBC,March 2016,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,False,SOF,LBC,,Negative,-0.9067,  receive email 4 week travel date say sofia lubeck cancel initially fine speak call centre leave angry upset air customer service level firstly alternative flight offer major problem assume agree refund outbound bristol sofia wrong refuse offer refund unaffected though booked sector time seem happy fly sofia leave strand way travel onwards without pay significantly money rebook different call centre agent constantly criticise repeat true extremely poor service ironically keep repeat mantra complain via website put context refuse refund unaffected small price pay keep customer happy give option rebook alternative flight turn small matter mean never book air cancellation accept poor customer service level

1070,Jean Remillard,United Kingdom,2015-12-18,1,"What a painful experience Wizz Air was. First, the web price went up 40% in one day, probably due to the use of cookies, since someone else 10 minutes later had my original price displayed, though this is difficult to prove. As, it now seems, many others, I got caught by the ""small cabin bag"" rule which frankly, is the most stupid thing I heard. Paying more for checked baggage is logical, since there is more handling. But space in the aircraft is debatable: my suitcase is not large, and I have only one, compared with other having a suitcase, a handbag and some shopping to top this up! So on top of the 250 euros price tag (+ CC fees, of course), which is far from ""low cost"", I paid another 40+40 for my so called big suitcase. The seats are squashed, I was sat at 90 degrees for 2.10 hours (not a short flight!), but luckily my neighbor did not show up and I could move to an aisle seat. The staff at the gate or in the plane was not particular friendly, but I would not be happy working for that company and I suppose it would be reflected in my attitude. One of the stewardess seemed in a complete rush to close all the compartments, which made me nervous. There is no inflight entertainment and no wi-fi, but that is expected, I suppose.

Please be informed that no reply will be sent to your enquiry apart from this automatic message. Ok, I'll call the number provided on their website. Call centre is in Hungary, by the way, and calls costs more than £1 per minute. Firstly, too many of them do not speak good enough english, to be able to deal with customers. Secondly, the rudeness is staggering. Absolutely no 'customer service' training whatsoever. After talking to, yet another, extremely rude advisor, she simply hung up the phone, without helping me with my enquiry at all. You ask to speak to supervisor, they refuse.

1094,Alesya Makarova,United Arab Emirates,2015-10-06,1,"My husband and I were disappointed with our WizzAir flight on 24 August 2015 from Sofia to Dubai. We booked this flight on 11 February 2015 (6 months before), and paid an additional 79 Euro each for the Wizz Plus package that includes all the extras. Shortly after our booking, Wizz Air introduced seat allocation and we used the Wizz Air mobile app to choose our seats (as there was no such option on their website). This was the most tedious process: after each seat allocation the app blocked me from further actions because I had to pay 9 Euro, even though this was free-of-cost for the Wizz Plus package holders. I had to call them onto their international Customer Care number after each seat allocation to clear the bill. After we finally managed to allocate the seats, we received the email confirmation from the Customer Relations Department (Wizz Air Hungary) for our reserved seats together on the 1st row. Firstly, when we arrived to the Sofia airport, we were given two completely different to our booking seats (not even together). After showing the confirmation and the email form The Customer Relations Deptartment, the airport staff issued new boarding passes to us for seats 1F and 1E and we proceeded to the security checks etc. Upon boarding we discovered that our seats 1F and 1E were taken by other passengers with the same boarding passes as ours. Obviously those passengers refused to move and we had to be seated at the end of the plane far away from each other as the crew could not do anything and blamed ground handlers at the Sofia Airport. There were several other passengers on this flight facing the same issue (same seat allocation as other passengers), and it was very unfair and caused a chaos before take off. Passengers were still standing unseated while the plane was already moving. This completely ruined the end of our holiday as we had to travel separately for no fault of ours whatsoever. I send the detailed complaint to Customer Relations Department and also placed an official complaint using their website link. I also requested to cancel our upcoming one-way flight with Wizz Air in January 2016 from Sofia to Dubai. Since then I have sent them numerous reminders to respond, raised numerous requests online to follow up on my complaint, even called their ""Customer Care"" who could not or did not want to assist whatsoever and said that the Customer Ralations Department must have been very busy and get back to me ""shortly"". Until today I have not heard from them.
