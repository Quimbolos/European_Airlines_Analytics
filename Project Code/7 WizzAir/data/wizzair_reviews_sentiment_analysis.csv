0,C Marten,United Arab Emirates,2023-11-15,1,"Horrible service, I wouldn’t repeat to take this airline even if it is free. 2 days before our flight they moved it 14 hours later. Our hotel and tours were already set up and we have to cancel the tour and get charged by the hotel for a day. In order to check in early, you need to purchase seats so we did because as per their website it says that they will not accept mobile boarding form. Boarding is not organized, no zones, no priorities so anyone can just go which makes it also difficult to board. Some of the staff are rude and they treat people like they are on the streets and not in the customer service industry. I understood that this is a budget airline but treating people like this is not acceptable. One of the flight attendants on our flight during boarding we reached our seat and were putting up our luggage so some of the passengers were waiting behind us instead of helping us at least to put up the luggage he was shouting and swerving us with his hand to the side telling us “let them pass!, let them pass!”, no manners at all, like really!?. It is not my first time to fly with budget airlines but this by far the most horrible I have experienced! So before taking this airline think first about it. It is cheap yes, but there are extra fees and weird requirements like printing the boarding card to be shown at the airport instead of flight ticket and mind you if you choose airport check-in there is payment also.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Bishkek,November 2023,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,2,no,True,Abu Dhabi,Bishkek,,Positive,0.9337

I am allowed as per my ticket with a carry on bag, mine was literally 7 cm higher than their metal measure (Despite those 7 cm being empty air and malliable/pliable) since I have a soft bag-pack. I understand you make a person pay for 1kg extra or something, but 55$? Which is what any airlines charges for a 23kg bag 4 times the size of this bag! What's worst is they never checked anyone else for the bag size, despite passengers holding bigger bags that mine. Their answer was ""They have air priority"", despite them knowing these passengers were coming in from the same line I came in, not the Priority lane. I asked to check anyone's bag to see if it fits in that impossible small size measuring pocket they have, they refused. Because they knew over 60% of those bags won't pass that test! Then when it came to payment, they don’t accept Euro, Not USD, & didn't accept 228zł & doesn't accept 300zł because they have no change, which is literally 2zł less than the Crazy number they wanted to charge, an amount I could've used to travel with any other decent airline (which I will from now on!).",,Business,Economy Class,Krakow to Larnaca,November 2023,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,no,True,Krakow,Larnaca,,Negative,-0.5657

She needed special assistance and the service was stopped in Saudi Arabia so we had to make international phone calls to Saudi to ask for the service again.

6,Katja Horstmann,Germany,2023-11-06,1,"This airline is an absolute fraud! We had booked a flight with them last summer, only to have our flights cancelled last minute. We were already travelling in another country and were in Venice in summer - not a cheap place to be stranded. We called their Customer Support and were told that we'd be put on the next available flight IN 4 DAYS. We were told that ALL expenses would be paid (as they have to by law) - we clarified several times on this phone call if there was a limit and she said no, as long as not 5* accommodation. Fair enough, so we paid everything out of pocket for 4 days and send the receipts to Wizz Air afterwards. This company has been refusing to pay up and only reimbursed us about 20% of our costs - they deem 336 EUR for 2 people for 4,5 extra days in Venice reasonable. That is 42 EUR per person, per day. In Venice. In summer. For accommodation, food and transportation. We have reached out multiple times requesting to be paid the remaining expenses we incurred due to their flight cancellation AND HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER. They say to go through the ODR, which we did - they had 3 months to respond and never did. Please listen to the original call that was made with your customer support and pay up as you had said you would.

We arrived in Luton and mobbed the arrivals carousel and eventually a wizzair person arrived and said that the pilot was supposed to tell us that our baggage wasn't here. Obviously, he hadn't done that. The poor ground handler did not explain the importance of a PIR (Property Irregularity Form) and that it had to be filled out at the airport terminal. The website does not explain that properly. Of course, that form is not available online and has to be filled out at the airport of arrival. i had to stay two extra days in London (with all of the costs incurred) and I live in Australia and of course Wizz Air does not fly to here. Two days later, I went in a taxi back to Luton Airport to collect my delayed baggage. The ground handlers did not explain the need for a PIR and I flew back to Australia. In order to try and recoup the expenses incurred, I tried the call centres. They call are no help as they say you have to physically go to the airport you arrived at.

If I had known that the seat would have a painful lack of cushioning and that my knees would be pressed into the seat in front I would have paid the £26 for an extra legroom seat. I didn't have that issue with the seat inbound so I suspect it is the window seat plus a broken seat that caused my difficult journey. The flight was full so there was no opportunity to swap seats so I didn't complain about the seat to the flight attendants. As the two people on the outer seats fell asleep almost immediately (and I didn't want to wake them up) I put up with it. I wonder what if anything the FA would do. The service was friendly and helpful from what I have seen. For example, one woman had a large rolling bag that was too wide for the overhead, he assisted her to reduce its shape by using the zipper.

11,P Deane,United Kingdom,2023-10-21,9,"My first encounter with wizzair was with the iPhone app. It is solid, provides many services ancillary to the flight - such as history of flight landing - and allows you to book extra service after the booking. The booking process via the iPhone app was smooth. The charges are transparent, though I don't like how high the bag cost is, so I can compare it with the competition. I generally go with an underseat bag now, whether Ryanair or Wizzair; Aer Lingus alone gives you checked bag included in the low cost seat. Wizzair advised me to turn up 3 hours before departure due to security queue, and I am glad I did as it was a slow process of handling thousands with only 60% x-ray machine operating. We boarded 40 minutes before departure, but took off an hour later. The seats are the most limited in knee room of any of the LCC and this early boarding accentuated this - can you tell I am 6ft? The £10 charge for keeping the booking seats together leads to friends reuniting in the interval before takeoff. I was asked to swap by an attendant to a worse seat which I refused, later I was offered free extra legroom seat. The teens who had paid for these seats weren't allowed to occupy them.

This lack of transparency is unacceptable and left me feeling cheated. The behavior of the boarding staff was utterly disrespectful and unprofessional. Their rudeness towards passengers was unwarranted and created a hostile atmosphere during the boarding process. To make matters worse, when I submitted nine passports for our group's boarding, we were issued with only seven boarding passes. The counter staff simply closed the counter, leaving two of our group members stranded at the airport, with no alternative but to wait an entire day for a flight change. My overall experience with Wizz Air was marred by these significant issues.

I waited until I could afford, then rang the bell to go to the bathroom urgently. No one answered, so I took a few steps from my 34th row to the nearest toilet. At that moment all hell broke loose, the darkness and silence shattered by an authoritarian female voice (""this is not a drill"" model) warning me to immediately return to my seat and threatening to have the police arrest me upon landing. I wish to have just disappeared at the astonished looks that showered me and returned to my seat, within five minutes the emergency sign was closed, the lights turned on, and the cabin crew started pulling trolleys between the rows some 20 minutes before landing. It was a night flight and my impression is that they didn't want to work unless truly necessary, at the cost of harassing passengers.

Above the counter where the giant words ""Check-In""; the irony of not allowing people to check-in at the check-in counter was seemingly lost on all but the passengers who were redirected to a different counter, where we were charged 40 EUR PER PERSON to check-in. As far as I can tell all that happened at this second counter was a payment was made, and then we returned to the ""check-in"" counter 160 EUR lighter, to drop our bags (because we had now already checked in, at a different counter from the check-in counter).

The best happened when we landed in Dammam (Saudi Arabia), being around 240 people in the aircraft approximately 150-200 needed to get a connection flight; however, because the airline apparently doesn't have a contract with the airport, we were all obliged to pay EUR130 for a transit visa, even though none of us would step in the country. This was absolutely ridiculous and we got the explanation from the local authorities that they daily faced that issue of people flying with WizzAir. Nothing was ever explained in the reservations email, which should have been detailed even prior of making the booking. As per my experience it was a given that when you are flying internationally and have everything ready for your next flight you just have to cross de ""International transfer"" door at the airport, however Wizz Air had a wonderful surprise for us.

Online chat is also brushing off all the options that you select and refuses to connect to a live agent.

Had to cancel my trip due to the fact my wife was diagnosed this week with a medical problem that needed immediate attention making us cancel our whole Euro trip due to various doctors visits. Anyway calling WizzAir told us the cancellation fee is 80% or the cost of the tickets, if I have to change dates is about 65% of the original ticket costs. They have no travel voucher to offer to be used later as I asked I need no money back. They offered to “negotiate” the cancellation cost of the ticket if we can provide doctor’s records resulting that my wife cannot travel, this is outrageous as medical records are confidential. Seems that letter from my family doctor was not good enough. Anyway I remained with very bad taste of the inhuman experience this company offered basically taking advantage of peoples unfortunate situation to make some money.

111,R Mears,United Kingdom,2023-06-19,1,"As a frequent traveler who has experienced countless flights with various airlines, I feel compelled to share my recent nightmarish encounter with Wizz Air. This scathing review serves as a warning to fellow travelers who value their time, money, and overall peace of mind. Brace yourself for a tale of incompetence, broken promises, and an utter lack of customer care. Let's begin with the initial offense: the cancellation of our flight without any plausible reason. We got an email the morning of our departure so we rushed to the airport to get some clarity only to be informed that your flight has been abruptly scrapped. Shockingly, Wizz Air failed to provide any legitimate explanation for this cancellation, leaving passengers bewildered and stranded without any clue as to what transpired behind the scenes. Additionally, they didn't have an option for both me and my partner to fly out until 3 days later which wouldn't work because of our work schedules. In a desperate bid for assistance, I reached out to Wizz Air's customer service while at the Palma airport. Little did I know that I was about to embark on an infuriating journey of unhelpful agents and contradictory statements. Despite assuring us that we would be reimbursed if we chose to book an alternative flight outside their company, this turned out to be nothing more than a hollow promise. They had no intention of honoring their commitment, leaving us in a state of financial uncertainty and deep disappointment. Refusing to give up, we sought professional help from an external company, hoping they could navigate the treacherous waters of Wizz Air's reimbursement process. Unfortunately, this only added insult to injury. Nine long and arduous months later, we are still fighting for the reimbursement we rightfully deserve. It is inconceivable that an airline, claiming to value its customers, could display such a blatant disregard for their responsibilities. Wizz Air's inability to provide a backup flight for three days highlights their lack of contingency planning and their disregard for the inconvenience caused to their passengers. Furthermore, their callousness in denying our rightful claim and subsequent inability to fulfill their obligations demonstrates a disturbing level of unprofessionalism and an alarming lack of transparency. Traveling should be an enjoyable and stress-free experience, yet Wizz Air has turned it into a nightmare. Their cancellation without reason, broken promises, and refusal to reimburse the amount we paid for an alternative flight have left us feeling betrayed and disillusioned. It is my sincere hope that this review will serve as a cautionary tale to potential passengers considering Wizz Air, urging them to explore alternative options and spare themselves the agony we endured. In conclusion, I strongly advise against choosing Wizz Air for your travel needs. Their lack of accountability, unreliable service, and poor customer care make them an airline that should be avoided at all costs.

We were told to go to the flight desk, with many other wizz air flights. But at the flight help desk, there was no-one there. No member of staff knew what was going on. We then got told to go to gate 12. So did other flights to different locations.  Not blaming the staff, they had no idea what was going on just like us. No customer service, no information as to why it was all cancelled. As flights to Spain from Wizz still went ahead but Portugal and other Spain flights (from other customers) were cancelled? So what was it? I still don't know.

114,S Gieler,Israel,2023-06-17,3,"I think it's misleading to call this a low-fare. It was nothing but. The first indication of a campy ticket was when booking the tickets for two families I added one large (20kg) suitcase to each family. to my surprise, the cost of adding the luggage was per leg and stood at a whopping $130 per leg, per suitcase. In total, I paid $270 for the suitcase. For comparison, the ticket was $162. Additionally, the advertised ticket price changed while I was in the middle of the booking process and jumped by $20 per passenger. So a projected $140 ticket (already pricey for a 37min. flight!) actually climbed to $252 (in a family of 3). This didn't include advanced check in cost, seat selection cost, and other money grabbing options. But the real shocker was upon return. We got to the ticket counter and expected to drop our luggage and get our boarding passes when we were informed unceremoniously that we needed to pay another 50 Euro per person to be checked in. This happened despite the fact that no such fees were asked for on the way from TLV to Larnaca. The ground team threatened to deny our boarding unless we paid. The confirmation email btw only mentioned that ""If possible, always check in online before leaving for the airport. Otherwise, you might have to pay a fee at the airport."" - no clear language there whatsoever. Nothing in red, no advanced warning via email or sms. only an automated response from the check in rep. The supervisor wasn't offering any help either. We had to run to the other side of the terminal, pay the fees, then run all the way to the gate (threatened with a closed gate) only to be left waiting for the bus to the plane another 20 minutes in a small hall with no AC. Finally, a 20min. delay while on the plane is almost always complementary. The final ticket price then jumped to a little over $300, a truly low-low-fare experience for the price of a full-fare flight. I'd say that unless you're traveling alone, with a small backpack, and have all the time in the world, avoid this company at all cost.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TeAviv to Larnaca,June 2023,2.0,4.0,,,2.0,,2,no,True,TeAviv,Larnaca,,Negative,-0.8472

Some people waited in the spot that the sign said for priority but they were ignored. So they pushed past the line of everyone else and the gate agent helped them next. Which meant the rest of us with priority were left wondering if we should do the same? Chances are half of us had priority and it would feel fair to cut in line because of that. When I asked about where priority was supposed to have been as I was boarding, the lady just shrugged with an exasperated look. It was the most clown show boarding I’ve ever seen. Luckily there was still overhead space but I imagine many priority passengers had a hard time finding space. It shouldn’t be hard to make an announcement to explain what to do.

145,W Hawkins,Australia,2023-04-24,1,"This is the single worst experience with an airline I have ever had. Everything about this was just insane. Promises of 'budget Friendly' were just the start. Me and my partner flew from Athens to Gatwick, £300 with cabin overhead baggage not included? (We are from Australia where this is standard for all airlines) If the tickets were actually budget I would understand. We arrived at Athens airport to find our flight delayed 2 hours. Ok, it's bad having your flight delayed but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since this happens to a lot of airlines. We looked up the aircraft info to find that there was no previous flight. As we waited at the airport we had 5 or 6 different times given to us by Wizz. Once the gate finally opened we made our way. We sat on the ground since seating was not available. Once we were ok to board we were put onto a bus to go to the plane. Once we arrived the driver opened the doors, told us ""don't exit yet"" and so we were left on the bus (packed in very tightly, there are no seats) for 15-20 minutes as we watched the cabin crew cleaning the plane through the windows. Why drive us out if the aircraft is not ready? And the plane has not had a previous flight AND was delayed 2 hours, the plane should have been prepared already? Once we finally got off the bus we were met by what I would find out to be some of the rudest hosts on a plane I have ever met. Every 5 seconds over the PA ""please do not block the aisles to avoid further delays"" to me seemed a bit rich after our experience so far. Also people are boarding, we aren't going to be seated in 3 seconds? When we sat, the aircraft was in a disgustingly awful state. Crumbs are everywhere, rubbish was left in the seat pockets. This aircraft was sitting here at the airport for a long time and the crew had done an abysmal job at preparing for passengers. The flight itself, once we got into the air was ok. Nothing special (they like to push their 'duty free' items on you for purchase, however I found that I could buy most of this stuff at Tesco for half the price). We landed at Gatwick and this is where the true torture began. Passengers stood to collect their luggage. As we were departing, the host grabbed the PA, stared directly into passengers eyes with the most disgusting look I have ever seen from flight crew ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" this was met with passengers fuming, how are we meant to get our luggage down then? He repeated it as I walked towards the front door of the aircraft ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" he proceeded to put down the microphone then step in front of me, put his finger to my face and said ""WAIT"" passengers piled behind me after this man had just told us not to block the aisles. He put his finger down ""ok go"". Me and my partner were livid. The consistent snarky rude comments from this crew was he worst customer service experience I had ever read not just from an airline but from any company I have ever dealt with.

A three hr prior to flight online check-in is required, this rip-off policy Wizz created for their own monetary benefit. When you try to talk to them Wizz hides behind the policy they created and does absolutely nothing. Poor customer service, other people on our flight were upset by the Wizz check-in rip off and being charged extra for their carry on baggage. Heard other passengers comment they fly all the time and this is the only airline that charged them extra for carry on. Wizz doesn’t hesitate to suck every extra penny they can off of you. I would definitely recommend a different airline even if it cost more.

My companion and I had been allocated sears apart which whilst a nuisance was no big issue. However, on boarding we got chatting to a wonderful member of cabin crew who was able to move us into seats together in an emergency exit row. Throughout the flight he, and the rest of the crew were excellent and undertook their job with smile and humour. Our return flight 2 days later, was also excellent. We were delighted to see that the same crew member was once again onboard and he immediately recognised us. He went above and beyond to make our flight comfortable and again move us to seats together. Throughout the flight we were well looked after by all the crew who once again were so friendly, making time to chat with us between duties. The flight deck crew did an excellent job as well keeping us informed of turbulence (we had some nasty turbulence on the way out) and ensuring we were well briefed on the route. Maybe we were lucky but our experiences have been the total opposite of many on here and based on these experiences I wouldn’t hesitate to fly Wizz again.",A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Faro,February 2023,3.0,5.0,2.0,,4.0,,4,yes,True,London,Faro,,Positive,0.9873

187,Mihaea Grigore,Spain,2023-01-12,1,"The experience with this Wizz Flex option is like walking on the street in broad daylight, someone sneaks up on your from behind, extracts 200 Eur from your pocket and walks away. Now the long story: I specifically bought a return flight with Wizz Flex option, in total amount of 260 Eur (212 Eur the actual flight fare and the rest in fees). So I would expect (after reading the Terms & Conditions of Wizz Flex), in the eventuality of asking for refund, to be entitled to 212 Eur back. I postponed the flight once. During this process, the Wizz Air website shows you available dates and after you select the new dates, it computes the price for the new flight and shows you only if there is a difference in price in their favour (if you have to pay something extra or not). I did this, nothing extra to pay, all good here. Later it became clear I will not be able to travel at all, so I went for the second benefit of the Wizz Flex, cancelling and getting a full refund. Surprise: Wizz Air congratulates me for being eligible for a full refund: 40 Eur! At this point I spend more money to call them (the only way to contact is by phone, charge with 1.2 Eur per min), to find out that when I postponed the flight, my refund value was automatically changed to the value of the flight from those new dates. A value which was not even displayed to me during this process. Again, during flight change, Wizz Air computes the value of the new flight and only shows you if you have to pay more for the new dates. It purposely does not warn you that not only you don't have to pay more, but that you are exchanging tickets worth 260 Eur to tickets worth 40 Eur and that this will affect your refund value too. Besides this practice being so obviously mean to trick you, is this even legal? To make a parallel, it is not legal to run an online shop that shows products you can buy, to charge your customers and to not show them the price they will be charged with. Even if you add this to your Terms & Conditions, that the client must do whatever they can to figure out the price and that you're free to charge whatever you like, it is not legal to do so.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Malaga to Bucharest,May 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,True,Malaga,Bucharest,,Positive,0.9735

My friend and I have had problem after problem since we booked flights with them back in Sep 2022. They cancelled our outbound flight to Reykjavik without explanation, and there was no alternative with Wizz Air for the same day we wanted so we cancelled that flight with them and ended up paying more for another airline to fly on same date! They still haven't acknowledged or responded to our requests, let alone refunded the flight fare yet! It’s been 3 months. On a separate return flight with Wizz Air (that shockingly wasn’t cancelled), online check-in did not work - with a message of internal error appearing on the online portal. 3 times I tried to check in online with the same issue recurring, so I had no choice but to leave it there. At the airport, the desk staff made us pay airport check-in fees of 45Euros per person, which is outrageous in itself, despite us explaining the online error we faced, and then said you can contact Wizz Air customer service later to claim this back/ask them to waive fee. Absolutely ridiculous. There is not a Wizz Air representative present at the airport, as all their desk staff is outsourced so trying to have any matters sorted on the day is futile as these staff members have no authority to make decisions. To make matters worse, one of the in-flight crew members were also extremely rude. I was travelling with a friend who became injured during our trip and needed accessibility assistance; the crew member failed to communicate how she would be supported upon landing to get off the aircraft, and became very rude and impatient in her responses, when we asked legitimate questions after landing. We waited until all passengers had left the aircraft, and only then approached them to find out what was going on but we were just sharply told to “Wait!” without any clarification about what help will be offered. It is disgusting that they would treat a vulnerable customer with so much disrespect, and do so little to reassure them. We have been contacting them for months since our initial booking, but have not had any response or any positive action taken to resolve matters via email and through their contact form online. It is almost impossible to get hold of them. They simply don't care, and just want people's money. It seems it is not only their customers they treat so poorly since I spoke to a crew member on the flight, who also moaned that they have received many complaints and even as a staff member, she wasn’t even offered a flight with them to visit her family members who were unwell or easily given time off. It’s clear they are stone cold as a company, and care about nothing but profits. There are so many negative and worrying articles about them in the media. Still, they don’t act on customer complaints in a timely manner. I rarely waste my time and energy on writing bad reviews, but Wizz Air have been so poor with their customer service and strike me as a very unethical company given the countless bad reviews and comments I see online everywhere, that I feel compelled to write my experience also. I would not even give them a single Star but unfortunately you have to click on one to post a review!! I am fuming and will never be using this airline again.

They first ask for a screenshot of the technical mistake, you show it to them and then they say: ""You should have called our Call centre - it\s your fault.""

So, I arrived at the airport (with two small children!), only to be told that I have to pay 120 euro to be checked in at the airport, otherwise I will not be able allowed in the plane to return to our home in the UK.  I called the customer care line, who reassured me that I should pay the exorbitant fee, keep the receipt and just request a refund once back in the UK. Which I did and the reply was that ""I should have read your terms and conditions and have completed the online check in, as per your terms and conditions"". I have since read many cases where people have been conned in paying the airport check in fee after they could not check in online, due to a fault in the online check in system!

I start feeling that they fly between the serious companies, which really respect their customers and do everything for their flights to be on time. Last experience was the last one for me choosing this unprofessional company, which have interest only for taking your money, after that you don’t matter for them. Because a redirected flight, I lost my connection to my final destination, I lost my rental car, and my hotel and I had to book a hotel in the new destination and a new flight for the next day for my final destination and another rental car. Besides that they kept us waiting in the new destination airport (which was not the plan)like sheep, while everyone asked questions about what’s happening. No one knew anything, so I get frustrated. All this coming after another flight with Wizz Air where my flight was delayed 3 hours just the day before. And the last one was when I come back after the long story.

249,A Marsha,Norway,2022-08-27,1,"My journey as a family of 2 adults and 2 children was to travel from Bergen to Tenerife through Wizzair and LOT airlines in this sequence. As I didn’t find any available direct flights to Tenerife by the time of booking the tickets in April 2022. First, I booked a flight for 4 passengers from Bergen to Gdansk  with WizzAi, which is canceled by Wizzair after the planned departure time). I have booked one night in a hotel in Gdansk on 25/06/2022. Bought 4 tickets for the whole family with LOT Airlines from Gdansk to Warsaw in order to take another aircraft to Tenerife. Booked another 4 tickets from Warsaw to Tenerife through Wizz Air at the end. On the planned day we went to Bergen Airport. The departure time was at 14.05. We received a sms from Wizz Air  the flight is delayed and the estimated departure will be: 14.40, then another sms at 14.27 that the flight was delayed again and the new departure will be at 16.00, then another sms about a new delay to 16.30. At 14.47 they sent sms that the flight was canceled without mentioning the reason for cancellation. No one from WizzAir was in the airport to inform us what to do and no one called us. We went home with our kids again and tried to contact Wizz Air. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone with a paid phone call, they said that there are no other available flights, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried on my own to find another solution, and I found a flight at 22.40 to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car and drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife on the second day. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured me that everything is OK. I got the same confirmation number, I rented a car and paid online from Katowice Airport to drive with my family over the night to Warsaw as we did not find a hotel to accommodate us. We went to Bergen Airport again with our kids. The new boarding was at 22.40 on Saturday 25/06/2022, but they told us that the flight was delayed and then was also canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport, the same as for the first time. Just those from Bergen airport gave us a paper stating our rights and they said that Wizzair will contact us, but no one has contacted us. I called WizzAir again. They couldn't find any other alternative flights, and asked me to send them a claim to get a refund and any other expense that I lost due to the two cancellations. I received a SMS at 06.00 am that the flight was canceled. (7 hours after the scheduled departure time). As a result of that , we could not travel to Poland and we missed the hotel accommodation, the flight from Gdansk to Warsaw, the car rental fee in Katowice and on top of that we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I searched again and again and I found another route with another airline and of course the price was doubled. The original price was around 9000 Norwegian krone. The only available tickets that I found cost over 20000 NOK. I had to book it.

Attempted their call centre to wait on hold for 35 minutes to get an answer of “ye” .. calmly opened open the conversation with “our flight was cancelled“ to a reply of “oh well call other number” and hung up. You’ve successfully ruined a trip - cost us hotels - non refundable and hours of chasing for options which would result in 1000 euro plus in costs - which at last minute prices are not worth it Is it worth the stress and upset to chase and get a reply of decency?

We chose to fly with Wizz Air primarily because of the flight times that suited our schedule. Checking in was fine, there were hidden costs that can be expected from budget airlines. I downloaded the App which was not helpful as I had to constantly find the email with my code to access any part of the app. Finding the email was also a challenge as Wizz Air had sent me tons of promotional junk emails. Anyway, all that aside, we were on our merry way. On both flights the luggage check in queue was enormous. We arrived 3 hours before our flight which was not international and were almost late because of the queue. We only queued to tag our pram as we were travelling light, but there was no one to ask and it was not clear on the site. Both flights there was only one staff member for premium and one staff member for economy so either way the queue was ridiculous. Fine, we thought we had the time as Wizz Air (on both trips) had texted to say the flight was delayed. However none of the airport gate signs indicated the flight was delayed so after rushing through, skipping any sort of food with a baby we made it to the gate to leave. The airport sign actually said 'gate closing' but when we arrived there was just a lot of people sitting on the floor wondering what was going on. Eventually after about an hour an announcement that the cabin crew were in the airport was made, but no indication of how long was given. On our outbound flight we waited for an hour and half and ransacked the vending machine to feed our family and on the return flight we must have waited over 2 hours, again in a waiting area with very little seating, I had to stand for almost 2 hours with a 2 year old whilst being almost 7 months pregnant.

She is 10 years old I tried to book for her in the website but I couldn't because there is no option to make a reservation for a child in their website so I booked for her as an adult ticket. Things went smoothly in Dubai airport in Wizz check-in counter. But in the way back in Budapest airport, there is one lady in the check-in counter wanted thing to be difficult for us. She said that your daughter ticket was booked as an adult ticket and I can't see her name in the system and you need to book another ticket for her and the Hungarian custom are very strict about this. I told her there was no issues in Dubai airport and they said it's ok they just adjust her date of birth with nothing more. Then she asked about her vaccination report I told her I'm going home and they don't request vaccination report or even PCR test. She was looking for anything just to make it more difficult for us. After that she told me to wait few minutes for the Hungarian airline reply. Few minutes she left her desk so I went to other guy working in special assistance desk I gave him the passport and the booking number. He wrote the details of ticket and he pointed to the service desk behind me and told me to go there. I went there within One minute the lady gave me back my documents.

On the return journey no reason was given for the four hour delay. It can only have been a Wizz Air issue as a RyanAir Flight at 9.20 p.m. took off on the same route only 6 minutes late. On the outward journey the cabin crew were surly, rude and offensive. They refused to answer questions from multiple customers about the delay.

Customers were not rude - they were only asking genuine questions. The service was the worst I have ever seen - not just when flying. Customers deserve better.

We had just flown into Milan from New York and we were connecting to Cagliari, Sardinia in April 2022. We were sure to have our bags the allotted and accepted sizes. When we went to the Check-in Desk, the woman at the check-in in Milan said that we needed to purchase our boarding passes. She further stated that two of our bags were not compliant when indeed there were others identical that went through without being charged an extra hundred dollars. The folks traveling with us are 80 years old, one with a cane, and this woman showed no compassion. Because my phone was in airplane mode on the flight right before this, I was unable to check in within 3 hours prior to this flight. I had my tickets and barcode on my phone. She gave us two little pieces of paper and we had to go to this kiosk and wait 15 minutes in line to purchase two more boarding passes. We had purchased these tickets through e-Dreams where each time I purchased a ticket, the price went up. I paid an extra $125 for two more boarding passes. I was about to pay for my personal ticket but then I thought, I am going to go straight to the line and not go through that woman because I have my ticket. That worked for me, but the elderly couple were extremely distraught and upset over this experience. I ended up ordering two new tickets for them for the return trip. I double-ordered because I did not want to get saddled with another boarding pass fee. I did not use e-Dreams either this time and that helped. I contacted Customer Support a I do not like to write negative reviews, but they kept giving me the run-around.

They need to rebook us onto the next available flight and they were completely useless. Lots of people lost their holidays just like that. It's funny how easy they will take money off of us for luggages being cm than the allowed dimensions but will not even speak to us when the cancel entire trips. I have never felt so neglected before! The customer service on the phone was also not helpful at all telling us we need to do this online.

Before you arrive to the airport, you’ll have an email saying that the plane is delayed for around 1 hour. By the time you walk inside the airport lounge, there will be another delay for 35 minutes. When you are queuing for the gate and passport clearance, another 30 minutes. Then, just when you think you’ve finally made it inside the plane and ready to take off, they slap you with an additional 45 minutes delay. You get an almost 3 hours delay in what is supposed to be a 3.5 hours flight. You’d think by then at least they’ll give you free peanuts for compensation.  If they could legally monetise your complaints and suffering, I bet they would. Yet I still consider myself getting a comparatively better flight experience, compared to what other reviewers are saying here. If you’re using online check-in, make sure you pay for the £2 option for “online check in”, even if they stated that online check in will be available “for free” 48 hours before flight. If you don’t pay, the website/app will display an error on the last step of your check in. Changing browser, clearing cache, or calling the customer service won’t help you.

We then boarded to be held on the ground for 2 hours while they attempted to resolve what transpired to me a wildcat strike by ground staff.

That is, after I paid already for priority boarding at 42 euros, on top of my ticket price. Then upon emailing their customer service about the situation, with photos of receipts and boarding pass, they denied me a reimbursement, citing it was my responsibility to do the check-in before, whereas it was theirs to provide me access to the check-in. Also, their aircrafts are very uncomfortable, noisy, and they feel unsafe. And their flight attendants tend to be a little rough and prosaic.

371,William Critchlow,United Kingdom,2021-11-25,3,"Wizz Air is a cheap airline and like all cheap airlines they seem to pile on the money by charging for your seat after you have purchased a ticket. So the fee you see is just to get you through the door - any bag larger than a shoe box you pay for - check in at the airport £35 per person. Seats - The price you see is for a ticket. I am yet to find a way to book without being charged £20 on top for a seat. Regardless of whether I choose the seats or allow them to. If there is a way, it’s hidden or not obvious. Inflight - Usual small selection of expensive snacks - anything goes wrong expect to be quoted terms and conditions stating they can’t help and you should have known this. Refunds - if you actually manage to get one it is to a Wizz Air account to use with Wizz Air. So not actually a refund at all. It cost me €70+ euros for checking in 2 people at the airport which I was forced to do as their app is unreliable. It always seems to crash when trying to use it to check in so you need to check in from a computer. I was one of many dozen at the airport on both recent occasions when I travelled with the same issue and same huge additional bill to pay before we could travel. They don’t care, they say pay or don’t travel and lose all the money as our refund policy prevents you refunding under such circumstances unless you bay x 10 for a flexible refundable ticket.

374,S Weare,Canada,2021-10-29,2,"There is a new model of airline that desperately wants to undercut the prices of other airlines to get your business, and that is Wizz Air. They present a low priced ticket to snipe your attention and your money, then once you’ve committed your purchase, they add on all of the extras. Do you  want to sit with your young child? They’ll charge you for that. Do you want to carry a bag with you larger than a computer case? They’ll charge you for that. Did you want to check in for your flight somehow? They’ll charge you for that (they even charge for online check in). You get a cheap price up front until they secure your business, but once they have it, the stack on the extra fees until your ticket price becomes comparable to an actual reputable airline. You will not be able to fly without paying extra fees. Because I didn’t check in online the day before (because you know, I have things to do before I go on vacation) they charged me an extra $150 dollars just to do a regular check in. Then, because I had a cabin-sized bag and a camera bag, they charged me an extra $25 for that. Then because I didn’t pay for assigned seats they actually sat my four year old child away from us. They had it on record that he was four years old and their seating arrangement came up with that! Can you believe it? Sure we could switch it around so he wasn’t unaccompanied, but they were perfectly fine with separating the child from his family because a fee wasn’t paid. That’s a pretty gross business practice and I almost wonder if it was intentional because a fee wasn’t paid. For real. This becomes a moral and ethical issue when they will make a child sit alone unless you pay an extra fee for seating. It’s actually a disgusting business model and I will never fly this deceptive airline again. Just pay the extra money for a more reputable airline instead of this sneaky nonsense that Wizz Air pulls on its clients. So what is Wizz Air prioritizing? Cheap shot fees over customer service and satisfaction. DO NOT book this airline because it looks like a deal. It is not a good deal. They will loot you in one way or another by the time you get on that plane, and if you don’t pay the extra fees, they’ll show you why you better pay them in advance next time. Go with a more reputable airline that doesn’t hide fees and carry on such underhanded business. Somewhere a board of directors is congratulating itself for this business model.

382,Jean Kallenburg,Czech Republic,2021-09-26,1,"I had an extremely negative experience with Wizz Air yesterday while attempting to fly to Reykjavik. First, I received my boarding pass on my phone prior to arrival at the airport and didn't need to check any baggage, so I went straight through security and into the airport. Budapest airport doesn't announce the gate for your flight until about 30 minutes prior to check-in closing, so I waited around for a while. Finally, my gate information appears and I went straight to my gate to check in (almost the first one in line). Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. ""Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers – regardless of origin – are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection."" - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return. No matter the suggestion I made, the Wizz Air authorities were disrespectful and adamant that I do not board the plane. And I believe its also relevant to add that I'm a 19 year old solo female traveler, for which the thought of missing my flight and being stranded in a foreign country is not particularly pleasant, however I was met with no sympathy from anyone during this experience.

Many of the passengers on the flight were either not wearing masks at all, or wearing them in such a way that it was neither covering their mouth nor their nose. I initially kindly asked some of the infringing passengers to properly wear the mask, to which they first ignored me and then they started making insulting comments towards me in Romanian (I speak the language so I understood what they said). When I raised this issue with members of the crew, they shrugged me off and told me that there is nothing they can do about it and that I should sort this issue. I do not believe that it is the job of passengers to enforce basic covid safety rules, and I also believe that the airline has a duty of care towards all its passengers. The incident made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe during the entire duration of the flight. Moreover, I noticed that during the entire duration of the flight, no member of the flight crew took any measure or said anything towards other rule infringing passengers, not even when passengers without masks were passing by them on the corridor. I find this to be unacceptable, for a member of the flight crew to pass multiple infringing passengers on the corridor and not do even as much as ask them to follow international guidelines and regulations regarding safety during the Covid Pandemic.

Now it feels that they are solving their cash flow problems by allowing new booking only to cancel them later, often “at the last minute” (a few hours before the flight). My flights to Moscow in June 2021 were cancelled twice, second time I was already in a hotel near the airport as the flight was very early morning, so had to come in the ending. So I lost money on transport, COVID test and hotel. My friends flight to St Petersburg was also cancelled, she opted for a refund which is promised in 30 days… Good luck with that. When they cancel the flight, they offer refund or re-book, but refund only for “new” money, not if your used credit accumulated with them during pandemic for the past cancelled flights… so I had to re-book. And since then my booking was cancelled or amended three more times within 2 days. Dates get pushed further and further away from originally booked flights, like a month and a half later. I checked availability on site prior rebooking and noticed that tickets price is 3-4 times higher than mine… so my guess is that my booking is being bumped off as they sell tickets for much higher price! Or may be they don’t intend to fly at all, just collect new payments anyway to save themselves…. In addition some add-on services are NOT refundable as it turned out, specifically “provided by partners”. Once after cancellation and request to add credit to the account I discovered that around £18 “disappeared” without explanation. I’m not sure what “service” was deducted.

444,Benoit Hanssen,Italy,2020-10-19,1,"While the service overall is similar to other low cost airlines (for example no leg space, charging extra for everything, etc.), Wizz Air is running a check-in racket: 1) As with other airlines you can check-in online, but unlike other airlines you have to pay to do that. No, it is not just for your preferred seats, but irrespective of which seats you select and occasionally you can't even do that. Note that the Wizz Air online check-in closes 3 hours before departure! 2) To not pay for the check-in, according to the Wizz Air website, is possible at the airport by using the self-service check-in, and if those are not available at the traditional check-in desk. 3) However, this is not the case. At Milan Malpensa Terminal 1 on Friday, and at Vienna Terminal 3 on Sunday (today), there was no self-service check-in available (I confirmed this with the available check-in staff), and the traditional check-in counter would only check us in if we paid €15/person. 4) This is not all, at MXP the payment is handled by another desk which charges a €5/person commission and at VIE the commission is €5/transaction. So when you book with Wizz Air you need on paying at least €7-8 for the check-in online, or €15 if you do so at the airport plus €5 commission. This is not an optional extra service! By the way, the check-in staff cannot help you because they ""do not work for Wizz Air"" (they told me this in both MXP as well as VIE).

I paid for 10KG luggage I didn’t actually need. I thought I was signing up for priority but to be honest I did the booking quickly and didn’t read everything. Trick is to read very carefully regarding the numerous add on options. I only had a really small bag so didn’t need that add on at all. What I should have done was chose my seating at the time of booking. I waited till after and it ended up costing me more. No doubt about it, their software will stick you in a middle seat, probably far away form anyone else in the booking. Trick is to select your seat at the time of Booking. I am 6 ft so needed an aisle seat. I got this. The flight was manageable for me, even though my other leg was pressing against the seat but it wasn’t uncomfortable.

So accepting this again finally meant that my entire trip was cut down from 10 to 8 days. The next point on the downside was that after these changes I got the information that my flights were unable for online check-in. However my partner could check-in online without problems although I was the one with the so called ""priority"" status. Because of that I ended up with center seats on both sectors. I have to mention that check-in on both airports was smooth and done within 2 minutes. I also have to say that for short flights the Wizz Airseat configuration is acceptable but definitely not what you would get on premium airlines (230 instead of 200 allows an idea how tight everything is). The crew was nice and seemed to be motivated and drinks from the onboard bistro service were sold at reasonable prices. Both flights landed ahead of time and WIZZ managed the new COVID procedures very well and distributed the necessery health declarations during boarding. Would I recommend WIZZ for short flights?

461,G KIaridos,Greece,2020-07-10,1,"I bought the expensive (FLEX or something) ticket for 1 July from Luton to Thessaloniki for 26th July. The Greek Government  said that direct flights from the UK to Greece would continue to not be permitted from 1 July (they were not permitted during June, and they were thinking of allowing them from 1st July onwards, but changed their minds, and first announced that on 26th June). He also said that the official announcement was going to come out on 29th June. I didn't want to wait till 1 day before my flight for WizzAir to cancel it (and I found out from others that they ended up cancelling it on the 30th and a mere 14 hours before the actual flight), thus I tried to book another flight. In that effort, I ended up cancelling my ticket which led to the first ridiculous policy they have - it takes 72 hours for them to put the ""refunded"" money into a ""Wizz Air account"", why 72 hours? The second ridiculous policy is that after they added it I would only have 3 months to book another flight with them, otherwise they keep the money, which is ridiculously short even for pre-COVID times, it should be 12 months at least, and probably 24 or 36 now that COVID is around. I would have found that reasonable. But regardless, I couldn't wait 72 hours to book another flight with them, so I ended up booking with another company for my actual flight. Once the 72 hours passed, my money was added to the ""Wizz Air Account"", after which I proceeded to try to get a refund to one of my actual bank accounts. In that process, they ask for the reason for the refund, and they have two new options ""Cancellation initiated by Wizz Air due to COVID"" and ""Cancellation initiated by customer due to COVID"" - I picked the second option, assuming that there is a difference from a similar cancellation pre-COVID times, and thus that I would actually get a refund (otherwise what's the point of having such an option). Apparently, cancelling my flight due to COVID (a flight which was gonna get cancelled for sure by them eventually) and having bought the more expensive ticket wasn't enough to get a refund.

You`re fault pay 45 euros or lose the flight!! Wizz Air have definitely changed their customer care from good to tell everyone to go away! We understand it is difficult for airlines at this moment but brutal and rude response to genuine enquiries is not the way to treat long standing honest and decent clients.

467,Demetris Georgio,United Kingdom,2020-06-18,1,Customer service is absolute shambles! I contacted Wizz Air on 15/06/20 at regarding my booking to enquire what my cash refund would be if I were to cancel my flights. The agent I was speaking to confirmed that an amount of £1221.00 would be refunded back to my credit card. The difference between what I actually paid £1609 is what they are charging as a cancelation charge. The agent further clarified that the amount of £1221.00  would be credited to my credit card account within 2/3 weeks. Upon being given this information and only because this information was given to me I agreed to cancel my booking.  Shortly after cancelling the aforementioned booking I made an entirely new booking for the same flight & date for only £670.00.   I called Wizz Air again just to re-confirm that I should expect the refund to my credit card no later that within 2/3 weeks only to be told that the agent I spoke to on 15/06/20 with whom based on the information they had given me & proceeded to cancel my original flights with had in fact given me incorrect information & that I would not be receiving a refund to my credit card but instead the amount of £1221 would be credited to a Wizz Account and that I would need to use this credit within 3 months!!  This agent proceeded to advise me that Wizz Air cannot be held responsible for a colleagues error which is an absolute ridiculous & totally unacceptable statement to be made. Without the refund as promised by Wizz Air our holiday is now in jeopardy in addition we stand to lose our deposit for the accommodation which was booked independently from Wizz Air as we now have only until 18/06/20 to confirm that we still want the accommodation. WizzAir have breached the agreement made with me & in addition are legally responsible for the actions of its employees. my complaint was closed as I did not respond the confirmation email “thank you for submitting your enquiry. We will look into this and contact you ASAP. “ A representative advised this is because I did not respond saying thank you! ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Larnaca,June 2020,,,,,,,1,no,False,London,Larnaca,,Positive,0.9071

So I started booking again the next available flight. And if on my original booking I had a package with priority boarding and large trolley on board, they only gave me back the priority boarding (useless by the way) so I had to pay another £30 on top of my original booking for nothing. The only way to contact them is through a call centre which charges a fortune (so stay away from it). This company used to be a lot better some years ago but it got worse and worse, year after year. I remember when I used to get £60 flights with return from UK to Romania and with £25 extra for a membership you would get benefits like priority boarding, free seat selection and extra large trolley.

476,L Bale,United Kingdom,2020-05-02,1,"I bought return tickets for my entire family (5 persons, one of which 3 years old) for the above mentioned flights in October 2019. The flight was scheduled for 19 May 2020. Given the worldwide pandemic crisis, lockdown restrictions were set in place by the government of Romania and UK. As such, I called WizzAir customer service at the beginning of April 2020 to enquire about the flight status. I was advised that the flight was still going ahead as planned and that passengers will be informed about cancellations due to Covid19 via email (when applicable). When I asked about the notice period I was informed there is not a set notice period and it could vary from 2 weeks to next-day cancellation notice. WizzAir personnel advised me not to cancel my booking as yet and wait for further communication closer to the flight date, and that if I still wanted to cancel the flights due to the Covid19 pandemic and further restrictions inposed by government then I should do so 14 days prior to flight date to ensure I am not charged additional cancellation fees. I called customer service again on the 1st of May 2020 and I was advised the flight is still going ahead as scheduled and if I wanted to cancel the flights WizzAir will charge 60 Euros/person/flight. This is unacceptable considering the current worldwide situation, and more specifically the restrictions imposed by the government. The UK is under lockdown with no end date in sight (at the point of this complaint), which means all non-essential travel is not permitted. Additionally, social distancing restrictions are further imposed by the Romanian Government and the UK government, including 2 meters distance between people. These measures were not respected. As such, the flight should have been cancelled, in line with government guidelines. It is not acceptable for a company not to adhere to Government guidelines and put customers at risk. I find it appalling that flights are not cancelled in advance by WizzAir (given specific lockdown instructions set by the government) and that passengers are required to cancel the flights more than 14 days prior to the flight so that the cancellation fees are not increased. It is absurd to charge the cancellation fee per person per flight and not per booking, meaning that the customer receives a 10th of the price paid. Based on the information I received from the WizzAir staff, the flight cancellation period varies from 2 weeks to 1 day. This means WizzAir deliberately does not adhere to WHO and Government (country specific) guidelines and restrictions, so that they can retain most of the price paid by customers when booking flights. Aside from this blatant disregard for pandemic restrictions, the customer service personnel was rude and dismissive over the phone, with no willingness to discuss the options available for customers. When I was given the information relating to the cost of cancellation, the call handler was abrupt and repeatedly asked me ""Should I cancel this or not?"" without allowing me the time to process the information received and to calculate/ understand how much will all this cost.",,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,February 2020,,,,,,,1,no,True,,,,Negative,-0.9821

I use wizzair every year to go to Sofia to see my family and every time I get fucked up. If it is too big a bag, a problem of online check-in I find myself paying up to 70€ more. Sometimes to pass online check-in you have to select seats on the plane, but you have to pay 35 € / person. This time, because the plane was advanced one day, there were problems with online check-in. My husband and I decided to go to the airport earlier to avoid paying the fees. But there again we had to pay € 70 to print our tickets! A shame ""We understand but there is nothing we can do the service is blocked"". In addition to uncomfortable planes, barbaric schedules, absent customer service, there are delays and cancellations every time. And in the end we pay as much as a normal first class plane.

If you are a traveller or enjoy visiting new cities please take 2 mins to read this: I had a flight from Berlin to Budapest on 6.12.2019, it was overbooked so I was denied boarding. I contacted the airlines in the next day and until today I didn’t receive the compensation as per the EU regulations. I was accused of not showing up at the counter to take the denied boarding form. This is not true because I showed up in the counter and was given back the check-in money in cash. In addition, I was granted a one night stay at the airport’s hotel and the officers clarified to me to claim the compensation online. So how can I not show up in the counter and take these? I understand that an overbooked flight can just happen but what is not accepted is to spend 40+ days sending several emails to get the compensation.

When we explained that we didn't and attempted to show both old tickets as well as information on commonwealth territories, they ignored us and rudely spoke over us. Then when they finally acknowledged us they spoke in a very unpleasant tone to tell us to basically be quiet while they get information (information that we already had).

499,M Kielen,United Kingdom,2020-02-24,2,"Wizz Air never seems to stop surprising with its tendency of maximising their profit and reducing their service quality at the same time. This time we flew from Luton to Sofia  and back. And despite doing everything in the same way as before each time I failed to have all my family sitting together when opting for the automatically allocated seats. And I’m not talking about being split by isle or next row but 5-6 rows apart. So now the only way to have all of us sit together is by paying a premium of 17 Euros per person each way which adds nearly 140€ to our already high fares (half term craze)! I could be listing all minor issues with Wizzair for hours but another major one is the ridiculously low luggage allowance they call “free on-board baggage” which really only allows you to have a small backpack or ladies purse. The only way around it is guess what (?) paying around £50 extra to have a 20kg checked-in bag or purchase priority service which then gives you the same allowance you’d get with every other airline in the world. Finally just to show how bad their service is, when we were being transferred back to Sofia airport and been asked which terminal we’d be flying from, there was no way of getting this information from neither the Wizzair emails, their ticket or even their website. Instead we had to google it and verify from a 3rd party website which is just a joke!

When booking I bought the extra size. I was then annoyed to see at the check in those who had larger than the allowed size were being let through without having to pay more, some had two or three bags. The staff were mentioning it was too big to some but letting them through anyway, some they were charging. If the policy is to allow bigger bags fair enough but what is really unfair is my bag was only slightly bigger than the allowed size, so why did others not have to pay for bigger and I did? (I took pictures to prove it). I complained about this via the form on the website and the response had nothing to do with the complaint. I replied saying this and they said it was too late now. Their number is really hard to find but I called and was told I would be transferred, I was put on hold for 20 minutes and then they cut me off. I called back, no apology, I was told someone would call me back that day, a week later nothing. I left messages on twitter, they ignored them – although they “liked” a reply to one of my messages which suggested I called them again, so they were aware but not bothered to try and resolve it. I kept on leaving messages on twitter, eventually they told me to call the number I originally, although that was a battle to get it from them. I called and was told no one on that number could help and as for the lack of service he wouldn’t apologise “as it was nothing to do with him”. He didn’t listen to what I was saying but eventually said he would escalate it and I would get an email – which is rubbish by this point. Over a week later nothing. I am now far more angry about the way they deal with their customers, they seem to want to aggravate them, rather than resolve issues.

Had so many issues this year so far and it’s only February. I know all airlines reschedule flights but we’ve had six flights changed already and it was an absolute nightmare trying to rebook them. The app wouldn’t let us book and customer services were rude and unhelpful. Took us many attempts speaking to different customers services operators to get it done. We also had to change our parking at the airport which we’d booked with Wizz and ended up being out of pocket by £80 but as Wizz said to us that is not their problem. They just don’t care. After all that stress and having to change leave at work I have now just had another email from them telling me they’ve rescheduled the flights all over again and on top of that I’ve just spoken to customer services and they’re saying I haven’t paid for one of my flights which is untrue.

We explained we had already flown here by the same airline with the same bags and they forced us to pay 50 euros upfront.

Announcements from the flight deck were audible and informative. Wizz Air sent useful SMS the day prior to the flight home advising of possible air-traffic delays (which did not materialise).

Wizz air changed flight times by 3 hours and sent us an email with the details of the change. We got an email to confirm the change we did. When it was time to check in we followed their instructions and downloaded the app and put our details in (we almost always check in for all our flight) and tried to check in. It wouldn't allow us and told us to go to their website. We then went to the website and tried to check in and we had issues again. Got a message saying that there was a disruption to the flight. So we printed out all our documents and went to the airport and told them we had issues checking in online using their app and website they told us we had to pay 35 euros to check in at the airport. We told them there was an issue with their system and it wasn't our fault. They forced us to pay the additional 70 euros. Ended up being the most expensive flight for us. There was another 30 odd people who found themselves in this same situation on this flight and were requested to pay 35 euros.

Ok, we understood that and we waited in front of the desk.  After 30 minutes we received a temporary ticket without seat and they told us to wait until all passengers are boarded and see if we have any seat available, of course having a wizz priority ticket..The second thing was that the flight had a delay but this is normal lately with wizz.

Although my girlfriend did not fly and was forced to exit the terminal. Wizz Air does not hold to its own rules, when asked they could not explain why my girlfriend wasn't able to fly although the baggage was in the limit. All that for petty 25 euros.

I had the Light “plan” selected with Wizz Priority added. I had no issues or whatsoever regarding my cabin luggage (did not have any checked-in baggage), the process at the gate went smoothly and very quickly (might be worth mentioning that on both outbound and return flights, the gate opened with a delay but regardless, everything went pretty fast afterwards). You only get priority when boarding the bus and at the gate, when they do the check-in, not when boarding the aeroplane like one may think. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful, the outbound flight was extremely smooth, no turbulences at all, the returning one had a few moments where it was slightly shaky. Yet, it was all good. The online check-in process was very easy. Be aware that if you do not check-in online, you pay a fee for the airport check-in. As for the luggage again, they even let this woman with a bag that clearly exceeded their dimensions limit in the cabin. Maybe she got lucky. Overall, I would fly Wizz again and I will in December, the same route. Absolutely love it. No “hidden” or “extra” fees as long as you read their rules carefully. For everybody else complaining, it is a low-cost company after all. Comparing it to other low-cost companies, I find Wizz the best when it comes to fares and services and everything else.

We arrived to check in to see a mass of people not in structured queues as there were more than double the amount of people for the standard queue barricades they had set up. It was a funnel effect of a large mass of people trying to jam in to one small entry line with no direction from surrounding staff who were simply standing there. Nobody was taking initiative. I asked a staff member where exactly we should be queuing for our flight and she directed us to 3 counters further down. We waited in the queue for half an hour. Then a different staff member asked if I was priority. I said no. She said I need to move to the next line. Turns out two lines are standard and one is priority however we weren’t told that and the priority line was written in small writing at the front counter at the bottom of the screen. After this staff member turned several people to the correct queue I suggested to her she could go through the very large line and check with people before they spend half hour in the line only to get to her and be told it’s the wrong line. She did this and subsequently 80% of the line had to move as they were also told the wrong thing. There were a lot of angry people. We then queued for another half hour in the right line only to get to the counter and the boy behind the counter to say he could not check me in. Because I hadn’t checked in online. When in actual fact my partner who booked my ticket with his on the same booking could not book me in online. He tried several times but the website seemed to not allow it. This was an IT issue not our fault however we were being penalised by being made to now pay for a ticket to be issued. We were sent to a different desk. The guy changed some things in the system. He said due to booking through an external booking provider it causes glitches in the system and I was not in my partners booking despite having a confirmation email and having paid for my ticket. He said next time to book direct. If external booking systems don’t work, then don’t allow people to buy a ticket through them?!we then had to go back to the same counter, explain to other customers why we were pushing in and then explain to the original boy that we were permitted to continue. Of which he questioned.we then only just make it to boarding and stand inline for 20 mins before another staff member who had been looking at everyone’s bags pulled me aside to say my carry on was too big. He waited til almost everyone had boarded before pulling a select few aside to charge for bags. Mine was literally 5cm over the bar: after 20 something flights this is the first time I have been stopped.my bag fit under the seat!!!

652,Paul Carey,United Kingdom,2019-07-03,1,"Luton to Lisbon. Over the last few weeks I have taken several flights between London and Lisbon on Wizz Air. Every flight I have taken has been delayed to some extent: the shortest delay I can recall was of 20 minutes; the longest was of about 2.5 hours. My flight on 2nd July was delayed by 1.5 hours. Wizz Air has used a variety of excuses when apologising in the aircraft for the delay in taking-off and arrival so it's not even worth repeating them. There is no point passengers and potential passengers trying to identify the reasons why this company seems incapable of taking-off and landing at the correct time, particularly on certain routes and particularly from Luton. The cabin crew on all my flights have been polite and professional but they too have seemed jaded and worn-down by the lack of on-time performance; after all, a flight that lands at 2.30am (instead of at the scheduled midnight) means a very late arrival home for the crew as well. The standard crew comment that ""this is aviation and you have to expect such things"" is now becoming the company's mantra. I don't care that Wizz Air charges for all types of luggage after the first small personal item; I don't care that I have to pay for seat selection as well as for food and drink; nor do I care much about the cleanliness of the exterior and interior of the aircraft. At the end of the day, I want what most people want: I want to arrive at my destination safely and at the time shown on the timetable.

Other horrible behaviour involves purposefully seating you apart when seats together are available in attempt to get you to pay for the privilege.

Wizz seats are not fine. In-flight catering options are slightly overpriced and not very appetizing. The rest was positive. Toilets are available and clean, no lines. Cabin was clean.

I replied back saying that I do not want copying and pasting paragraphs, I want a reply from the highest manager as her email was not addressing all my points and she showed no remorse. I received a second reply next day and again it was from her (they seem to not have a manager at all). At the end she wrote the following: "" I would like to inform you that Wizz Air has exhausted its internal complaint handling process"" which shows that I should not bother them anymore and as she mentioned in her previous email again ""no refund"".

While I have nothing special to say about the onboard staff (they were neither nice nor rude, almost non-existent, I would say), I was appalled about the attitude of the Wizzair staff at the airport. First of all, the boarding gate did not appear on the display for long time (even though we were very close to the departure time). When it finally did, the number was accompanied already by a flashing ""BOARDING"" sign which put pressure on us. The gate was A17 so we followed the signs and at one point the signs indicated a direction for gates A12 - A19. Here it's when I noticed, on the side, a Wizzair staff screaming something which I could not understand so I went to her asking what is that she was saying and she was extremely rude and basically shoved us (not indicated) to another Wizzair staff (would have not been easier to put a sign akin to ""A12 to A19 except Wizzair passengers"" rather than having that rude woman screaming?"". So we went to this other person, this time a man who was checking the boarding passes and the size of the backbags without ever lifting his head and with the utmost scary expression. He sent me on one queue while my friends to another. When I asked him why, even though we were on the same flight, he sent us on two different queues, his brusque reply was: ""There is a difference, just go"". Is this a normal reply to someone who is asking you something? To a customer? I fully understood that it deeply bothers them when someone ask them a question, silly or clever that it may be, they just don't want question.

I went straight to the Wizz Air customer services counter and explained what just happened, I showed the damage to the ground staff and they advised me that I should just email Wizz with photos. I specifically asked if I need proof from the airport for this complaint and she simply said no, which I did find odd but that has never happened to me before so I did not know the procedure. Naturally, when I emailed Wizz from home, they demand a number of paperwork including a Property Irregularity Report, which is obtained from the airport right there and then. Even though I have explained numerous times that I do not have the PIR form due to no neglect of mine, but because their staff failed to inform me correctly at their own counter, all I get is copy-paste robotic replies that they want the PIR form in order to process my complaint. When I called and I explained once more the issue, I was told that my case would be escalated to a senior department and I will hear back in 4-6 weeks. 3 months have passed with no reply, so I contact them again to check the process of my complaint. Guess what reply I get? A copy-paste robotic request of my PIR form. I am exasperated with their handling of my case both at the airport, online and over the phone, so far this has cost me £22 for checked-in baggage fees + £100 for a new suitcase as I was travelling again a week later + £20 on the phone bill for calling their expensive customer service line!",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to  Luton,November 2018,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,,1,no,True,Athens, Luton,,Negative,-0.9621

There were many airports on the way that we could have stopped at instead (Trondheim, Narvik, Alesund, Bergen, Oslo, the list goes on) so we knew there was something not right going on, and were given minimal updates throughout (for example, where Stavanger was). Two hours after landing there, we were told that we were being returned to Luton and there was no other option. There was no reason for this redirection all that way except that the airline knew they needed the plane in the morning for other flights, and lied to the passengers about the reason.

We never received an email for online check in or one that said we would have a 35 euro fee per ticket to print our tickets at the airport. After sorting that out and paying an extra 80 euros, my brother in law was told to take his bag on the plane. He explained multiple times that he had wine in his luggage and couldn't take it through security. They were adamant for him to take it, and of course security stopped him. Then we waited an absurd amount of time to board. The employees were stopping people with a purse and luggage carry on and making them go back to the check in gate and through security. You've got to be kidding! No wonder they were 30 mins late and took way too long to board! They also don't even offer water or pretzels/peanuts on the plane. All paid.

I checked all Wizz Air emails, in which I could not find any check in links, nor did I receive any reminder emails on the matter. I assumed that Wizz Air does not have online check in functionality or it was broken. When at the airport, I got asked to pay the sum of 33 GBP at the airport for failing to online check in. Given the airline's unwillingness to email people about checking in online and having a confusing and poor website UX that does not bring people instantly to the online check in page, reeks to me of a money grab. I reached out to the airline on the matter which not only did not apologize, but also failed to acknowledge any sort of problem and was unwilling to sort this out, which was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Luton to Lisbon,November 2018,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,3,no,True,Luton,Lisbon,,Negative,-0.9744

After booking and receiving the itinerary, we received many emails from them, ranging from flash sale offers to baggage allowance changes (this detail is important for later). We got to the check-in counter more than 2 hours before our flight but were told that we had to pay 35 Eur per person because we didn't do our check-in online. Our tickets were only 55 Eur per person, which means the check-in fee is more than half the price of the tickets. Right after being told that I had to do my check-in online or via the app at least 2 hours prior to the flight, I quickly downloaded the app and tried to do my check-in. All I got was an error message saying that due to baggage allowance changes, check-in via the app was no longer possible. While waiting in line to pay for the ridiculous fees, I went through every single email sent to me by Wizz Air; I read every word of the fine prints. There was not a single mention of the fee. When I got back to the hotel, I went through the emails 3 more times, still didn't find anything. I emailed Wizz Air (which btw was a long shot because their website says that they will take up to a month to respond any email and that phone calls to their centers would cost ridiculous amounts, even if you call from within the same country). They responded by saying that I should have read their T&Cs. Here's the thing, their T&Cs is 29 pages long with 16,000 words.

We waited, and when we checked in, we could not choose seats. The three of us were placed in seat a and c in one row and the last person somewhere else. When we boarded the plane, of course they have placed a person in the b seat. The same happened on the return flight, even if the plane was far from full. I do not like their way of getting more money out of every ticket. The flight is short 1.5 hours, so it is no problem to sit in a narrow seat with your knees in the seat in front of you. We left in the evening on a cold day in Norway, the plane was full, and every passenger had jacket and pullovers.

In principle, if a flight has been cancelled, the airline should provide the same flight to passenger at the soonest possibility. But  this is not the case with Wizz Air! My flight was cancelled and each passenger had to rebook him/herself the flight for another, already existing one, for which there are any free seats left. This means, some passengers may get to the desired destination in a couple of days, which is ridiculous! Also, for the time until the new flight, the passengers are not offered a full compensation for the accommodation expenses that occurred. In case WIZZ AIR is unable to perform the cancelled flight due to their lack of spare machines and makes people look for which flight there are any free seats left (limitation of their aircraft and service), they should take over all days the passengers are forced to book a hotel for!

When you book the ticket (and I have booked so many times flight tickets with different companies), there is not any message saying that the self check in online is mandatory. The way of wording for the online check in, is similar to the rest companies as usual saying that :the online check is available two or some days before the flight and if you like you can check in online by yourself to avoid the waiting time at the airport, but nowhere is clearly stating that you must check in by yourself. This is too obvious, that the company is just trying to find ways to earn additional money. It would be way better, to just increase your fares and include the implicit services within the fare. This is the most ridiculous charge I have ever paid to an air company. Other than that, we have been advised that our cabin luggage couldn't been carried onboard the plane to the normal cabin storage place, because we didn't book our ticket with priority boarding and there should be an extra charge if we wanted to take our luggage with us.

765,M Baker,United Kingdom,2018-11-01,2,"Today, I had THE worst experience of my life on Wizz Air. I arrived early for boarding so that I could find room for my backpack in the overhead compartment - which I did. I then took my row 'C' aisle seat. After boarding was completed, I was made to remove my backpack by the stewardess and force it under the seat in front of me. My backpack is large, flexible and within Wizz Air's size limits, but placing it there meant that there was no room left for my feet. (See photos). I could not place my feet outside in the corridor area, either as it would have tripped other passengers who were walking and blocked the food trolleys. I had no choice but to place my feet under the metal braces in the seat in front, meaning that every time the passenger in front moved in his seat, my foot would get crushed. By the end of the flight my foot was bruised, and I was in pain, simply because my bag was too large to fit under the seat, and it should have been left in the over head compartment. Upon pointing this to the stewardess who instigated this episode without any consideration of the consequences, she told me to write to Wizz Air and complain, and that there was nothing she could do. It may be that Wizz Air will read this and decide to reply, stating that shortly larger bags, such as the one which I had to remove mine for will not be allowed without an extra fee. However, that is not the point. At the time of my journey, this was allowed, and. Wizz Air provided zero safe foot space. My bag was also too large to fit under the seat in front, and should have stayed in the overhead locker. Additionally, as my bag was too large to fit the seat in front, it was blocking the emergency escape route of the passengers sitting in the window and middle rows. This is dangerous, and I believe against passenger air transport safety rules. There were also a couple of other, issues regarding hygiene. I noticed that the toilets were cleaned by cabin crew, without wearing gloves, using paper towels from inside of the toilets. First the seat was wiped, then the sink and finally the same towel was dropped on the floor and the floor was wiped using the shoes. The stewardess then pick up the papers from the floor using her hands and flushed them down the toilet. After this, and without washing her hand, she walked to the food trolley and started serving food to passengers, touching coffee cups, water bottles, serviettes and sandwich wrappers. This has to be the worst case of hygiene which I have ever come across, and I would not trust any food served on this airline. I also noticed that the headrests on the seats had grease marks on them, as the paper headrests were missing. The Velcro exists to hang the headrests from, but in order to save costs, it seems like Wizz Air have decided not to care about this item either. I have travelled on Wizz Air on numerous occasions in the last 10 years or so (about 10 times this year alone), however the service has reduced dramatically, the prices have any rocketed (they are often more expensive than national carrier National carriers) and the staff's attitude to customers is simply atrocious - possibly due to their fast expansion.

The guy there mentioned that I was supposed to do the online checkin beforehand so I had to pay 194€ extra fee to the 4 of us.  Once we approached the boarding gate, one woman stopped me and asked me to put my hand luggage inside the measurement box. It turned out to be bigger and didn’t fit inside. She then asked me to pay a fee of 75€ extra. I also had a small backpack for my laptop and camera which she said was too much. I said that I would give it to my mom since there were 4 of us. She then stopped us all and forced us to squeeze all our stuffs (even food, clutches for money/passports/boarding passes) inside 4 hand luggage only (including the one I had already paid 75€ for). 3 out of these 4 luggage were to be put to the side of the cargo separate from us since the plane was full. I’m disgusted with how Wizzair treats their customers. In total, 269€ was thrown out of the window for us, buying us nothing but anger and disgust. Don’t waste your money and time.

I travel between university and home approximately every 2 months, and sometimes my family visit so you can imagine, there are a lot of bookings. No benefits whatsoever - no collecting airmiles, no benefits for frequent travellers. You have to buy a membership to get cheaper flights but nothing apart from that. The website is ridiculous. For example, last month (Sept 2018), I used my bank card for a booking and at the end of the transaction, I received an error notification that the bank card did not work and I was instructed to repeat my transaction again. A phone call came and I did not manage to try immediately. 2 minutes later, I receive an email with a summary of my booking because the transaction was actually complete! So luckily, I had not tried a second time. Another example (Sept 2018) is when I tried to add 2 suitcases to an inbound flight. But instead, they were added to the outbound flight! That is 2 suitcases of 20kg, so I am still waiting for my refund of almost £50. No emails from Wizz Air yet. I have travelled with Wizz Air for 5 years now, it used to be an affordable airline, simple way to get from A to B. Now each booking comes with a problem.

Then, also before boarding, they labeled the cabin luggage randomly and by force: I told them that I want to take with me in the cabin and that it was very small luggage, below the maximum limits for cabin luggage. They didn't care and lied that it will not necessary go to drop off, the flight attendant will hold them only if there will be no more space in the cabin. It was a lie because we were among the first to board and they took the luggage to the drop off. The places for luggage in the cabin were almost empty near our seats, so it was only mockery what they did. Besides that we had to wait at 3:30am half an hour for the luggage. Another problem is that the space in the seat is too small. I have 1.7 meters height and I stood with my knees stuck in the front seat. I cannot imagine how taller persons can fly 3 hours in that tiny place. Conclusion: never, ever flight with this joke of company, they have the absolute worst service I ever experienced.

So, now I had to get my check-in bag scanned as a hand luggage and all my perfumes, etc were thrown away by the airport authorities. When I reached the gate, the Wizz Air lady asked me to pay 65 euros to check-in my bag. I clearly said no and she and her colleague would not let me board the flight. According to them, if the flight had been delayed to 9pm, I should have been at the airport by 1pm to check-in the bag. The flight was further delayed to 5pm! I called the Wizz complaints department and asked them for assistance, to which he replied that I should just pay the money for the bag. After having argued with them for half an hour, I had no choice other than to pay! I ended up paying a total of more than 100 euros for a 12kg bag to get it from Bucharest to London.

I am writing this review to make others aware of the issues we and several of our wedding anniversary party, went through recently with Wizz Air. Altogether there were over 15 of us traveling with Wizz Air to 2 destinations from Sibiu; Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Luton Airport.  We arrived at the airport, most of us, 2 hours before we were to depart. For local airlines this is quite normal. What we did not expect is what happened to all of us and needs to be addressed immediately. We checked in only to be told that we had not ""checked in online"" 3 or more hours before, so each of us would have to pay an additional 35 EUROS to get a seat. All 15 of us were charged this. This needs to be advertised as a crucial piece of information and not in the small print. I believe this is part of a money-making scheme with the airline and should be addressed. They smiled at us a lot after they told us to go to the counter to pay the additional monies and then when we returned they sort of looked at the scrap of paper and smiled again and said priority queue.

815,Michael Herrera,United States,2018-07-24,1,"Budapest to Madrid. Wizz Air flight 2351 on Wednesday, July 18 left 6 hours 28 minutes late. During that time we were on the plane for four hours, during which time a passenger deplaned for ""family"" reasons, an extensive security check was done on belongings in the plane, more passengers wanted to deplane (apparently scared by the extensive security check) and then everyone had to deplane. We were hardly instructed on where to go on the way back to the terminal, ""go up the stairs"", and given no prior instructions on how re-boarding was to take place. In the commotion, five passengers, including me were left stranded in Budapest. For Wizz Air, we were automatically to be blamed, and had to pay for a new ticket if we wanted to reschedule. Perhaps the smart passengers stayed standing in front of the departure screens, but I was told that the plane was expected to take off at 11 PM. After missing dinner and not drinking for hours, I needed to sit down and try to cancel my Madrid hostel reservation online. Then much earlier than expected I heard an announcement. That was the only boarding announcement although two authorized agents stated that ""many"" were given. It didn't look like any information was given on the screens. The five that took a few minutes more to respond to the announcement could not pass a barrier that was no longer successful in reading boarding passes. There were no agents around that could help. Looking everywhere we asked an orange-clad worker to find someone who after his second call on his cell phone told us we were lucky, that we just had to wait right there at that spot because the airline had to change the crew. But, alas, nobody came for us. Then, to add insult to injury, we were told we had to pay again to reschedule. The other four did that. I refused and tried making all contacts possible to ask them to reconsider. After all, I would have expected that would be the correct thing to do. At this point I have plenty of reason to believe that I will not get my money back, like many before me.

Wizz Air did not have have enough staff at the check in counters. While 12 desks were ""open"" only 6 were manned....absolutely pathetic service. The end result was a rush to the departure gate, only to find that everyone was ""herded"" into a departure lounge that had seating for less than 10% of passengers. Priority boarding passengers were lined up outside the terminal and had to wait in the hot sun (it was an unusually warm English day) while the delayed incoming aircraft was refueled, resulting in several having to force their way back through the queue to get some shade.

830,W Jackson,United States,2018-07-05,1,"Vienna to Rome. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. Here are 3 reasons why: 1) They Charge you for everything. I mean everything. If you don’t have checkin completed before you get to the airport it costs $40 to get one there so you can fly (not an exaggeration). Printing the little piece of paper costs literally as much as the airplane ticket. In addition, there website is so sneaky and tricky that they won’t send an email asking you to confirm or anything. They will make it incredible you difficult to do so they can steal some more money. I had 5 different flights on this trip from several airlines and this was the only one I could not figure out how to check in and spend $40 on that. Also expect to get charged extra if you have any extra bags at all: purse, hand bag, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if you got charged for entering the plane with gum in your mouth. 2) Staff will treat you poorly. Aside from being charged for everything and nit pick on everything; there is no management in the building to talk to if you have an issue b/c the company is so small they have to hire an outside source at the airport. The staff treats you like criminals checking everything and looking for any little thing they can charge you with. From there you’ll be driven on a bus shuttle to the plane. Literally they are some stingy that you have to sit in the back of the bus if you are not priority. This doesn’t even matter, but it’s just that type of scroungy feel to the whole experience that makes it misserable. 3) They delayed the flight twice overall. I’ve flown about probably 10 or 15 times to places all over the world. I have had some great ones and some rough ones, but this is by far the worst.

With this in mind, I never thought I would have such a dreadful experience with an airline. On the first leg from Tirana to Luton, I tried to check in via the Wizz Air app, however it explicitly said that I could not check in online due to regulations from Tirana's airport. I went to the check in counter the day of the flight and I was harshly told by a Wizz Air employee to pay the charge or leave the airport, even though I was clearly explaining to them that checking in online was purely impossible- they refused to listen. The first absolute scam from this airline. The second leg was an even more dreadful experience. Before boarding a woman started interrogating all passengers like she was a prison warden about the number of carry on bags they had. I was fine, however there were people who were forced to pay cash on the counter, just for carrying a lap top in their hands. Second absolute scam. The flight was supposed to take off at 6 a.m UK time, but it took off at 7:30 a.m. The reason was ""a missing oxygen bottle"" which had to be delivered from Gatwick Airport. To add to the misery, we were left to wait not even inside the terminal, but in the stairs leading to the tarmac, for about an hour. The air was humid and I started having difficulty breathing. Many older people had to lie down on the ground, and many children started getting ill. It seemed like a scene from an apocalyptic movie - at 6 a.m on a Tuesday morning in London! The flight itself was alright. I want to point out that the captain of the flight, an Irish gentleman, fully deserved the title as he apologised profusely on behalf of a ridiculous airline.

We tweeted Wizz air asking for an update and they sent us a link to a website that said our planes original take off time? Helpful- I think not.

We landed just before 11.30pm and our check-in for our apartment stops at midnight. So we abandoned our original transfers to get a taxi so that we could arrive with 5 minutes to spare otherwise we'd have had to sleep on the street. We thought this might be a one off. But no.

We boarded the plane among the first 10 people and our suitcase was taken to hold. There were at least 30 suitcases (we counted, and we stopped counting after a while) which were taken on board after we boarded. So what is this s#1t? If only a certain number of suitcases are allowed on board, why don't they offer to allow people to check their hand luggage in advance?

855,Earl Husted,United States,2018-04-12,1,"Budapest to Bucharest. Our difficulties started long before we went to the airport. I noticed at home when I reviewed our ticketing information was that no seats were assigned. So I went online and discovered that to select seats you had to pay for any seat on the plane. Since it was only a bit over an hour flight we decided to let them randomly select our seats even if the three of us, including our 12 year old daughter, were not seated together. A few days before the flight I again went online and attempted to check in. The first section of check-in covered two items: the need to pay to have even one bag checked in (at the rate of $50 per bag) and their rule that there was no guarantee that you could even take one carry-on unless you were willing to pay $6 Euros per passenger for a pass - which supposedly also allowed you to board early. Since we had three bags to check-in and three bags to carry-on I paid over $170 online in order to avoid paying a higher price (as noted in the online check out info) at the airport. The next section of the online check in asked me to select our seats - again at a price. Already upset at the outrageous check-in bag cost I opted not to select a seat and the web site booted me out. I assumed I would just check-in at the airport counter and find out what seats were assigned to us by the airlines. Imagine our surprise when we were informed by the clerk at the counter that we had failed to complete the check-in process and therefore he could not issue tickets. He directed us to another Wizz Air counter down the hall where we were told that our failure to complete the online check-in process would cost us 40 Euro per passenger (120 Euros total) - we had no other option but to pay the 120 Euros. We then returned to the ticket counter and finished checking in. When we arrived at the gate we discovered that the $6 Euro pass we had purchased for each of us allowed us to board early - ya, right, on the bus which then took us to the plane. We stood in the bus for over 30 minutes waiting to be taken to the plane. Once the bus arrived it was a mad house getting off the bus and trying to board the plane. We noticed that most of the other passengers had brought not one but two carry-ons with them. We could have avoided paying the $50/bag cost of checking in our three bags. Nothing but scams on the Wizz Air website. When we arrived in Bucharest we discovered that our large checked-in bag had one of its four wheels removed.

While on holiday I got an automated text from Wizz Air saying my flight had been changed and I would have got an email with my new flight details. There was no email, and my account showed I was still on the same flight. Looking on Facebook, a lot of people had this issue and Wizz Air admitted (on Facebook, where not many people would check) that the text was sent in error. This is after lots of people (according to their comments on Facebook) spent lots of money calling their premium number to check what happened to their flight (many waiting upwards of half an hour and many not even getting through!). I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane. We waited, standing, on the bus for over half an hour before it took us to the plane. What's worse (not for me, but for the Priority passengers) is the other buses left before us so ours actually got to the plane second last! Priority were the first to the bus and amongst the last on the plane. Aside from being fast-tracked through security at Budapest (which had no queue anyway), I saw no evidence of Priority adding anything. Once on the plane, staff were nice and obliging, and the plane was clean. Food is expensive but you can bring your own from the airport. Tea is 2.5 Euros but you can ask for extra hot water for free. The pilot gave detailed information on the route and weather. The boarding process is very painful and I don't remember a single Wizz Air flight being on time (and I have flown with them several times).

I’ve sent messages to Customer Relations and many other Wizz Air Departments, asking for help but they ignored all communication. I have record of all these messages, all the complaints. Reading online this is a regular occurrence. We were not the only people at check-in desk having similar problems. We paid 70 Euros in order to board the plane. When we got home I contacted Wizz Air Customer Relations. Wizz Air’s Customer Relations Department has responded that they are going to refund only 50% of 70 Euros, meaning 35 Euros.

After canceling my flight, it's almost impossible to get a response from them in order to obtain the compensation I am entitled to. At the airport, the flight seemed to be delayed somewhat. At 9:45 am I got a message saying the flight had been canceled and I could rebook another one, with no further information. I tried to get information online but the WiFi had crashed under the increasing amount of people in the airport. After waiting in line at the information desk they told me they had no information at the time, but that the airport was closed and it wasn't due to the weather. When asking why the airport was closed, she simply replied: ""I can't tell you"", hinting that she knew, but I wasn't supposed to. After waiting around around for half an hour or so, they finally announced that we were allowed to leave the airport. I asked what that entailed exactly considering they were saying the flight hadn't been officially canceled, and they said I had to sign in order to receive further information. I asked to read the letter first, but they declined. I signed and received a letter in Hungarian which nobody was able to translate for me. Next they put me on a bus and dropped me off at the departure again. I was told to get in line where I'd paid the exorbitant airport check-in fee of 35 EUR earlier. It was a huge line which was hardly budging. Due to the enormous amount of people, I spent 2.5 hours waiting in line. When I got to the front, the lady told me she had no information. When I asked if there was anyone from Wizz airlines to talk to, she said she didn't know, and I had to queue up at the information desk which had a line of similar length. I expressed my doubts that they would be able to help me there and wanted to record her telling me that I had to go to the information desk so that they wouldn't send me right back. After standing in line for 30 minutes, I was told I had to go back to the place I just came from.

904,Sharon Ben Porath,Israel,2017-10-07,2,"✅ Verified Review   Tel Aviv to Bucharest. Not really low cost! Bad service turned it into a very expensive (and frustrating) experience for me and my family! I traveled with my wife and two children to Romania, and we were denied boarding at the gate of the flight back from Bucharest to Israel, because of overbooking. No matter how much we argued and insisted, we were refused. I must emphasized that at any stage there was no call for volunteers to give up boarding, as the EU regulation require in case of overbooked flights, before performing involuntary denial of boarding. The staff member at the gate told us that they are missing one seat, so 3 of us can travel. We explained that we cannot split. Only after we got back to the ticket office at the departure flights counters we were told that we are entitled only for a single denied boarding, as the 3 others had seats and chose not to fly. We had to buy new flight tickets for the next day in a different airline, as Wizz Air had no seats available in the following days. These one way tickets cost us more than the entire round trip with Wizz Air (although it was with another low cost airline). We had to pay for hotel another night, meals, transportation etc. I submitted a complaint and sent copies of all required documents and receipts. It took more than a month for Wizz Air customer service to respond, and their feedback is that they are willing to compensate me for denied boarding of only a single passenger. They provided very limited compensation for the other passengers. The overall compensation Wizz Air agreed for is €984, while my overall expenses caused by this denial of boarding was €2,426. Seriously, Wizz? We know that airlines overbook the flights, but compensate properly your customers when they are harmed by it! At least reimburse the actual extra expenses caused, I am not even talking about compensation for the frustration and trouble. Follow the regulations and ask for volunteers before you perform involuntary denial of boarding! Don’t split up families! If you deny boarding from a member of a family under a single reservation, compensate the entire family! None of us wanted to stay there. The youngest kid was crying, we all wanted to get home already, we had good reason that we explained that prevented us from splitting. Beware of Wizz Air.

When saving money isn't worth it, we all want a bargain but sometimes it's better to shell out a bit more than save money for an awful service. I booked a getaway on Groupon so if anyone reading this is in the same boat then I urge you to reconsider. Flying to Budapest the flight was delayed an hour and change with nothing resembling an explanation given, luckily the flight wasn't full so I could stretch out some but I could tell it would be uncomfortably cramped if anyone was sitting next to me, and I'm only 5'11 so I shudder to think how anyone over 6ft would fare. Then returning we find out much to out chagrin that we had to check in online, bear in mind no-one saw fit to inform us of this, not Groupon, the airline or the company we booked it through. And to make it worse me and my girlfriend were seated at opposite ends of the plane. The ground staff were of no help, not even attempting to help us find a solution let alone sympathise with our problems. So in summary, this airline may be cheap but if you have even a modicome of care for the pleasantness of your journey then I cannot recommend enough paying slightly more and flying with a reputable airline and I'm including easy jet and Ryanair so that should tell you something.

Since check in is done well in advance, and since I did not check in any luggage, I could pass the long lines and go directly to security. This was very convenient. If you don't want to pay extra you can only carry a small bag at this airline, but they make that very clear even in their advertisement, so it can hardly be a surprise for anyone. What is more annoying is that you cannot choose seats at check in without having to pay extra. Consequently I was placed in a middle seat, even though the aircraft was only half full. But the person next to me moved away quickly so I could move to the aisle seat. Seat comfort was not too bad, the seatbacks could not be reclined, but being tall I find it more annoying if people in front of me recline their seatbacks without looking back. The catering on board was very uniinteresting, and for someone who does not eat gluten there was hardly anything available. But I had brought my own food, so that was not a problem. All in all the flight was pleasant enough, and even though we were a bit delayed at departure we arrived in time.

At the Glasgow end, check in opened late, meaning a massive queue and minimum time to get through security and to the gate. Coming home from the Budapest end the organisation was non-existent. There were about 8 Wizz Air flights all due to leave within a relatively short time. Instead of forming queues for each separate desk, one queue was to be formed for all of them - a total shambles. This led to a bottle neck of people trying to even get into the queue, not a safe situation at all! They were the only company offering a direct flight from Glasgow on the days we needed, and were therefore our choice. For a budget airline the price we paid was way OTT.

Seating is not very comfortable, especially when you are tired and the seat does not recline, but it's not too bad on short-haul flights, The cabin crew was nice and friendly even when my companion forgot his boarding pass on the bus leading to the aircraft. The food and beverages are sold at decent prices (sandwich - 4 euros, snacks 0.5-3 euros, water - 2 euros, meal combo which includes a sandwich, a drink, and a snack - 7 euros). The quality of the food is quite good compared to airplane food. I continued with them to Rome Ciampino and returned to Tel Aviv with them via Bucharest. They have been consistent throughout all of these flights. Wizzair does not offer in-flight entertainment, but you can bring your own - no big deal.

When I was boarding I was told my carry on luggage is too big and they made me pay £40 to allow it in. That's £80 extra on a flight costing £200 which made the trip even more expensive than luxury airlines but will all the hassles of cheap airlines such as uncomfortable seats no tv system no food or drinks and very tight leg room. Annoyingly when I got onboard I saw that my luggage perefectly fitted under the seat so the whole thing was a sham. I had a feeling about it as I have travelled with this luggage for many years and never had a problem.

First of all there is a trick on the prices as they only include a backpack, instead of the common cabin luggage allowed by all other airlines. In their defence I will say they advise you when you are buying the ticket and days before you arrive to the airport, but it does not avoid people being charged by £60 that are complaining and slows the queue to get into the plane. Once onboard you can easily realise how small the seats are, they are incredibly tiny even in comparison with other low cost like Easyjet or Jet2.com, even Ryanair have bigger seats.

I passed customs and I had to wait around 8 hours at Gdansk to catch a LOT flight to Krakow the next morning. I would say that the price I paid was worth it, even though the service was not great.

I've learnt from recent experiences that such delays are common for Wizz Air. I spent my night in the airport and wasted a train ticket to my final destination due to this long delay as the airline refused to fulfill the legal obligation of providing accommodation (see Citizens Advice website), for which I will be taking my complaint further. They will milk you for every surcharge and attract customers by advertising cheap outbound fares outbalanced by significantly more expensive inbound fares. Doesn't work out as low cost in the end.

They charged us (2 people) 80GBP for having our small cabin bags not fitting in the measuring device in height by 1cm - we've traveled before with the same bags more than 10 times and no one said anything before.

The thing was that if you paid 45 euros per bag you were able to take your hand luggage with you on board, otherwise the option was to pay 65 euros per bag and put them on the hold of the aircraft what it is more than understandable as many airlines advise you to do it online when you buy your ticket if you have luggage to check in, but that it wasn't the case. We had a very nice time in Budapest and we enjoyed a lot but we came back with a very bad taste because the airline wanted to make profit with our hand luggage.

I'm used to surcharges - but they've even invented a difference between small and large cabin luggage, effectively forcing you to buy some additional luggage, even for weekend trips. Added costs not only for checked-in luggage - for for the usual cabin bag. Next, check-in. I arrive at Billund, there are no check-in machines. Arriving at the check-in counter (where the three couples before me in the queue were all shown off for having too large luggage), I am told that if they are to check me in (I did not do it online, I never do, but I am not late or anything), it will be an extra cost. Nothing had been mentioned about this in emails from Wizz Air. At both the check-in counter and the ticket office, where I am sent, they refuse responsibility in the usual weak agency manner, we're not Wizz Air, we're just airport reps. The final cost for checking in two hours before is DKK 270 (incl 30 in airport fee) - around 25% extra on the ticket price. It will be the same again, if I don't check in on the return leg. The feeling that they will milk you for every surcharge they can is pervasive. Inside the flight, the leg space is the narrowest I've experienced, even on low cost airlines, and the airplane is just generally dirty. The staff service was courteous, although of course food and drinks must be paid for. If you're on a short weekend trip around Europe, pay another DKK 500 for another airline (you'll pay it in fees anyway), and don't let an amateur airline ruin your good mood from the outset.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Warsaw,April 2017,1.0,2.0,,,1.0,,2,no,False,Copenhagen,Warsaw,,Negative,-0.891

I use this route (Eindhoven to Brno) and carrier a lot, and I love it. Both airports are rather small and super convenient. You don't need to be there hours before departure, in Brno 40 minutes is enough, for Eindhoven I suggest 50 minutes when you fly in the morning. Of course, it is a low cost carrier, so there is no inflight entertainment and you have to pay for your drinks. Furthermore, you have to pay for a large hand luggage. But if you are aware of this, it is perfect. I normally take my backpack and its more than enough. When you are expecting to fly more often with Wizz, you can join the Wizz discount club, it will cost you 30 euros a year and it is beneficial when you fly more than twice a year with them. The flight itself was perfect, staff was not extremely over friendly but just friendly. I got empty seats next to me and I was allowed to change to the window seat.

The driver was not present, the engine was off, the heating was off - we were left waiting outside for 20 minutes (I am in my mid 20s, I was fine standing, but what about elderly passengers?) on a freezing cold bus. Let me point out, the flight is at 6.20 in the morning, so the outside temperature is below freezing. There were no staff at the bus who we could have raised our concerns with. While boarding the staff did not care about maintaining lines / queues / checking priority boarding details, we paid extra and had to queue behind a whole bunch of people without PB to eventually be squeezed into a cold bus. This wasn't my first time flying Wizz, my overall opinion is that the Staff at the airports are not motivated at all - I would even say that they could not care less about the passengers. The organisation of the boarding process is awful, we were met with a rude attitude - especially from the ground handling staff. Obviously this is a low-cost airline, so you are prepared to have some inconveniences, such as small leg room, extreme departure times, ridiculous baggage policies etc. I have flown with Wizz 5 times in the past 18 months - as it is the only direct flight between Glasgow and Budapest, however after the horrific experience last time we have decided to fly KLM via Amsterdam.

Well, that was in theory - skipping the fact of difficulties with communicating in English with the stewardess, she informed a ""service"" like that is not included in the price of cheap flights and if I'm feeling too nervous about the flight, the crew will be forced to make me leave the plane. Definitely not the best way to calm down a passenger, and that kind of attitude was shown right before the Christmas time.

In all the years I've travelled this route there was 1 (one) serious delay (over one hour), all other departures were roughly on time and arrivals often well ahead of scheduled time. The bottom line with Wizz is a simple one - you should be well prepared for all aspects of your trip and strictly adhere to their luggage/boarding pass rules (which seem to cause the most confusion but are all readily available to consult on their website in many languages) and you'll have absolutely no hassle. Measure your luggage by dimension and weight and, if in doubt, purchase it online, don't leave it for the airport. Always print your own paper boarding pass. Other than that, the seats are non-reclining, pretty hard and tight, the legroom is very restricted unless you purchase it as an extra but the planes are mostly brand new and reasonably clean. The cabin crew is occasionally a little blasé and aloof but far from unpleasant, and most of the time the service is quite satisfactory. Wizz Air may not be to everyone's taste but If you travel frequently and you travel light, it is in my view a reliable budget carrier which has recently built a much better reputation than it is generally known for.",A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LTN to BEG,September 2016,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4,yes,False,LTN,BEG,,Neutral,0.4754

Paid £19.99 each for Wizz Air transfer from the hotel to the airport. Given a time in which to expect our driver to arrive. For our flight at 18:40 our driver was due to arrive between 16:05-16:35. He did not turn up between these times, I thought perhaps he was picking up other people but when he arrived (10 minutes later) we found we were the first to be collected. At this point we had an hour to get to the airport but had to collect other people on the way, we did not start the journey until 17:20. By the time we got to the airport around 18:00 we had to run to our gate which said it was boarding only to find my luggage bag was considered ""large"".

I'm writing to complain about the ridiculous business model of this airline. Our outbound flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, which shifted our plans around which meant we had to cancel one hotel, book another, and meant we paid for an extra day of our car rental that we didn't need. However this delay did not qualify for any compensation from the airline. On the inbound flight, we tried checking in online on our way to the airport, like many reasonable people do - but found out they have created an arbitrary window that if you check in less than 3 hours before your flight, you have to pay 35 euros per person. So in summary, Wizz Air delaying our flight and making us have to re-arrange hotels and our plans for the first day of our trip means they owe us nothing, but if I try to do something as basic as check in for the flight I already paid for, I have to pay an additional 35 Euro (70 Euro for my girlfriend and I together). On top of that, if you want to call them to complain about it, they charge you 1.3 Euros/minutes. The whole business model is a scam, it just aggravates consumers to be absolutely robbed at every stage of the journey.

The cabin was really new and clean. Seat pitch average,  I liked their tray table, which was a unique design. It was slightly higher than the tray tables on other airlines, so I was able to put my arms on it and took a 40 minutes nap comfortably during the flight. I didn't purchase anything on board, however the price was very competent compared to other budget airlines, especially the price of alcohol.

When I got to the airport I was informed that I was in fact not 'fully' checked in because I had not printed out my boarding pass. When I tried to say that I had checked in online and was given a seat, I was informed that this mistake occurred to passengers all the time and that only passengers travelling with Wizz Air frequently, avoided penalties. The fine for not printing out the boarding pass was about 30EUR each. When I asked how someone could support such a scam I was told by the neighboring ticket agent that if I made any more comments I would not be able to board the plane. Finally anyone saying that the seat comfort is ok in their review is lying - at least on the planes between Poland and Norway.

This is a low cost carrier and this review is based upon the understanding that you know what that means and my ratings would be lower if it was a full service airline. Having said that I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Wizz Air again. Their website makes it clear what you get with a barebones ticket. A seat and small cabin luggage. Want anything beyond that and you have to pay for it. We actually went for added check-in luggage and as this was partially a shopping trip, more allowance on the way back from Budapest. You do need to make sure you understand that 30 days in advance you can check-in for your flight. That's when you should as that will give you the best options when picking your seats. We didn't get this so had to make do with somewhat less than optional seating, but it worked out in our favour actually. So this is a late afternoon flight out of Iceland. Check-in was efficient, but when we entered the terminal many food options had closed. As it turned out when flying to Budapest so had most of the food on the plane. The plane felt new and shiny. Seats OK, you can't lean back at all. This is actually somewhat better as I found it easier to get in and out of the seatrow. Cabin staff were lovely, they look like they enjoy what they are doing and apologized for the lack of food options. But the Hungarian beer and red wine are both to be recommended. Now in Budapest check-in was again efficient and the airport is fantastic. Definitely one of the best in Europe with great variety of shopping/food options. However, the check-in to the aircraft made me feel a bit like cattle being led to the barn. But it worked. Flight back to Iceland was smooth.

We were ushered into a hangar where, at the entrance, there was a member of staff checking our tickets. They would look at your suitcase and your boarding pass, and if they didn't like what they saw, they would confiscate your boarding pass and give it to another member of staff. A group of about 5-10 of us were set aside. There, you were asked to measure your bag by putting into the bag size checker. My suitcase would fit perfectly but it was about 5cm too tall. The staff then used a measuring tape (I'm not kidding) to highlight that my bag was 5cm above their 42x32x25cm requirements for a free small cabin bag. I was travelling with my wife. She has a bigger suitcase than me, so I had paid extra for her luggage, but not for mine which is significantly smaller. Despite me telling them repeatedly that I have never paid extra with other low cost airlines such as Ryanair for either my wife's or my suitcase, that this was a daylight robbery, that I had paid for one bag already, that my suitcase did fit into their size checker, that this was very poor customer service on their behalf - they did not budge. I had to pay 45 euros to take my suitcase with me. I was appalled by this. If 5cm is worth more to them than gaining loyal customers I will not choose to fly with them ever again.

Once they did, they turned everyone around without giving any information, except for the plane not being ready. They kept everyone waiting for 20 minutes and asked to return whatever they bought at the airport and follow them to a Wizz Air customer desk. This is when we found out that the plane never departed from Wroclaw (it was supposed to fly to Birmingham then back) and the flight is being cancelled. Not from the people that were supposed to help us or give out information. My dad gave them a call in Poland as the flight was long cancelled to find out that the plane has a technical issue.  All of the passengers had to go through a single service desk. 200 people. 1 desk! The Wizz Air customer service representative loudly exclaimed that he is not going to deal with anyone and will go home if people do not stop asking questions without waiting in line. It was around midnight already and many people did not not know what was going on, lots of them had no way to get home at this hour. Customer service was horrible, they just gave out ""your rights"" forms with a grumpy look on their faces without answering questions. We had the right to reschedule a flight to some other airport at the closest possible date. Wizz Air is supposed to provide shelter, food and transport in these cases. Do you think they did any of that? They don't care about their customers. When I asked them about it they told me to file a complain online. If it wasn't for kind people passing on information between each other, lots of them would not know what was going on. Luckily I came to the airport with my car, so I was able to book a flight at Luton next morning. What about all these people that did not have an option like that? When I got into the car I called the customer service quoting my rights and asking for help regarding my car park and dealing with the cancellation. The guy I called had no clue what to do in situations like these, he was no help at all. I hang up in anger as they charge ridiculous amounts for the calls.  I left the car park, booked another one at Luton and rushed home because the morning flight was at 9am. Thats when I found out that I had a return flight booked back to Birmingham. I called them to get this flight changed as well and they charged me 30 pounds for changing the booking even though I quoted the whole situation. The flight was supposed to take place 3 weeks ago. I still haven't been contacted by Wizz Air to receive my compensation and refund. I called customer support today and they just kept on asking for reference numbers and had no idea which one was correct. Then he informed me I will be contacted within 30 days but he thinks that there is no need for a refund.  I am very disappointed by their service, flight quality, the space between seats is so small.

Furthermore, trying to argue about the size stated on the ticket and the counter person's definition is pointless as there is no manager available to verify the size. Again, most positions are not manned by people who can make one decision, instead they're only there to follow some ominous rules that I'm willing to bet they don't even know themselves.

It was here that the staff member took a tape measure and measured my bag to tell me it was 7cm - yes 7cm over their guidelines in height. Despite it fitting in their bag tester stand that most airlines have. They informed me this very specific measurement was in their booking t&c's and that I had to now pay £35 in fees to cover the extra 7cm. Despite the fact that my bag wasnt full and was half the weight of their 15kg allowance, and I flew out with them and no one said anything. I had to pay, and was very polite about it, and then reluctantly got back in the queue to get on the plane - watching about 50 other passengers also having to pay the £35 fee for the same reason.

My problem was when I got to the check in point and was told by the rudest passanger service agent that the name I had on my boarding pass was incorrect and I had to go to the office and change it. The problem is that changing your name will apparently cost you 100€. And my name was in fact right because it was my first and last name and never have I ever been bothered with such a thing. But according to the lady I should also have had my middle name. After further research online and on Wizz Air website I have yet to find any warnings that you are obliged to enter your full name. So I can only say that this is some kind of scamming to get people to pay for yet another fee. I did however manage to pass without changing my name which leads me to believe even more so that it is a scmm. Because if they in the end let me go through without any changes or extras paid it must mean that the alteration is not necessary, Even more so since I did the opposite flight (Lisbon to Budapest) and had no problems whatsoever.

The email says: Please don't forget to check-in online or via the mobile application at least 3 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of your flight (at airports where online check-in is not available airport check-in is free of charge). So went to the airport confident, when I got there they said this is not a free check-in airport as it has online check-in (by the way good luck to catch the wifi there). They made me pay 40 euros extra charge just for the check in. People were in queue to pay each 40 EUR. Everybody there was very upset and their customer service personnel smiling at asking to pay the fees. I also saw a lady with a small cabin bag that couldn't fit in their luggage checking cage (with Ryanair that would have passed easy). She had to pay another 50 eur.

We tried hard to reach the callcenter of WizzAir from Austria and Germany but without success.

I phoned their free booking query line and was told, yes, there was a problem and that free airport check in had been applied. We flew from Luton with no problem, the check-in was indeed free. On the return, however, no free airport check in had been applied. As I attempted to explain to both airport staff and the Wizzair folk when I phoned them, I couldn't check in for either flight and explained this when I phoned initially. I assumed, wrongly, that free airport check in had been applied to the return flight too. I was told when I phoned that I needed to go through the online complaints department. Having had to pay approx €70 to check us in at the airport I realise I will not see this back again. This is not sustainable for any airline, the reviews here show I am one of many.

Cabin bag size was strangely small, while booking the ticket and just in case I measured the bag, which was pretty tight between 40-42cm (max, Wizz allows for small bag, is 42cm.) In airport they pulled me over and told to put the luggage in the steel box, they have. So I did and to my great surprise, they insisted, I have to pay, since the wheels are little bit out from the box (not even an inch!) Since I measured the luggage at home with proper measuring line, I insisted they show me the actual length of the box. Of course, now it turns out, this supposedly is not their job, but nonetheless I am forced to pay 40 euros on spot. To make the situation less awkward, they gave me an option, though, which was to leave the bag behind! Lucky for me, I am spot on with the terms and conditions and this was the only thing, I had to pay extra this time, but I saw few people paying ridiculous sums of money just for having online check in and no paper to go with it. Seats on plane couldn't be tilted and the flight attendants go non-stop, selling stuff on isles, so no chance to sleep, unless you are tired to death. No Wifi and media stations, either.

We were already late and asked her to help with the procedure cause the gate was about to close. She didn't return an answer and then directed us to some guy to pay for our luggage. When we were paying for our luggage the employee told us that we had to pay 40 euros. Nothing matters at that point so we did pay the amount of money. While we were going back to the check in desk, the lady had left the place with our check in printed letters with her. Looking at the receipt that the employee gave us the price 40 euros was in fact 35 euros that had corrected the first price that was 14 euros. We didn't lose our flight.

Initially I was fine with this, but after speaking to their Call Centre I was left very angry and upset with Wizz Air's customer service levels. Firstly, they told me that there were no alternative flights they could offer, which again was not a major problem as I assumed that they would agree to refund my outbound flight from Bristol to Sofia. I was wrong. They refused to offer a refund for the unaffected flight even though I booked both sectors at the same time, and seemed happy for me to fly out to Sofia and leave me stranded there with no way of travelling onwards without paying significantly more money to rebook with a different airline. The call centre agent constantly criticised me for repeating myself which, even if true, is extremely poor service. Ironically, he kept repeating the mantra of 'you will have to complain via the website'. To put this into context, I was refused a refund of just £38 for the unaffected flight which is a very small price to pay to keep a customer happy and to give me the option to rebook alternative flights. As it turned out, the small matter of £38 means that I will never book with Wizz Air again - not because of the flight cancellation (which I can accept) but because of their very poor customer service levels.",,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,SOF to LBC,March 2016,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,1,no,False,SOF,LBC,,Negative,-0.9067

First, the web price went up 40% in one day, probably due to the use of cookies, since someone else 10 minutes later had my original price displayed, though this is difficult to prove. As, it now seems, many others, I got caught by the ""small cabin bag"" rule which frankly, is the most stupid thing I heard. Paying more for checked baggage is logical, since there is more handling. But space in the aircraft is debatable: my suitcase is not large, and I have only one, compared with other having a suitcase, a handbag and some shopping to top this up! So on top of the 250 euros price tag (+ CC fees, of course), which is far from ""low cost"", I paid another 40+40 for my so called big suitcase. The seats are squashed, I was sat at 90 degrees for 2.10 hours (not a short flight!), but luckily my neighbor did not show up and I could move to an aisle seat. The staff at the gate or in the plane was not particular friendly, but I would not be happy working for that company and I suppose it would be reflected in my attitude. One of the stewardess seemed in a complete rush to close all the compartments, which made me nervous. There is no inflight entertainment and no wi-fi, but that is expected, I suppose. You have to pay for food, but they don`t accept Sterling, but the stewardess took my pound as a euro so I could get some peanuts (and she makes 20% in the process, I suppose).

Outward flight was RyanAir (cheap, even with priority boarding and seating) out to Krakow. On the return leg, I took a ticket with options for transfer, large bag and priority boarding and seating on WizzAir flying out of Katowice. Very positive experience, no crowding. I needed a visa check and staff did this for me though it was more than 2 hours before the flight time. Onboard experience was better than Ryanair -  more legroom, cleaner and fresher interiors, good food.

I paid for the ticket recently and have been asked if would like to extend my membership for another year. I accepted and paid what I thought was a fee. I buy the membership every year. While I try to book another flight I was told my membership expired, just made a call to their customer service and tried to clarify. Call charge is over £1 per minute and in total it costed me around £14. I have been informed I paid previously extention for a group travel membership instead of whole year single membership. I clearly remember accepting extended annual meembership and didn't think for a second it was any extension. I was booking flight for myself so would not need group membership anyway. So ended up paying fee for some extention didn't ask in the first place, paid for call and still have to pay for annual single membership. Just wanted to make people aware when you buy the membership to make sure. The other thing is customer service team likes to go away from their desk to consult the claim so the clock is ticking and you end up paying for it. Responses made on their website remain unanswered.

We checked in on-line from our hotel the day before, having paid for cabin and check-in baggage. On arrival at Budapest airport we were told we didn't have a boarding pass and couldn't fly unless we paid an additional $140. I explained that we had already checked in with the boarding pass on our iPhones but they weren't interested. The desk where we had to front to get our boarding passes had 1 staff member and the wait meant that we very nearly missed our flight. The staff were chasing us after security to find the plane hundreds of metres away on the runway.

At the gate, they then charged me for the large (2cm above their length measurement) bag they had prevented me from checking in as well as my hand luggage, and also took away my boarding card.  At the stairs to the airplane they said my bag had to go in the hold (so much for paying to avoid having to wait for luggage for those so inclined). Boarding, I didn't have a boarding card, but they let me board anyway - I had to ask where I should sit.

Checking in on their website was nearly impossible, the first day it timing out several times for no reason, and the next day not permitting me to enter passport information correctly - I had to start again several times, and wasted an hour of my day.

They charge a fee even for hand luggage, unless it's small enough to be put under the seat in front, as was mine. As Bucharest is off the Schengen area, there was a passport control before going to the gate, No queue and easy. The aircraft was clean and the cabin crew agreeable.  The seats are a bit hard; there is a pocket at the back of the seats, with rather an interesting in-flight magazine. The flight was uneventful; it departed a bit late from Charleroi but arrived on time at Bucharest Otopeni airport, docked at an air bridge, with exit through the front door only.

1094,Alesya Makarova,United Arab Emirates,2015-10-06,1,"My husband and I were disappointed with our WizzAir flight on 24 August 2015 from Sofia to Dubai. We booked this flight on 11 February 2015 (6 months before), and paid an additional 79 Euro each for the Wizz Plus package that includes all the extras. Shortly after our booking, Wizz Air introduced seat allocation and we used the Wizz Air mobile app to choose our seats (as there was no such option on their website). This was the most tedious process: after each seat allocation the app blocked me from further actions because I had to pay 9 Euro, even though this was free-of-cost for the Wizz Plus package holders. I had to call them onto their international Customer Care number after each seat allocation to clear the bill. After we finally managed to allocate the seats, we received the email confirmation from the Customer Relations Department (Wizz Air Hungary) for our reserved seats together on the 1st row. Firstly, when we arrived to the Sofia airport, we were given two completely different to our booking seats (not even together). After showing the confirmation and the email form The Customer Relations Deptartment, the airport staff issued new boarding passes to us for seats 1F and 1E and we proceeded to the security checks etc. Upon boarding we discovered that our seats 1F and 1E were taken by other passengers with the same boarding passes as ours. Obviously those passengers refused to move and we had to be seated at the end of the plane far away from each other as the crew could not do anything and blamed ground handlers at the Sofia Airport. There were several other passengers on this flight facing the same issue (same seat allocation as other passengers), and it was very unfair and caused a chaos before take off. Passengers were still standing unseated while the plane was already moving. This completely ruined the end of our holiday as we had to travel separately for no fault of ours whatsoever. I send the detailed complaint to Customer Relations Department and also placed an official complaint using their website link. I also requested to cancel our upcoming one-way flight with Wizz Air in January 2016 from Sofia to Dubai. Since then I have sent them numerous reminders to respond, raised numerous requests online to follow up on my complaint, even called their ""Customer Care"" who could not or did not want to assist whatsoever and said that the Customer Ralations Department must have been very busy and get back to me ""shortly"". Until today I have not heard from them. This is the worst service I have ever experienced in my life, and from my experience, Wizz Air don't care about the passengers, their concerns or their comfort. I will never, under any circumstances, purchase another ticket for their flights.

1095,C Innes,Australia,2015-10-06,1,"The flight was OK and the cabin staff were very friendly, it was the getting on the plane that caused considerable grief and disappointment. Firstly, I booked the ticket over a month before I travelled (flight was on 13/9/15). I left Australia for Europe on 1/9/15. The airline sent my ticket the day after I booked, however they didn't send any of the ""fine print details"" (and these are very, very important) until 11/9/15. I was in Budapest enjoying myself at this time and felt everything had been previously organised. When I arrived at the check-in counter at 4am on the 13/9, I was told I had to pay a 45 euro check-in fee for not previously printing off my boarding pass. When I questioned this, I was rudely told either pay or we will cancel your ticket. As I was on a schedule and basically had no choice, I paid. When I got home and checked the email sent well after I had left, they stated that a fee of 20 euro would be charged for this service. I have since emailed the airline a number of times expressing my concern over the 25euro variation and have (as expected) received no reply.

The flight was further delayed by half an hour, and then we were moved to a large metal room with lots of tightly packed corridors, where we stood for roughly 20-30 minutes before boarding. When we were actually on the flight, it was not too uncomfortable, but I did get charged an extortionate amount for half a cup of coffee (around £2.50 I think). As we pulled into the gate at Luton we were informed that we would have to wait. We waited for about 15 minutes, before we were allowed off the plane. we then proceeded to baggage handling, where we stood for approximately 90-120 minutes, with no indication as to whether our baggage was actually at the airport, before it finally arrived.
